Patients with attenuated nonketotic hyperglycinemia make variable developmental progress. Predictive factors have not been systematically assessed. Methods: We reviewed 124 patients stratified by developmental outcome for biochemical and molecular predictive factors. Missense mutations were expressed to quantify residual activity using a new assay. Results: Patients with severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia required multiple anticonvulsants, whereas patients with developmental quotient (DQ) > 30 did not require anticonvulsants. Brain malformations occurred mainly in patients with severe nonketotic hyperglycinemia (71%) but rarely in patients with attenuated nonketotic hyperglycinemia (7.5%). Neonatal presentation did not correlate with outcome, but age at onset 4 months was associated with attenuated nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine levels and CSF:plasma glycine ratio correlated inversely with DQ; CSF glycine > 230 lM indicated severe outcome and CSF:plasma glycine ratio 0.08 predicted attenuated outcome. The glycine index correlated strongly with outcome. Molecular analysis identified 99% of mutant alleles, including 96 novel mutations. Mutations near the active cleft of the P-protein maintained stable protein levels. Presence of 1 mutation with residual activity was necessary but not sufficient for attenuated outcome; 2 such mutations conferred best outcome. Divergent outcomes for the same genotype indicate a contribution of other genetic or nongenetic factors. Interpretation: Accurate prediction of outcome is possible in most patients. A combination of 4 factors available neonatally predicted 78% of severe and 49% of attenuated patients, and a score based on mutation severity predicted outcome with 70% sensitivity and 97% specificity.",

A second limited exempt chart review study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board. Some clinical details of 12 patients were previously described. 2,5,[16][17][18] All patients had classic NKH evidenced by elevated CSF glycine levels, elevated CSF:plasma glycine ratio, normal urine organic acids, and mutations in either GLDC or AMT excluding variant NKH. 19,20 Medical records were abstracted through a questionnaire with data listed in the Supplementary Table, and a clinical investigator (J.L.K.V.H. or J.B.H.) examined the vast majority of patients. Age at symptom onset was considered neonatal if symptoms occurred in the first week of life, with later onset specified. Glycine levels were recorded at diagnosis, excluding blood contaminated CSF samples. 20 Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports were reviewed for structural abnormalities. Because in NKH seizure propensity increases during the first year of life and improves on benzoate treatment, therapy resistance of the seizure disorder was estimated from the number of concurrent antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used after age 1 year and while on benzoate therapy. 2 The glycine index was calculated by subtracting the molar glycine intake in food from a dietary recall from the molar dose of sodium benzoate needed to normalize plasma glycine levels divided by body weight, which reflects a whole body balance of glycine metabolism. 18 Enzyme assay results were recorded. Neurodevelopmental outcome was systematically assessed. Patients whose sole developmental milestone consisted of the ability to smile were given a developmental age of 6 weeks and categorized as severe NKH. Those making developmental progress beyond this stage were categorized as attenuated NKH, and formal developmental testing at an age > 2 years was used to derive a developmental quotient (DQ). Typical measures used were Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Mullen Scales of Early Learning, or Wechsler Scale of Intelligence. For each child, a DQ was calculated. The DQ is a measure of the rate of development. By using the mean or median age at which a milestone presents, a functional age equivalent for a child's development is given. It is the ratio of development age to chronological age. Subjects were subcategorized as poor attenuated NKH if DQ < 20, as intermediate attenuated NKH if DQ 20 and < 50, and as mild attenuated NKH if DQ 50. Patients without formal developmental assessment were categorized as attenuated NKH, not otherwise specified, if they could grasp and sit or walk independently, and as severe NKH if they could only smile.",

For instance, mild mutations p.T269M and p.A202V located in the 9th a-helix, and severe mutations p.R515S and p.G761R affected the structural interaction of the N-and Cterminal halves of the protein. 28 Cotransfection studies were done to review if observed combination of 2 mutations would affect the residual activity given the dimeric structure of P-protein.

This inaccurate prognostic information was frustrating for the families. The majority of patients with attenuated NKH, even mild, presented neonatally, and predicting prognosis based on age at onset alone was inaccurate. Moreover, single case studies of a new treatment, such as dextromethorphan, exhibited the same prognostic pitfall attributing the attenuated outcome to the drug treatment when, because of the neonatal presentation, the patient was expected to have a severe outcome. 29 A more accurate prognostic stratification is required for adequate clinical trial evaluation. A reliable measure to predict outcome in NKH was not yet available, 30 and past small studies had contradictory conclusions on the predictive value of glycine levels. 7,14 In this study, we categorized patients with NKH according to outcome, rather than age at onset, using developmental attainment as the primary outcome measure, which correlated well with neurological indicators such as the presence of brain malformations and the number of AEDs used to treat epilepsy. Attenuated NKH was distinguished from severe NKH by the presence of a variable degree of development, 2 and despite its continuous nature was subdivided in categories to facilitate statistical analysis.  This study provides strong evidence that genotype is a primary determinant of outcome, and presence of residual activity relates to outcome, as had previously been hypothesized from individual cases. 7,8,11,22 Two mutations without residual enzyme activity are associated with severe outcome, and attenuated outcome requires at least 1 mutation providing residual enzyme activity. Lack of residual enzyme activity in severe patients results in a larger glycine pool, which requires more sodium benzoate to normalize glycine levels as reflected in a greater glycine index, 18 which showed the best discrimination between outcome categories. This larger glycine pool results in increased brain and CSF glycine levels. CSF glycine correlated significantly although not strongly with outcome measures, but at the extremes CSF glycine >230 lM predicted severe outcome and low CSF:plasma glycine ratio 0.08 predicted attenuated outcome. Of the clinically useful predictors, which are listed with sensitivity and specificity in Table 4, age at onset, brain imaging, CSF glycine, and CSF:plasma glycine ratio are available in the immediate newborn period to enable counseling of parents. Using these 4 predictors available at diagnosis (age at onset 4 months, CSF glycine >230 lM, CSF:plasma glycine ratio 0.08, and brain malformations on MRI), 78% of severe patients and 49% of attenuated patients would be accurately identified. A simplified panel of 7 mutations (p.A202V, p.A389V, p.A802V/E, p.T269M, p.L548V, p.G607S in GLDC and p.I106T in AMT) identified 55% of attenuated patients, and could be implemented for rapid prediction in the neonatal period.",

Combined sequencing and exonic deletion-duplication analysis identified 99% of causative alleles in GLDC and all in AMT, and constitutes the preferred confirmatory diagnostic testing. Due to the documented 1% de novo mutation rate, carrier status of parents should be verified and not assumed in the context of recurrence risk counseling and prenatal diagnosis. The large genetic heterogeneity complicates the analysis of genotype to phenotype relation. Caution is necessary when using generic rules in predicting whether a mutation would retain residual activity. Phylogenetic conservation was unhelpful, with most mutations affecting conserved amino acids regardless of residual activity, yet p.A569T affects a poorly conserved amino acid but had no residual activity. Mutations affecting the 2 essential splice donor/acceptor nucleotides severely disrupted splicing, but IVS18-2A>G was a notable exception. To evaluate missense mutations, we developed a new effective expression study, with results agreeing with the few previous publications. 27,31 The amount of residual activity associated with attenuated outcome was very low. Mutations that result in unstable protein tend to be located away from the active cleft, and even reduce the A glycine index of 3 mmol/kg/day for a child on breast milk or regular infant formula with intake of 150 ml/kg/day calculates to a sodium benzoate dose of 510-540 mg/kg/day to bring glycine levels within therapeutic range (120-300 lM).",

In this study, 69 of 124 patients carried at least 1 GLDC missense mutation, and 13 of 27 GLDC missense mutants created unstable proteins, including common mutations such as p.R515S. The impact of current therapy with benzoate and dextromethorphan has been limited. A theoretically new therapeutic option of a chaperone or a proteostasis regulator that increases protein levels could increase enzyme activity and positively affect outcome in at least 27% of patients. 32 The relation between residual activity and outcome is complex. The number of alleles with residual activity relates to outcome, but there was not a direct correlation between DQ and the amount of residual activity in this eukaryotic expression system. Patients with a similar mild mutation sometimes had a very different outcome in this study, and substantial intrafamilial variability in large families has been noted. 14 This suggests that factors additional to genotype contribute to outcome. 11,31 For patients with attenuated NKH, the nature and timing of early treatment has been suggested as a potential factor. 30 Although this study is the largest ever in NKH, it does have limitations. Patients were evaluated from a very wide geographic region, allowing for generalization in this rare condition, and therefore encountered a variety of methods to evaluate developmental outcome. Analysis of developmental and behavioral outcome subcategories was not possible and will require a systematic analysis at a few centers using standardized measures. A wide spectrum of behavioral and developmental problems was noted in preliminary analysis of a few patients with attenuated NKH. The MRI review was limited to brain malformations as described in the report of the reading radiologist, and detailed analysis, such as the distribution of diffusion restriction, requires further study. 33,34 A detailed description of the seizure type, electroencephalogram, or response to specific antiepileptic medications could not be systematically captured, and requires a separate study. The number of AEDs used, which could be accurately recorded, is significant because the need for >2 AEDs, as seen in severe NKH, relates to the presence of therapy-refractory epilepsy. 35 This study documented several factors predicting prognosis, including the presence of brain malformations, the CSF glycine level, the CSF:plasma glycine ratio, and the type of genetic mutation. This information is valuable to parents and clinicians to allow better prediction of outcome. Prediction of severe outcome can help families in considering withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy in the neonatal apneic phase, given the current lack of effective therapies in this setting. 15,36 It is also important in the stratification of patients in treatment studies. Different treatment responses may exist between severe and attenuated NKH. 30,36 The relation between residual activity and outcome suggests that novel strategies to improve residual activity such as chaperones may have a beneficial clinical effect and should be researched. The complex relationship between genotype and phenotype indicates that additional factors will need to be identified to make such a strategy fully successful.",
