HCV prevalence is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with the general population; safe and efficacious therapies in renal impairment are needed. Objectives To evaluate simeprevir renal excretion in healthy subjects and to compare the simeprevir steady-state pharmacokinetics between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects. Methods In the mass balance study, healthy adults received a single 200-mg dose of 14 C-simeprevir; radioactivity in the urine and feces was quantified until concentrations were \\2 % of the administered dose and seven or more stools were produced. In the pharmacokinetic study, non-HCV-infected adults with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate B29 mL/ min/1.73 m 2) and matched healthy subjects (estimated glomerular filtration rate C80 mL/min/1.73 m 2) received 150 mg simeprevir for 7 days. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed post-dose on Day 7. Results 14 C-simeprevir recovery from the urine was low (0.009-0.138 % of total dose). The minimum plasma concentration, maximum plasma concentration, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve at 24 h were 71, 34, and 62 % higher, respectively, in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects. The mean fraction of simeprevir unbound to protein was \\0.0001 (all subjects). Most adverse events were grade I or II; one subject with renal impairment who was receiving fenofibrate presented with grade 3 rhabdomyolysis. Conclusions Simeprevir plasma concentrations were mildly elevated in subjects with severe renal impairment. The results suggest that simeprevir may be administered without dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment.",

            "text": "Increased morbidity and mortality and reduced longterm graft survival in transplant recipients have been demonstrated in patients with CKD with coexisting HCV infection [8,9]. Therefore, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines suggest that all patients with CKD and HCV infection be evaluated for antiviral treatment [1]; however, treatment of HCV in patients with severe renal dysfunction can be challenging [10]. Renal catabolism and filtration are important in the clearance of both ribavirin and interferon [11], resulting in increased exposure to both agents in severe renal impairment [12][13][14]. Increased exposure may lead to reduced tolerance [higher dropout rates have been reported in subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treated with pegylated interferon] and an increased risk of ribavirin-associated hemolytic anemia, which is proportional to plasma concentration [15,16]. As a result, dosing adjustment is required in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of B50 mL/min for ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2b and a CrCl of\\30 mL/min for pegylated interferon alfa-2a [13,[17][18][19]. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates to interferon monotherapy are increased in patients with CKD (ESRD on hemodialysis) compared with patients with normal renal function, likely secondary to increased exposure; however, they are lower than those reported for interferon and ribavirin combination therapy, which is often avoided in subjects with severe renal impairment [1,[20][21][22]. Sofosbuvir, a nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor, is primarily eliminated in the urine, and increased exposure in renal failure has been reported; the sofosbuvir package insert states that a dosing recommendation cannot be made for patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD [23].",

Combination therapy with simeprevir has demonstrated high SVR rates in both phase II and III trials for patients with HCV genotype 1 with normal renal function [29][30][31][32][33][34]. In treatment-na\u00efve patients, the phase III QUEST-1 and QUEST-2 trials demonstrated SVR rates of 80 and 81 %, respectively, in subjects receiving simeprevir plus ribavirin and pegylated interferon, compared with a SVR rate of 50 % in subjects receiving pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone [33,34]. In prior relapser patients, the phase III PROMISE trial demonstrated an SVR rate of 79.2 % in subjects receiving simeprevir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, compared with an SVR rate of 36.1 % in subjects receiving pegylated interferon and ribavirin alone [31]. Even higher SVR rates of 92-94 % were observed using combination therapy with simeprevir plus sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin in the phase II COSMOS trial [35]. Phase III trials have also demonstrated the efficacy of simeprevir in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection and in patients with genotype 4 (simeprevir is approved for the treatment of genotype 4 in Europe and Australia) [36,37].",

Pharmacokinetic analysis on Day 7 revealed no major differences in the shape of the plasma concentration-time curve between groups (Fig. 2).

Simeprevir is a once-daily, oral HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection, as a component of combination antiviral therapy [28,29]. In phase II and III studies, simeprevir has been demonstrated to be safe, with high SVR rates when used in combination with ribavirin and pegylated interferon or sofosbuvir [29][30][31][32][33][34]. These two studies demonstrated that simeprevir has minimal renal excretion and that its pharmacokinetics are not altered to a clinically significant degree in patients with severe renal impairment, which suggests that simeprevir may be administered without dose adjustment in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.",

This suggests that simeprevir is primarily eliminated by biliary excretion with insignificant renal clearance. These results are consistent with preclinical studies that demonstrated that simeprevir was predominately distributed to the liver and intestines with low distribution (similar or less than plasma) to the kidneys [38,39]. These results suggest that renal    T max (h) 6.0 (4.0-9.0) a 6.0 (4.0-9.0) a 0.0 0.0, 0.2 AUC 24h area under the plasma concentration-time curve for 24 h post-dose, CI confidence interval, C max maximum plasma concentration, C min minimum plasma concentration, LS least squares, T max time to reach C max a Values presented are the median (range) impairment would be unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of simeprevir; however, given that severe renal impairment may affect pharmacokinetics through diverse mechanisms, such as alterations in cytochrome P450 activity, conjugation reactions (glucuronidation and acetylation), and intestinal or hepatic transport, a pharmacokinetic study (Study 2) in subjects with severe renal impairment was also performed [40]. Pharmacokinetic studies of simeprevir in subjects with severe renal impairment demonstrated that most subjects with renal impairment reached steady state within 7 days; these results were comparable to subjects without renal impairment in both this study and in previous studies [28]. Slightly higher plasma concentrations of simeprevir were seen in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects with a C min , C max , and AUC 24h that were approximately 71, 34, and 62 % higher, respectively. The 90 % confidence intervals were wide because of the small sample size and high inter-subject variability. These mild increases in simeprevir plasma concentrations are unlikely to be clinically significant. In addition, the concentrations observed in this study (non-HCV-infected subjects with renal impairment) were within the range of concentrations observed in phase III studies (AUC 4848-449,185 ng\u00c1h/mL) in HCV-infected subjects without renal impairment [41]. It is important to note that subjects with HCV infection have been shown to have two-to threefold higher concentrations when compared with non-HCVinfected subjects and, therefore, simeprevir concentrations in HCV-infected patients with renal impairment would be expected to be higher than those observed in this study [28].",

The results obtained in this study are consistent with those seen with other N3/4 protease inhibitors used to treat HCV, such as boceprevir and telaprevir. These agents have similarly demonstrated minimal renal excretion and nonclinically significant pharmacokinetic alterations in subjects with renal impairment [18,24,25,[43][44][45].",

For ribavirin, a 14 C-ribavirin excretion study demonstrated that 61 % of radioactivity was excreted in the urine following a 600-mg 14 C-ribavirin dose [12]. A study comparing the pharmacokinetics of ribavirin between 18 subjects with renal impairment (mild, moderate, or severe) and six healthy subjects demonstrated a decrease in apparent clearance of approximately 50-75 % and a twoto three-fold increase in AUC in subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment following a single 400-mg dose [46]. For interferon-a 2b , a single-dose pharmacokinetic study of 20 subjects with renal impairment (all severities) and six healthy control subjects found decreases in apparent clearance of up to 45 % and a 90 % increase in AUC and C max in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subjects, following a 1-lg/kg subcutaneous dose [14]. The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of interferon-a 2a may be less pronounced as it is largely metabolized by the liver; the package label reports a 25-45 % reduction in clearance in ESRD on hemodialysis [13,18].",

The package insert reports that 80 % of 14 C-sofosbuvir was recovered from the urine following a 400-mg 14 C-sofosbuvir dose [23]. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies in subjects with renal impairment have demonstrated increases in the area under the curve to infinity (AUC inf ) of 61, 107, and 171 % in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, respectively, compared with subjects with normal renal function, following a single 400-mg dose [23]. Because the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir have not been established in people with severe renal impairment (eGFR \\30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), no dose recommendations were given for these individuals [23]. Moreover, the use of simeprevir in combination with sofosbuvir in patients with renal impairment has not been studied.",
