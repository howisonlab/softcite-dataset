            "text": "Development of the palate comprises sequential stages of growth, elevation, and fusion of the palatal shelves. The mesenchymal component of palates plays a major role in early phases of palatogenesis, such as growth and elevation. Failure in these steps may result in cleft palate, the second most common birth defect in the world. These early stages of palatogenesis require precise and chronological orchestration of key physiological processes, such as growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.There is compelling evidence for the vital role ofTGF\u03b2-mediated regulation of palate development. We hypothesized that the isoforms of TGF\u03b2 regulate different cellular biofunctions of the palatal mesenchyme to various extents. Human embryonic palatal mesenchyme (HEPM) cells were treated with TGF\u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23 for microarray-based gene expression studies in order to identify the roles of TGF\u03b2 in the transcriptome of the palatal mesenchyme. Following normalization and modeling of 28,869 human genes, 566 transcripts were detected as differentially expressed in TGF\u03b2-treated HEPM cells. Out of these altered transcripts, 234 of them were clustered in cellular biofunctions, including growth and proliferation, development, morphology, movement, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Biological interpretation and network analysis of the genes active in cellular biofunctions were performed using IPA. Among the differentially expressed genes, 11 of them are known to be crucial for palatogenesis (EDN1, INHBA, LHX8, PDGFC, PIGA, RUNX1, SNAI1, SMAD3, TGF \u03b21, TGF \u03b22, and TGF \u03b2R1).These genes were used for a merged interaction network with cellular behaviors. Overall, we have determined that more than 2% of human transcripts were differentially expressed in response to TGF\u03b2 treatment in HEPM cells. Our results suggest that both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22 orchestrate major cellular biofunctions within the palatal mesenchyme in vitro by regulating expression of 234 genes.",

            "text": "Cleft lip and/or palate is one of the most prevalent birth defects worldwide (1 in 800 live births; Schutte and Murray, 1999;Spritz, 2001), and is caused by failures in palate development. The formation of a continuous palate is a complex process composed of multiple steps, including palatal shelf growth, elevation, attachment, and fusion. Palatogenesis in the human spans from approximately gestational day 48 to 59 and the outgrowth of the secondary palate can generally be detected around day 49. During day 54-55, the palatine processes rapidly elevate, assuming a horizontal position which allows them to grow toward each other, attach, and fuse (Wyszynski, 2002). In general, with slight variation among strains, the stages of palatogenesis in mice [12.5-16.5 days post coitum (dpc)] are extremely similar and comparable to that of humans; therefore, mice have been used as a model to study human palate development (Ferguson, 1988). The failure of palatal shelves to grow and adhere after elevation is the most common type of cleft palate defect documented in murine models (Chai and Maxson, 2006). The palatal cellular components originate from the cranial neural crest (CNC)-derived palatal mesenchyme, concealed with a veneer of pharyngeal ectoderm-derived epithelium (Ito et al., 2003;Nakajima et al., 2010). A precise and time-sensitive regulation of various mesenchymal biofunctions, such as cellular movement, cell death (apoptosis), cell morphology, cell cycle progression, development, and growth and proliferation, is fundamental for the proper development of the palate. These cellular functions are coordinated by numerous genes encoding a range of growth factors, signaling mediators, transcriptional factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix proteins (Richman and Tickle, 1989;Pisano, 2004, 2005). Therefore it is immensely important to explore the genes and the molecules that regulate the plethora of these biofunctions to understand cellular behavior during palatogenesis.",

            "text": "The TGF\u03b2 family consists of more than 30 ligand proteins, including activins, BMP, and TGF\u03b2 cytokines, regulating a wide variety of biological processes such as cellular development, morphology, movement, growth and proliferation, survival, mitotic regulation, apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although the three isoforms of TGF\u03b2 (\u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b23) are highly conserved between species (Rotzer et al., 2001) and share 71-76% sequence identity, these ligands have isoformspecific activities that cannot be compensated by other family members (Iwata et al., 2011). Based on knockout mouse models, TGF\u03b2 isoforms have been found to be essential for normal morphogenesis of the palate (Iordanskaia and Nawshad, 2011). TGF\u03b21 null mice are embryonically lethal and die before 11 dpc (Brunet et al., 1995), so its role in palate development cannot be evaluated. TGF\u03b22 knockout mice, which are also embryonic lethal at 18 dpc, have defects in their mandible and maxilla, with 23% of cases resulting in cleft palate (Sanford et al., 1997); whereas all TGF\u03b23 null mice develop cleft palate (Kaartinen et al., 1995;Proetzel et al., 1995) and die within 24 h after birth. Furthermore, TGF\u03b2 mutations and expression patterns have been shown to be associated with the occurrence of cleft lip and/or palate (Stoll et al., 2004). Mutations in TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23, as well as their variants, are associated with cleft palate in humans (Lidral et al., 1998;Mitchell et al., 2001;Kim et al., 2003;Vieira et al., 2003;Rullo et al., 2006;Guo et al., 2010;Salahshourifar et al., 2011). Moreover, in vitro studies of human tissues showed that TGF\u03b21 and \u03b23 are differently expressed and correlated with the cleft lip and/or palate phenotype (Bodo et al., 1999). Overall, these findings underscore the crucial function of TGF\u03b2 isoforms in the optimal regulation and completion of palate development.",

During the sequential steps of palatogenesis, TGF\u03b21 is expressed both in the epithelial and mesenchymal components of the palatal shelves (Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Pelton et al., 1990). TGF\u03b22 is predominantly expressed in the mesenchymal cells, particularly immediately adjacent to the epithelium, with few epithelial cells also expressing TGF\u03b22 transcripts (Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Pelton et al., 1990;Gehris and Greene, 1992). Intense and distinct localization of TGF\u03b23 has been detected in the medial edge epithelium (MEE) of the palate (Fitzpatrick et al., 1990;Pelton et al., 1990). In our lab, we have demonstrated that TGF\u03b23 is also expressed in the palatal mesenchyme, albeit at a lower level compared to the palatal epithelium (Unpublished data). It has also been shown that each TGF\u03b2 ligand can signal via different receptor complexes and downstream signaling molecules resulting in divergent cellular functions and behavior (Abbott and Pratt, 1988;Iwata et al., 2011). Therefore the isoforms of TGF\u03b2 may behave uniquely in the palatal mesenchyme compared to the palatal epithelium.",

Using human embryonic palatal mesenchymal (HEPM) cells and bioinformatics tools, we analyzed how these isoforms regulate differential expression of transcripts and gene interaction networks within the palatal mesenchyme. Using microarray genechips, we found that expression of only 566 genes, which corresponds to >2% of the overall human transcriptome, were differentially expressed in TGF\u03b2-treated HEPM cells with statistical significance; including candidate genes recognized as inducers of cleft palate either in human or mouse (EDN1,INHBA,LHX8,PDGFC,PIGA,RUNX1,SNAI1,SMAD3,TGF \u03b21,TGF \u03b22,and TGF \u03b2R1). We also found that exogenous TGF\u03b2 can regulate different molecules of the canonical TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. Our results suggest that both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22, in concordance, regulate expression of 234 genes that govern cellular biofunctions which are crucial for the complete formation of the palate.",

Negative control samples were performed in parallel by omitting reverse transcriptase.

Negative controls containing no cDNA template were included for each gene within each qPCR run. To avoid variation in amplification conditions across runs, reactions for all experimental conditions (i.e., all untreated and TGF\u03b2-treated HEPM cells) for each gene of interest were performed as triplicates in the same 96-well plate. Cycling conditions were designed according to the RealMasterMix SYBR ROX handbook (5 PRIME, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) as initial activation at 95\u02daC for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95\u02daC for 15 s, 60\u02daC for 1 min. Amplification specificity for each gene was confirmed by a single distinct melting curve. Relative quantification of gene expression was determined by normalization of the samples with the internal reference gene, GAPDH. Data from the triplicates was evaluated and analyzed for significance by the pair-wise fixed reallocation randomization test using the REST 2009 software (Pfaffl et al., 2002).

There were no outliers identified by dChip, so all samples were carried on for subsequent analysis. When comparing two groups of samples to identify enriched genes in a given group, we used the lower confidence bound (LCB) of the fold change (FC) between the two groups as the cut-off criteria. If 90% LCB of FC between the two groups was above 1.2, the corresponding gene was considered to be differentially expressed. LCB is a stringent estimate of the FC and has been shown to be the better ranking statistic (Li and Wong, 2001). By use of LCB, we can be 90% confident that the actual FC is some value above the reported LCB. Researchers demonstrated that (Ramalho-Santos et al., 2002) selecting genes that have a LCB above 1.2 most likely corresponds to genes with an \"actual\" FC of at least three in gene expression. For all genes scored, the FC was calculated by dividing the experiment value by the control value. If this number was less than one, the (negative) reciprocal is listed (e.g., 0.75 or a drop of 25% from control is reported as \u22121.25 FC). The reported FCs are the average of the independent experiments. All of the significantly changed genes (FC >1.2-fold down or up) were selected for the biofunctional analysis. p-Values less than 0.05 indicated a statistically significant, non-random association. The complete list of genes passing dChip's statistical filter for each treatment with their respective FCs and p-values was deposited to the gene expression omnibus (GEO) of NCBI (Accession number: TBD). To compare the results of our multiple microarray experiments, we drew Venn diagrams which depicted the relations among the TGF\u03b2 treatment groups as intersections or uniqueness using the GeneVenn (Pirooznia et al., 2007).",

In the heatmaps, each column corresponds to the averaged expression profile of a treatment in triplicate, and each row corresponds to an mRNA. The upper portion (green-tored) represents downregulated transcripts and the lower portion (red-to-green) represents upregulated transcripts. The increasing intensities of red signify a higher expression in the given sample of a specific mRNA, whereas the increasing intensities of green indicate a lower expression of mRNA and black indicates mean level expression. Functional analysis was comprised of finding gene ontology (GO) categories in the gene clusters of interest that warrant further investigation.

Following statistical analysis and filtering of the microarray data using dChip, Affymetrix probe identifiers, and fold-values of each treatment group were uploaded to IPA as a dataset. Each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the ingenuity knowledge base (IKB). Interactions were then queried between these datasets and all other gene objects stored within IPA to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were overlapped. The significant genes were categorized, compared to functional categories in the IPA database, and ranked according to their p-values. p-Values less than 0.05 indicate a statistically significant, non-random association between a set of significant genes and a set of all genes related to a given function in the IKB (Mori et al., 2009). Through the assessment of differentially expressed genes, cellular processes that are most significantly altered in our dataset were: cellular growth and proliferation, development, morphology, movement, cell cycle, and cell death. Using these IPA analyses, molecules within the cellular biofunction categories were filtered and imported to Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA, USA) for further graphical analysis of the networks.",

Genes from the table of cellular biofunctions (Table 1) were merged with the Table A2 in Appendix to filter the differentially expressed genes according to putative candidates for palatal deformities. Some of the genes listed were identified as being important for palatogenesis in mouse, but not directly associated with human cases of cleft palate and thus remain \"putative\" cleft palate genes in the latter, as labeled with asterisk ( * ) in the Table A2 in Appendix. Overlapping genes (n = 11) were presented in Table 2 with their FC and p-values. Among these genes, EDN1, INHBA, TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b22, RUNX1, LHX8, SNAI1, PDGFC, and PIGA were upregulated; while only SMAD3 was downregulated in response to TGF\u03b2treatment. Intriguingly, TGF\u03b2R1 was upregulated with TGF\u03b21 treatment and downregulated with TGF\u03b22 treatment; which correlates with FIGURE 3 | Direct and indirect relations of most differentially expressed genes with TGF\u03b2. Affymetrix probe identifiers and FC values of significantly altered transcripts (n = 27) were uploaded to IPA and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB. Interactions were then queried between these gene objects and all other gene objects stored within IPA to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were merged. Networks with the highest number of molecules were selected, overlaid with TGF\u03b2 molecules, and organized using Path Designer of IPA. Upregulated transcripts were highlighted with orange (A); and downregulated transcripts were highlighted with green (B). Types of molecules were annotated in the legend in the box.

Ingenuity pathway analysis, a knowledge based program to generate relevant and interacting biological networks, was used to determine how the differentially expressed overlapping genes might interact to facilitate cellular biofunctions. A direct interaction network of the orofacial deformity susceptibility genes, overlaid with clustered cellular biofunctions crucial for development and maturation of the palatal mesenchyme was generated and is presented in Figure 6. Finally, the localization of differentially expressed genes within the canonical TGF\u03b2 pathway was illustrated by using the IPA Path Designer in FIGURE 4 | Hierarchical clustering (heatmap) analysis of differentially expressed transcripts. Altered genes were clustered based on cellular biofunctions and heatmaps were constructed using Bioconductor. Coexpressed groups of genes were illustrated with dendrograms and progressively and distinctly up-or downregulated genes were ranked accordingly. Each column corresponds to the expression profile of a treatment (either TGF\u03b2 or Control) in triplicate, and each row corresponds to a transcript. The increasing intensities of red signify a higher expression in the given sample of a specific mRNA, whereas the increasing intensities of green indicate a lower expression of mRNA and black indicates mean level expression. The list of genes for each particular function (A-F) was shown in Table 1.  Table 3. The full list of these genes, including non-significantly altered, is provided in Table A4 in Appendix.",

In order to explain this reorientation and extension several hypotheses have been proposed, including: mesenchymal proliferation and organization (Jin et al., 2010), mesenchymal and muscular contraction (Innes, 1978), generation of hydrostatic forces by hyaluronan (Goudy et al., 2010), and epithelial reorganization (Babiarz et al., 1979). Taken as a whole, cellular changes within the palatal mesenchyme, which composes the majority of the palatal shelves, governs the optimum growth and elevation of the palatal shelves prior to adherence and fusion (Ito et al., 2003;Iwata et al., 2010Iwata et al., , 2011. HEPM cells, which were extracted from a single human abortus at the time of palatal shelf elevation (Yoneda and Pratt, 1981), have previously been used in several studies, including: determining the mechanisms of cleft palate development induced by various teratogens (Dhulipala et al., 2004(Dhulipala et al., , 2011, the role of various growth factors active in the regulation of palate development (Takechi et al., 2008), and the teratogenic potential of environmental agents (Watanabe et al., 1990). Therefore, HEPM cells serve as a physiologically relevant model to study differential expression profiling of genes which function in palatal growth, elevation, and extension; which are all indispensable for mammalian palatogenesis.",

Therefore, only 8 genes were detected to be differentially expressed in response to TGF\u03b23 treatment in HEPM cells (Table 1), while expression of more than 500 genes was altered in TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22 group. Based on these criteria of microarray data analysis, we concluded that TGF\u03b23 treatment did not result in significant changes in expression levels of transcriptome of HEPM cells.",

For several years, Venn diagrams have been shown to be the most effective graphical analysis tool to demonstrate similarities, differences and distinctions within gene sets (Kestler et al., 2005;Pirooznia et al., 2007). In our study, we used Venn diagrams to illustrate the number of altered genes within the HEPM cells in response to TGF\u03b2 isoform treatments as overlapping and individual gene numbers (Figure 1). The number of genes differentially expressed by TGF\u03b22 is much higher than Frontiers in Physiology | Craniofacial Biology FIGURE 6 | Merged interaction network of cleft palate susceptibility genes and biofunctions. Affymetrix probe identifiers and fold-values were uploaded to IPA and each identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IKB. Interactions were then queried between these gene objects and all other gene objects stored within IPA to generate a set of direct interaction networks that were merged. Cellular functions that directly interact with differentially expressed putative candidate genes for cleft palate in response to TGF\u03b2 treatment of HEPM cells were included in the network. The 11 transcripts meeting the 0.05 criteria of FDR in response to TGF\u03b2 treatment were analyzed for the direct interaction network using IPA. Upregulated genes (EDN1,INHBA,TGF\u03b21,TGF\u03b22,RUNX1,LHX8,SNAI1,PDGFC,and PIGA) were highlighted with orange and downregulated gene (SMAD3) was highlighted with green. TGF\u03b2R1 was upregulated with TGF\u03b21 treatment and downregulated with TGF\u03b22 treatment, thus highlighted with cyan. Fx, cellular function; CP, canonical pathway.",

This, combined with the observation that TGF\u03b22 is expressed primarily in the mesenchyme region (Fitzpatrick et al., 1990), indicates its important role within the palatal mesenchyme. Since TGF\u03b21 is expressed in both the palatal mesenchyme and epithelium, it has been proposed to facilitate crosstalk between the cell types during palate development (Fitzpatrick et al., 1990). Therefore, it is expected that TGF\u03b21 would affect more genes compared to TGF\u03b22 and TGF\u03b23. Surprisingly, the number of genes significantly altered by TGF\u03b23 was minimal, which may suggest that TGF\u03b23 is less involved in the regulation of cellular functions of palatal mesenchyme. However, this does not rule out its major role within the MEE during palatogenesis. Meanwhile, the high number of differentially up-and downregulated genes within the intersection regions, particularly between TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22, suggests that TGF\u03b2 isoforms may simultaneously coordinate the development of the palatal mesenchyme. We identified a strong correlation of gene expression patterns between microarray and qPCR data in terms of up-and downregulation of significantly differentially expressed genes, but not relative level of expression. Expression profiles of all 27 genes tested were found to be in agreement between the two methods (Figure 3), further confirming the reliability of the hybridization-based gene expression assay.",

The heatmaps also showed us that most of the genes altered significantly in response to TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22 followed a very similar pattern, unlike TGF\u03b23, which effected gene expression to a lower extent in the HEPM cells (Figure 4).",

Given its role as a mediator in normal physiology and its high-level expression in response to TGF\u03b2 treatment, we propose that VDR mediates the communication between TGF\u03b2 and Vitamin D during palatogenesis. Further verification of this intermediation may also shed light on the importance of Vitamin D as an environmental etiological factor of cleft palate. It has been proposed that palatal shelf elevation can be driven by the growth (and movement) of the facial skeletal muscles inducing mechanotransduction pathways, which in turn regulate cytoskeleton remodeling, cell proliferation, and tissue differentiation (Innes, 1978;Farge, 2011). MSC (musculin), also known as MyoR, is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)-type transcriptional regulator of myogenesis; and we detected its expression as upregulated with TGF\u03b2 treatment. Considering its capability of binding to the Ebox element and muscular movement during palatogenesis, we postulate that MSC and TGF\u03b2 isoforms can modulate each other's expression in a feedback loop during palate formation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have determined that more than 2% (n = 566) of the human genes were differentially expressed in palatal mesenchymal cells in response to treatment with TGF\u03b2 isoforms. According to GO annotation clustering, 234 of these altered genes (41%) were associated with cellular biofunctions. Nevertheless, only 11 of these transcripts were implicated in craniofacial deformities, which suggest that other etiological factors are correspondingly involved in the development of palatal constituents. Our overall results suggest that both TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b22 isoforms regulate the expression of genes that govern cellular biofunctions of the palatal mesenchyme; and this regulation is crucial for normal palatogenesis. Further elucidation of the significantly up-and downregulated genes at the protein level will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms controlling palate development; thereby pave the way for prevention of cleft palate during development.
