            "text": "Deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine creates mutagenic G \u2022 T mispairs, contributing to cancer and genetic disease. Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) removes thymine from these G \u2022 T lesions, and follow-on base excision repair yields a G \u2022 C pair. A previous crystal structure revealed TDG (catalytic domain) bound to abasic DNA product in a 2:1 complex, one subunit at the abasic site and the other bound to undamaged DNA. Biochemical studies showed TDG can bind abasic DNA with 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometry, but the dissociation constants were unknown, as was the stoichiometry and affinity for binding substrates and undamaged DNA. We showed that 2:1 binding is dispensable for G \u2022 U activity, but its role in G \u2022 T repair was unknown. Using equilibrium binding anisotropy experiments, we show that a single TDG subunit binds very tightly to G \u2022 U mispairs and abasic (G \u2022 AP) sites, and somewhat less tightly G \u2022 T mispairs. Kinetics experiments show 1:1 binding provides full G \u2022 T activity. TDG binds undamaged CpG sites with remarkable affinity, modestly weaker than G \u2022 T mispairs, and exhibits substantial affinity for nonspecific DNA. While 2:1 binding is observed for large excess TDG concentrations, our findings indicate that a single TDG subunit is fully capable of locating and processing G \u2022 U or G \u2022 T lesions.",

            "text": "A large percentage of point mutations in cancer and genetic disease are C!T transitions at CpG sites, resulting largely from replication of G \u2022 T mispairs created by deamination of 5-methylcytosine (m 5 C) to thymine (1)(2)(3)(4). Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is charged with finding these G \u2022 T lesions and removing thymine to initiate base excision repair, which ultimately restores a G \u2022 C base pair (5,6). Methyl binding domain IV (MBD4) is another DNA glycosylase that processes G \u2022 T mispairs arising from m 5 C deamination at CpG sites (7,8). About 4% of cytosines in mammalian DNA are methylated, selectively at CpG sites, and this key modification promotes transcriptional silencing and is essential for many cellular processes and for embryonic development (9). It is known that cytosine 5-methyltransferases catalyze the conversion of C to m 5 C at CpG sites in DNA, but the mechanism for 'demethylation' of m 5 CpG has remained elusive (9). Several recent studies indicate a BER-mediated pathway for active demethylation (10,11); many indicate a mechanism for active m 5 C deamination, giving a G \u2022 T mispair that could be processed by TDG (or MBD4) and BER to restore a G \u2022 C pair (12)(13)(14)(15)(16). A preliminary report that inactivation of TDG causes embryonic lethality in mice (17), the first such finding for any DNA glycosylase, is consistent with an essential role for TDG in transcriptional regulation, in addition to processing G \u2022 T mispairs arising from spontaneous m 5 C deamination.",

            "text": "Given the critical role of TDG in protecting against C!T mutations and its emerging role(s) in transcriptional regulation, it is important to obtain a detailed understanding of how TDG recognizes and processes lesions, how its activity is stimulated by the follow-on BER enzyme, APE1 and to characterize its interaction with undamaged CpG sites and nonspecific DNA. Our recent crystal structure of TDG (catalytic domain) bound to abasic DNA (18) revealed a remarkable 2:1 complex, with one TDG subunit bound at the abasic site and an adjacent subunit bound to undamaged DNA ( Figure 1). Such 2:1 binding had not previously been observed for TDG, MUG or UNG. Our previous biochemical studies showed TDG, full length and catalytic domain, can bind abasic DNA with 1:1 or 2:1 stoichiometry, depending on TDG concentration (18). However, the affinity for each TDG subunit (K d1 and K d2 ) remained unknown. Determining these values is important for understanding the catalytic mechanism of TDG and how its activity is stimulated by APE1, i.e. how the first steps of BER are coordinated. In addition, the stoichiometry for binding G \u2022 T or G \u2022 U substrates had not been examined. Although we previously showed 1:1 binding provides full catalytic activity for G \u2022 U lesions (18), TDG exhibits much weaker binding and catalysis for G \u2022 T relative to G \u2022 U substrates (19)(20)(21)(22), raising the question of whether 2:1 binding could be needed for efficient G \u2022 T repair. This is important, because G \u2022 T lesions are considered the predominant biological substrate for TDG (21,23). Our previous studies demonstrate TDG can excise bulky cytosine analogs from a CpG site in DNA (24), suggesting TDG may have substantial affinity for undamaged CpG sites, but this had not been determined. Additionally, previous studies suggest TDG possesses significant affinity for nonspecific DNA (25), but this has not been quantitatively examined. Determining the affinity and stoichiometry of TDG for binding CpG sites and nonspecific DNA is important for understanding its functions in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. We address these important questions here using pre-steady-state kinetics and equilibrium binding experiments.",

Previous studies show the benefits of using X-rhodamine or sulphorhodamine for monitoring protein nucleic acid interactions by fluorescence anisotropy (35)(36)(37). TDG was titrated into HEMN.1 buffer (above) that contained TR-labeled DNA, supplemented with 1% glycerol and 1 uM BSA. The DNA concentration was maintained at a fixed value throughout the titration by adding concentrated enzyme in buffer that also contained DNA. After each addition of TDG, the sample was incubated for at least 2 min before data collection to ensure binding was at equilibrium. This was confirmed by observation that the anisotropy was constant for at least 5 min (for some data points). Anisotropy data were collected in T-format, where one PMT is connected directly to the sample compartment (no monochromator) with wavelength selection provided by a 628-nm band pass filter (Semrock, Inc.). The excitation wavelength was 590 nm (3-nm band pass) and the single-emission monochromator was set to 615 nm (5-nm band pass). Wavelength selection for the monochromators was enhanced with 586 and 624 nm band-pass filters (Semrock, Inc.) for excitation and emission, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants for TDG binding to TR-labeled DNA were determined by fitting the fluorescence anisotropy data to appropriate models using DynaFit 4 (38,39). The models and DynaFit scripts used for data fitting are given in the Supplementary Data. The fitted parameters included dissociation constants for one or two binding sites on the DNA, and anisotropy values for free DNA (r D ) and for 1:1 and 2:1 complexes with TDG (r ED and r EED ). In many cases, the data clearly indicate two nonequivalent binding sites. Model discrimination was also informed by the probability value of the Fisher's F-statistic, obtained from data fitting, where P < 0.05 is considered significant. The reported parameters are derived from global fitting of at least two independent binding experiments. We determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for TDG binding to unlabeled DNA using equilibrium competition anisotropy experiments, where TDG binding to TR-labeled 16U F 11 was monitored in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled DNA. DynaFit was used for global fitting of the data to a model involving one or two TDG binding sites for the unlabeled DNA and two binding sites for TR-labeled 16U F 11. A benefit of using DynaFit for the data presented here is that data fitting does not require an analytical equation, which could involve assumptions that are not compatible with experimental restraints. Indeed, the standard model for two nonequivalent binding sites assumes the species being monitored (DNA) is present at much lower concentration than the dissociation constant. This is not feasible for monitoring TDG binding to 16U F 11, because the minimal DNA concentration needed for sufficient sensitivity in the anisotropy experiment (0.5 nM) approximates the dissociation constant (K d1 = 0.6 nM, see below).",

We and others have shown the U F and T F analogs are excellent mimics of the natural dU and dT substrates, because they allow formation of the catalytically competent enzymesubstrate complex in the absence of base excision (22,26,27,29). The U F and T F analogs differ from dU and dT only by replacement of 2 0 -H with fluorine (2 0 -fluoroarabino, Figure 2), which renders the base-sugar (N-glycosylic bond) of these and other nucleotides highly resistant to spontaneous and enzymatic cleavage. Previous studies show the 2 0 -fluoroarabino substitution, in dT and other deoxynucleotides, promotes an O4 0 -endo sugar pucker (rather than C2 0 -endo), which is fully compatible with B-DNA geometry (28,40,41). Although the O4 0 -endo conformation in a substrate analog could potentially alter the binding of a DNA glycosylase, our previous studies indicate the effect is small for TDG binding to DNA containing a T F analog (22).",

The anisotropy data show TDG forms a tight 1:1 complex with the G \u2022 U F site of 3U F 11, K d1 = 8.4 \u00b1 2.9 nM, and a second TDG subunit can bind with very weak affinity, K d2 = 2650 \u00b1 463 nM ( Figure 3D). The results of an EMSA confirm this binding stoichiometry ( Figure 3E). Although 2:1 binding to 3U F 11 is observed at high TDG concentrations, the second subunit must bind an alternate site from that seen in the crystal structure, as discussed below. Kinetics experiments show this alternate 2:1 complex does not contribute to G \u2022 U binding or processing, because catalytic activity is nearly the same for conditions that give 2:1 binding (saturating TDG) or 1:1 binding (saturating substrate, Supplementary Figure S.2). The finding that TDG binds tightly to 3U F 11 shows the 2:1 complex observed in the crystal structure is not required for specific recognition of a G \u2022 U lesion, consistent with previous kinetics experiments showing 2:1 binding is not needed for full G \u2022 U catalytic activity (18).",

Sedimentation velocity experiments show TDG is predominantly a monomer at concentrations of 20 and 50 mM (Supplementary Figure S3). This indicates the alternate 2:1 complex, with K d2 = 2.7 mM (for 3U F 11), is not comprised solely of protein-protein interactions (though such interactions might be enhanced for DNA-bound TDG). Previous studies show the disordered N-terminal domain of TDG (residues 1-120) forms nonspecific interactions with DNA (25,44), which may contribute to the alternate 2:1 complex. Consistent with this, K d2 is much weaker for the catalytic domain (TDG-core, 111-308), which binds 3U F 11 with K d1 = 83 \u00b1 46 nM and K d2 = 21 \u00b1 3 mM (Supplementary Figure S4). Previous sedimentation velocity experiments show TDG-core is fully monomeric at 120 mM (18). Thus, K d2 = 21 mM for TDG-core binding to 3U F 11 suggests the catalytic domain also exhibits nonspecific DNA interactions, because DNA binding seems unlikely to promote protein-protein interactions for TDG-core (18,45). Although the detailed nature of the alternate 2:1 complex is not presently clear, it only arises for large and excess concentrations of TDG, and it does not substantially alter catalytic activity.",

Nevertheless, we sought to determine whether 2:1 binding, if it occurs, could enhance catalytic activity for G \u2022 T substrates. We showed previously that 2:1 binding is dispensable for G \u2022 U activity (18), but the result could potentially differ for G \u2022 T activity, since binding and catalysis is much weaker for G \u2022 T relative to G \u2022 U substrates (Table 1)  (19,22). We used single turnover kinetics experiments with saturating TDG (5000 nM) and limiting G \u2022 T substrate (500 nM) such that 2:1 binding predominates. As shown in Figure 5A, the maximal rate of base excision is the same for a G \u2022 T substrate that can accommodate 2:1 binding (k max = 0.16 \u00b1 0.03 min \u00c01 ) and one that cannot (k max = 0.14 \u00b1 0.03 min \u00c01 ).

Such knowledge is important for understanding how TDG locates G \u2022 T mispairs arising at CpG sites and its role(s) in transcriptional regulation. We previously showed TDG exhibits exceedingly low activity for cleaving cytosine from a CpG site (<1% product in 8 h), thus binding studies can be performed in the absence of base cleavage (24). Anisotropy and EMSA data for TDG binding to 28-bp DNA containing a CpG site (16C11) are shown in Figure 7A and 7B. The anisotropy data indicate that TDG binds the CpG site with remarkably tight affinity, K d1 = 63 \u00b1 10 nM, and a second TDG subunit binds with much weaker affinity, K d2 = 965 \u00b1 148 nM, at high TDG concentrations.

We note that 4T11 is the minimal DNA construct that provides full G \u2022 T activity, due likely to non-specific interactions between the DNA (5 0 of the dT target) and the N-terminal region of TDG (unpublished data).

The parameters are very similar for 4T11 (open rectangle); k obs = 0.12 \u00b1 0.02 min \u00c01 , A = 117 \u00b1 3 nM, and k cat = 0.0002 \u00b1 0.0001 min \u00c01 . Observation of slightly greater amplitude for 16T11 indicates 1:1 binding to both substrates, because 4T11 cannot accommodate 2:1 binding, consistent with other results above. For G \u2022 T substrates, we typically find A < [TDG]. However, for G \u2022 U and G \u2022 FU substrates, we find A = $[TDG], indicating TDG is fully active (Supplementary Figure S1). We are currently investigating the basis of the diminished amplitude for G \u2022 T substrates. However, this does not alter our conclusion that 2:1 binding is not needed for G \u2022 T activity.",

We determined the affinity of TDG for 28-bp nonspecific DNA (NS28) using equilibrium competition binding experiments, by collecting anisotropy data for TDG binding to 16U F 11 (labeled) in the presence of fixed concentrations of unlabeled NS28 ( Figure 8A). Global fitting of data collected in the presence and absence of NS28 to a competitive model describing two binding sites for 16U F 11 and two equivalent and independent binding sites for NS28 The data were fitted globally to model with two TDG binding sites for 16U F 11 and 16C11, giving K d1 = 26 \u00b1 8 nM for 16C11, and K d1 = 0.59 \u00b1 0.14 nM and K d2 = 673 \u00b1 100 nM for 16U F 11 (anisotropy for 16U F 11 of r D = 0.182, r ED = 0.221, r EED = 0.274). K d2 for 16C11 is poorly constrained by the data (and unreasonably large). Fitting the data to a competition model with one site for 16C11 gives the same K d1 (within error). However, the data in (A) and (B) show TDG can form a 2:1 complex with 16C11. Global fitting of all data to model involving two TDG binding sites for 16U F 11 and two equivalent and independent sites for NS28 (i.e. restrained to K d2 = 4*K d1 ) gives K d1 = 293 \u00b1 64 nM and K d2 = 1172 \u00b1 254 nM for NS28. For 16U F 11, the fitting gives K d1 = 0.88 \u00b1 0.13 nM and K d2 = 654 \u00b1 62 nM (and anisotropy of r D = 0.189, r ED = 0.221, r EED = 0.278). Fitting the data to a model involving a single site for NS28 gives essentially the same result for NS28 binding, K d1 = 279 \u00b1 69 nM, and for the 16U F  (i.e. restrained to K d2 = 4*K d1 ) gives K d1 = 293 \u00b1 64 nM and K d2 = 1172 \u00b1 254 nM. The latter value falls in the range of K d2 values for other DNAs examined here (Table 1). Fitting the data to a model with just one site for NS28 gives essentially the same result, K d1 = 279 \u00b1 69 nM. However, the two-site model is consistent with a binding analysis by EMSA ( Figure 8B), which shows a 1:1 complex at lower [TDG]/[NS28] ratios and a 2:1 complex for large and excess TDG concentrations. Global fitting of the data in Figure 8A also provides a measure of TDG affinity for 16U F 11 in the presence of nonspecific DNA, and gives essentially the same dissociation constants as obtained in the absence of NS28. Our findings show TDG possesses substantial affinity for nonspecific DNA.",

This is likely explained by the methyl group at C5 of thymine (uracil has hydrogen at C5), which may diminish the lifetime of the dT nucleotide in the flipped state due to steric hindrance in the TDG active site, as suggested by our previous kinetics results (21,22,24). Given that G \u2022 T lesions arising at CpG sites are likely the predominant biological target of TDG (21,23), one might expect TDG to have evolved to bind more tightly to G \u2022 T mispairs. The weaker affinity for G \u2022 T mispairs may reflect a compromise between the competing needs for efficient processing of G \u2022 T lesions and avoiding the excision of T from the huge excess of A \u2022 T base pairs, which is governed in part by the 18 000-fold specificity of TDG for excising T from G \u2022 T versus A \u2022 T pairs (21).",

Our results here indicate that under the conditions used for these previous studies, limiting concentrations of TDG (and APE1) and a saturating amount of TDG substrate, TDG binds its product with 1:1 stoichiometry. Thus, the stimulatory effect of APE1 does not involve a TDG product complex with 2:1 stoichiometry. Consistent with this conclusion, we previously observed potent stimulation of TDG by APE1 for a short DNA that cannot accommodate two TDG subunits (3U12 substrate or 3AP12 product) (33). Together, these studies indicate the stimulatory effect of APE1 involves a TDG product complex with 1:1 stoichiometry.",

Previous studies suggest TDG may accomplish this by transiently flipping 2 0 -deoxycytidine (dC) out of a CpG site and into its active site (or flipping it partially into the active site). Our crystal structure indicates specificity for excising lesions from a CpG site involves interactions with the 3 0 -guanine (5 0 -XpG, X = lesion) that cannot be formed in the absence of nucleotide flipping (18), which suggests nucleotide (dC) flipping may be required for recognizing undamaged CpG sites. The ability of TDG to flip dC into its active site is indicated by our previous finding that TDG can cleave analogs of dC that have a weakened N-glycosylic bond (e.g. 5-fluoro-dC, 5-hydroxy-dC, etc.) (24). However, these results do not rule out a mechanism whereby TDG recognizes CpG sites in the absence of nucleotide flipping. Further studies are needed to resolve this question.",

In addition, the affinity of TDG for undamaged CpG sites and nonspecific DNA may be important for its ability to modulate the activity of transcription factors including retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors (48), estrogen receptor a (49) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (50), and co-activators such as CBP/p300 (51).

TDG forms a very tight 1:1 complex with abasic (G \u2022 AP) sites, indicating the stimulatory effect of APE1 does not require 2:1 binding of TDG to its product. TDG binds tightly to undamaged CpG sites, about 4-fold weaker than to G \u2022 T mispairs, and it exhibits substantial affinity for nonspecific DNA. While 2:1 binding to DNA is observed in vitro for large and excess concentrations of TDG, our results indicate that a single TDG subunit is fully capable of finding and processing G \u2022 U and G \u2022 T lesions.",
