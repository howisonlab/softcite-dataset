            "text": "The immune system is a powerful barrier to successful organ transplantation, but one that has been routinely thwarted through modern pharmacotherapeutics. Despite the benefits of immunosuppressive therapy, medication non-adherence leads to an increased risk of graft rejection, higher hospital utilization and costs, and poor outcomes. We conduct a scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework methodology to identify established or novel interventions that could be applied to kidney transplant recipients to improve medication adherence. As the desired outcome is a behavior (taking a pill), we assess three areas: behavioral-focused interventions in other industries, patient engagement theories, and behavioral economic principles. Search strategies included mining business, social sciences, and medical literature with additional guidance from six consultative interviews. Our review suggests that no intervention stands out as superior or likely to be more effective than any other intervention; yet promising strategies and interventions were identified across all three areas examined. Based on our findings, we believe there are five strategies that transplant centers and other organizations can implement to improve medication adherence: (1) Build a foundation of trust; (2) Employ multiple interventions; (3) Stratify the population; (4) Develop collaborative partnerships; and (5) Embed medication adherence into the organization's culture. The effectiveness of these interventions will need to be investigated further, but we believe they are a step in the right direction for organizations to consider in their efforts to improve medication adherence.",

            "text": "Despite the benefits associated with receiving a kidney, 10-year kidney transplant function continues to be low (50%), with a 60% increased risk of kidney failure attributed to patients not taking their immunosuppressive medications as prescribed. 1,2 The rate of non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications is reported to range from 30% to 35% for kidney transplant recipients. 3,4 For example, in the United States, more than 181,000 kidney transplant patients are living with a functioning kidney. If the rates of non-adherence are true, then roughly 55,000 to 65,000 patients are either non-adherent or at risk of becoming so. 1,5 This likely underestimates the true prevalence of non-adherence due to variations in the definition and measures of non-adherence as well as the fact that end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a global issue with the number of centers providing kidney transplants on the rise. 3,6 Previous studies have shown that medication non-adherence leads to suboptimal outcomes and has been observed in almost half of graft losses. [7][8][9] This outcome impacts patients and other stakeholders. For patients, failure to take immunosuppressive drugs is associated with decreased graft function, increased risk of kidney loss, and premature death. 10,11 About 25% of kidney transplant recipients who experience graft failure will die within 2 years, and overall life expectancy is 4 years less for recipients who are non-adherent to immunosuppressive therapy (IST). 10 For health care systems and payers, medication non-adherence leads to increased use of resources, higher hospital readmission rates, and potential need for re-transplantation and/or return to dialysis. 3,7,12,13 Graft failures resulting from medication non-adherence during the first year post-transplant are estimated to cost the United States US$100 million annually. 13 Additionally, return to dialysis carries an increased cost burden approximately twice that of caring for a transplant recipient. 1 As a global comparison, in Nigeria, a session of hemodialysis costs US$100 which is twice the minimum monthly wage for federal government workers. 6 In their 2015 systematic review, Low et al. 2 define adherence as the extent to which people follow their instructions to a prescribed treatment regimen. They further explain non-adherence can be either intentional or unintentional and occur for a number of reasons. In 2008, participants at a Non-adherence Consensus Conference agreed that the following five categories (which are aligned with the categories outlined in 2003 by the World Health Organization (WHO)) are associated with non-adherence: (1) socioeconomic, (2) patient-related, (3) disease-related, (4) treatment-related, and (5) health care setting/ provider-related. 2,3 Within these five categories, they identified 26 subcategories. 3 Constantiner and Cukor 10 simplified the number of factors to those repeatedly emerging as predictive of non-adherence such as minority status, gender, age, marital status, post-transplant symptoms, and time since transplantation. Chisholm-Burns et al. 12 included costs, forgetfulness, confusion over complicated regimens, psychosocial factors, and adverse drug effects. As predictive risk factors for non-adherence vary by individual and over time, health care organizations are challenged with developing successful and sustainable interventions that are tailored to the individual yet apply to a larger subset of the population to help manage resources.",

Chisholm-Burns et al. 15 reported inconsistent findings from interventions focused on improving adherence for adult renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Most recently Low et al. identified 12 interventions, 6 of which showed statistical significance. One study focused on reducing the dosing regimen to once daily, and the other five studies were multidimensional addressing informational, behavioral, and emotional elements. While the multidimensional interventions were more effective in improving medication adherence, some of the studies were limited by small samples sizes, study design, and duration of the intervention(s) (i.e. most were short-term ranging from 3 to 12 months). 2 We aim to identify strategies, techniques, and interventions that could be utilized by providers to help kidney transplant recipients improve and/or maintain adherence to their prescribed medications long term.",

However, patient engagement and behavioral economic interventions had more quantitative elements allowing us to group interventions by other criteria such as type of intervention, industry/disease state, study timeframe (duration), frequency of engagement (by whom), outcomes, and applicability to the kidney transplant population. As we populated the tables for analysis, we recognized that many of the patient engagement interventions were not novel and became redundant with other systematic reviews. Rather than replicating these studies, we stratified papers for frequency of interactions and durability of behavior change over time; both of which were our criteria for addressing applicability to the kidney transplant population (e.g. Is it feasible for transplant centers to implement this intervention from a resource and cost perspective and will the intervention be sustainable to improve 5-and 10-year graft function?). Behavioral economics literature did not appear in any combined transplant literature reviewed, so we included more details for this area in the narrative and through the use of a summary table, outlining the type of intervention, examples of how it has been used, and the advantages and disadvantages of the intervention as it relates to improving or changing a desired behavior.",

In setting parameters around key words searched and other industries, stages 2 and 2a, we may have excluded industries that could have proved beneficial to include. We believe our review of references and the inclusion of additional key words after our initial search helped prevent this from being an issue. At the onset of the study, we also set a timeframe and budget of 6 months to complete all five stages. As such, we had a cut-off time period for our literature search (stage 3), which may have resulted in relevant papers being missed. To correct for this, we included additional references from 2015 while editing the manuscript. In stage 4, to determine if a strategy or intervention was applicable to the kidney transplant population, we relied on existing literature and stratified studies based on resource need/consumption (frequency and type of engagement) and duration of the intervention over time.

In a report by Gallup, successful companies win customers for life by emotionally connecting to their customers and continuing to measure customer engagement. 20 Turbo Tax \u00ae recognizes the emotional needs and psychological barriers of tax payers that must be addressed to effectively engage them in the tax preparation process. Their online filing process uses statements like \"we double check your tax returns\" and provides positive reinforcement by showing refund amounts throughout the process to empathize with and nurture their customers. They also personalize the process and make it easy for customers to navigate by offering live chat or phone support and including features such as the ability to save and come back when needed. 21 An online survey by Fulcrum found that retail companies such as Baskin Robins, Ruby's and Starbucks, who recognized their customers' birthdays, not only strengthened the customer relationship but increased customer loyalty by 87%. 22 In grocery retailing, Guenzi et al. 23 found that customer trust in the sales associate and brand products increased perceived value and store loyalty. They recommend retailer's focus on building trust as an alternative to price cuts and promotions to foster store patronage. Even the military, which is based on command and control, emphasizes that a continuous flow of information between a senior officer and subordinates makes the system work. 24 In health care, there is a growing amount of evidence that patients who are engaged, active participants in their own care, have better health outcomes and measureable cost savings. 25 The challenge is that patient engagement changes over time indicating a need for transplant centers to continue to cultivate and preserve relationships over the long term (Hibbard J, 1 October 2014, consultative interview).",

Both AA and WW provide chips or tokens at specific milestones to recognize and reward a behavior. Many have described these as motivational, which help maintain the desired behavior. 26 360-degree reviews, when implemented correctly, provide a framework to recognize an employee's contributions and identify an action plan to foster continuous improvements and career development. 29 Similar to the barriers to medication adherence, motivational strategies to influence a behavioral change varies by individual.2,30 For example, WW offers in-person meetings and an online program. Determining which option will work best depends on an individual's will power and determination. The online program takes more discipline while the inperson meetings allow people to witness others with similar experiences, a technique that often provides the drive needed to keep people dedicated.31 This suggests that multiple interventions are likely to be needed to elicit an effective behavioral response for an individual or subset of the population.",

            "text": "Through our review of patient engagement interventions with a follow-up review of the transplant literature, many patient engagement interventions are known in the transplant community and are therefore not deemed novel. For example, education sessions, case-management, self-management, health coaching, and decision aids are all used to improve medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions and several of them are used by some kidney transplant centers. The issue is that they vary widely in their effectiveness and, where studied, only some lead to improved outcomes. In a systematic review of 20 interventions to improve adherence for chronic illnesses, Viswanathan et al. 33 found only one intervention-education with behavioral support through continued patient contact-showed consistent evidence of improved adherence. In another systematic review of 10 interventions, only integrative health coaching for diabetics was shown to improve adherence. The other nine interventions, which were primarily self-management programs, did show improvements in other factors such as self-efficacy, healthy behaviors, and outcomes (e.g. lower HbA1C), yet results varied by study. 32 Other methods such as behavioral contracts, MI, and appointment-based models (ABMs) (or medication synchronization programs) are also being investigated. Behavioral contracts have improved medication adherence in adult RTRs. 15 MI, an empathic, non-judgmental style of interviewing that encourages patients to determine and verbalize their own goals for a behavior or behavior change, improved medication and visit adherence over traditional methods. 30,34 In a RCT, Paradis et al. 35 found combining the transtheoretical model stages of change with MI-improved medication adherence for heart failure patients. Multidimensional interventions are increasing. In a 2008 meta-analysis, only 5 of 13 studies using mixed interventions improved adherence. 36 The ABM, an intervention which combines monthly pharmacy counseling sessions with prescription refill synchronization, showed patients using it were 3-6 times more likely to be adherent compared with a control group. 37 In 2011, Berben et al. 14 conducted a survey of current clinical practice to identify interventions used by health care professionals to enhance medication adherence in transplant patients. They classified interventions into educational/cognitive, counseling/behavioral, and psychological/affective. They found that interventions showing evidence of promoting healthy behaviors or improving adherence appear to be rarely used by transplant centers.

            "text": "From Figure 2, interventions identified as being more effective at improving adherence (e.g. behavioral contracts, support groups, peer mentoring, intense counseling by pharmacists) are used less frequently by transplant centers. Some interventions, used more frequently by transplant centers, such as establishing a partnership, providing written materials, and using cues, have shown evidence of improving adherence. 38,39 Interventions combing multiple strategies and targeting providers have also shown significant improvements in adherence; although they vary in their degree of effectiveness with minimal evidence supporting any one strategy. 2,17 As described in almost all studies mentioning the interventions above, many are personnel-intensive, costly, and have only been tested over a short duration. For example, studies that tested interventions such as counseling, health coaching, self-management programs, and behavioral contracting, involved frequent interactions (weekly, monthly, and quarterly) over a short-time period (ranging from 6 weeks to 24 months, with most interventions lasting 12 months or less). 15,32,38 Patient engagement interventions have expanded beyond the physician-patient relationship to other care team members-such as pharmacists, nurses, social workers, and case managers-and peer mentors. Joost et al. 40 found that 30-min counseling sessions with a pharmacist focused on educational, behavioral, and technical aspects improved medication adherence in kidney transplant patients. Peer-led workshops increased healthy behaviors among patients with HIV and other chronic conditions. 30,41 Technology-based interventions also are increasing. These include internet-based self-management programs, medication reminders via text message, telemonitoring, mobile applications, and social media. While there has been some success with internet-based programs, tablets and mobile apps, and text messaging, many of these are still in development and continue to have challenges. 32,42,43 For example, telemonitoring and iPhone chats with providers are not yet reimbursed and the use of electronic health records (EHRs) and social media are slow on the uptake; the latter is for fear of breaching professional confidentiality. 25,44,45 ",

Blumenthal-Barby and Burroughs 48 further explain that people are motivated by incentives-with more sensitivity to losses than gains. As a result, behavioral economic interventions are typically in the form of financial incentives and nudges, which preserve people's freedom by guiding them to a choice rather than specifying a designated treatment regimen. 46  Table 1 provides an overview of the types of nudges and financial incentives reviewed, select examples of where these have been utilized, and the advantages and disadvantages of each as they relate to improving medication adherence for kidney transplant recipients.",

            "text": "Behavioral economic principles have been used by other industries for decades. The most notable example is the 401(k) retirement plans from companies. Historically, companies offered employees the choice of enrolling in a 401(k) plan. By incorporating active choice, a strategy that requires individuals to select between options, companies experienced a 28% increase in 401(k) participation over the standard opt in procedure. Applying loss aversion through enhanced active choice (e.g. \"I don't want to enroll in a 401(k) plan and don't want to take advantage of the employer match\") has been shown to induce more compliance. 57,58 The federal Administration of Children and Families (ACF) used a series of interventions to encourage Texas prison inmates to lower the amount of child support they owe while they are in prison. The primary driver is that state welfare agencies are at risk of losing federal funding for late and unpaid child support payments. The interventions included sending a teaser postcard before the official letter arrived, printing materials on blue paper to distinguish it from other mail,  50 warfarin adherence 51 Diabetes/glucose control (combined with peer mentoring) 52 Smoking cessation 53,54  explaining other parents had successfully reduced their child support, and sending a reminder postcard for those that did not respond. While fewer than 50% of eligible inmates participated, a social science researcher at ACF explains this was a big impact at a low cost. 59 More recently, researchers have partnered with employers, insurers, and pharmacy benefit managers to develop (or investigate) the use of behavioral economics in the health care industry. Interventions have ranged from simple nudges such as promoting seat belt use or encouraging more healthy eating choices by putting the salad bar at the front of a buffet to increasing organ donation and providing financial incentives and peer mentoring to improve medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions. While many interventions target the patient, some target physicians. For example, a radiologist spent more time with a patient's report and felt more connected to the patient when the patient's picture was attached to an X-ray. Patients were 24 times more likely to have a sigmoidoscopy and 9 times more likely to have a fecal occult blood test relative to a control group when physicians suggested screening for colon cancer. 48 These types of nudges are geared toward individuals making one-time decisions (e.g. organ donation). If the goal is to improve medication adherence (a behavior that occurs frequently), then the intervention should occur just as frequently. Behavioral economists believe automated hovering is one way to do this. 55 Automated hovering has been described as a cost-effective way to monitor and provide feedback to patients. Examples include NudgerSize TM (an iPhone application that sends daily exercise reminders to users), electronic pill bottles, glucometers and other devices that transmit information from the patient to the provider. 55 Automatic entry into a daily lottery for taking pills is another example. While there are advantages to using automated hovering (e.g. less resource intensive option for daily engagement), it is not for everyone. Asch et al. 60 explain that cell phones and automatic pill bottle reminders are not ideal for someone frequently hospitalized who likely requires a more personnel-intensive approach. In a RCT using electronic pill bottles to improve warfarin adherence, only patients with baseline international normalized ratio (INR) below the therapeutic range showed significant improvements in anticoagulation, indicating that the intervention worked for only a subset of the population. 51 Studies using financial incentives to influence a behavioral response varied in their effectiveness. Of those with evidence of effectiveness, many included some form of interaction with health care professionals or peers, and most behaviors reverted back to baseline once the intervention stops. Similarly, offering co-payment reductions through value-based insurance design or linking premiums to healthy behaviors has only had modest impacts. 55 In a 2009 systematic review, adult RTRs, when offered free IST, were 95% adherent 6 months post-transplant yet only 48% adherent at 12 months with many becoming non-adherent by the 10th month. The conclusion was that cost does not appear to influence adherence. 16 Volpp et al. 61 explain the effectiveness of the incentive depends on how they are framed, timed, and distributed, and should ideally be small and combined with frequent positive feedback and rewards.",

Patients who take their medication are entered into a daily sweepstakes and eligible for cash prizes. Patients are then contacted the next day (via email, text, or voice recording) to (1) inform them of their prize or (2) inform them about what they could have won had if they had taken their medication. If patients miss more than two medications, a family member or other support person is contacted in an effort to provide social pressure to encourage adherence. If the patient misses four consecutive doses, then a clinical social worker is employed. Combining a behavioral nudge with technology, followed by involvement with a social worker if needed, is thought to improve traditional care management interventions. 46 Further studies of behavioral economic interventions within the transplant community will be needed to quantify effectiveness and cost feasibility.",

Similar to patient engagement, behavioral economic interventions appear to work best when they are multidimensional, combined with frequent engagement, peer mentors, and for a subset of the population that is at higher risk for poor adherence.

Patients must feel comfortable discussing potential reasons for non-adherence and understand why adhering to their treatment regimen is important. The literature supports the idea that adherence to medications depends on believing in the importance of the regimen, followed by the ability and capacity to take the pills. Most of the existing techniques assume patients are rational beings and that reminding them to take their pills will get the desired result. This may be necessary, but to date it has not proved to be sufficient. The patient must actually believe and trust that consistent adherence is more important than not taking the medication. Trust-building is personnel-intensive and requires frequent levels of engagement that will depend on the individual patient. 2. Employ multiple interventions-there is no consensus that a one-size-fits-all approach exists to improve medication adherence. What motivates one person may not motivate another. This holds not only across a patient population, but also for the individual. Behaviors are emotionally driven and dynamic. They can change daily and/or with major life events. Rather than have a laundry list of interventions to pull from, interventions should be prioritized and timed. For example: most in need. The use of peer-led workshops and support groups to keep people engaged has been useful, but the duration of the intervention for maintaining consistency is unproven. Further research is needed around how the frequency and duration of the interventions may impact long-term kidney transplant function.",

As patients tend to shift levels over time, the survey should be redistributed on an annual basis to confirm or modify each patient's activation level. With EHRs, organizations may also choose to look at other predictive risk factors such as age, education, and diversity/culture to create their own customized patient population strata. 4. Develop collaborative partnerships-a transplant center is only one part of the care team needed to support kidney transplant recipients. Creating smooth transitions will help maintain trust and maximize the likelihood that adherence remains a priority. Transplant centers need collaborative relationships with community nephrologists, primary care providers, and pharmacists among others to effectively help patients manage their conditions and minimize their confusion from a multitude of potentially conflicting, independent messages. Partnerships with payers may also prove beneficial especially as the industry continues to move toward value-based insurance design. Some transplant recipients become non-adherent 36 months post-transplant when Medicare stops paying for immunosuppressive medication. 5. Embed medication adherence into the organization's culture-an initial education session around nonadherence is not enough. In order to optimize longterm function of kidney grafts, transplant centers need to establish methods to measure and track adherence over time. Tools to assess risk for or development of non-adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens should be coupled with adherence-enhancing interventions and effectiveness assessments. Since many interventions can be personnel-intensive, demonstrating a positive return on investment (ROI) is necessary to compete in an era of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Having dedicated social workers and case managers to screen reasons for and provide solutions for non-adherence, along with dedicated pharmacists to help manage and monitor drug regimens, is a start.",

The transplant center's goal is to return kidney recipients to a functional life. As this occurs, the interactions between the transplant center personnel and kidney recipient decreases over time. While there is inter-and intra-patient variability in what factors keep a patient adherent, failure is more likely when interactions with health care providers diminishes. New approaches to either extend certain relationships or provide techniques that act as a surrogate to keeping the patient engaged and adherent are warranted. While the effectiveness of the interventions in the five steps outlined above remains to be determined, we believe these are a step in the right direction for transplant centers and other organizations to consider in their efforts to improve medication adherence.",
