N 2 O treatment is also expected to restore the fertility of interspecific hybrids through meiotic restitution or mitotic amphidiploidization. However, this technique has few applications to date, and it is unknown how N 2 O treatment restores fertility in sterile hybrids. To establish optimal N 2 O treatment conditions and determine its cytological mechanism of action, we treated various sized floral buds with N 2 O gas at different anther developmental stages from fertile and sterile hybrid lilies. N 2 O treatment using the optimal 1-4 mm floral buds induced mitotic polyploidization of male archesporial cells to produce 2n pollen in fertile hybrid lilies. In sterile hybrid lilies, N 2 O treatment doubled the chromosome number in male archesporial cells followed by homologous chromosome pairing and normal meiosis in pollen mother cells (PMC), resulting in restoration of pollen fertility. Backcrossing the resultant fertile pollen to Lilium \u00d7 formolongi produced many triploid BC 1 plants. Thus N 2 O treatment at the archesporial cell proliferating stage effectively overcame pollen sterility in hybrid lilies, resulting in fertile, 2n pollen grains that could produce progeny. The procedure presented here will promote interspecific or interploidy hybridization of lilies.",

In ornamental flower breeding, interspecific hybridization is an essential technique that produces novel cultivars, as driven by consumer demand. Many such cultivars are used as ornamental crops (Fukai and Tsuji 2004, Okazaki et al. 1992, 1994, 1995, Saruwatri et al. 2008, whereas hybrids obtained from remote interspecific crosses are mostly sterile and cannot be used in cross breeding (Choudhary et al. 2000, Gangadevi et al. 1985, Poysa 1990). The traditional method of overcoming hybrid sterility is to double chromosome number using polyploidizing agents such as colchicine to produce allopolyploids that may be fertile (Asano 1982, Nimura et al. 2006.",

The most important modern commercial lilies mainly belong to the Asiatic, Oriental, and Longiflorum hybrid groups, and over 10,000 cultivars, including many sterile interspecific hybrids, are registered (Matthews 2007). Barba-Gonzalez et al. (2006) obtained fertile 2n pollen from sterile lily hybrids by using N 2 O treatment. Postulating that N 2 O treatment could bring about meiotic restitution in sterile as well as fertile lily cultivars, they concluded from cytological analyses of progeny that N 2 O had induced FDR gametes in most cases. However, the particular FDR mechanism by which hybrid sterility can be overcome does not explain the finding of Kitamura et al. (2009). In their histological study on pollen meiosis in fertile plants treated with N 2 O gas for 24 h, microtubules were effectively depolymerized, which prevented chromosomes from moving to the poles and resulted in chromosome retention in the center of N 2 O-treated cells. Cell plate formation took place without delay, however, yielding one daughter cell with a diploid genome and another daughter cell without chromosomes. As a result, a 2n male gamete was produced during meiotic metaphase. In sterile interspecific hybrids where chromosomes are scattered in the cytoplasm owing to non-homologous parental genomes, the cell plate divides the chromosomes unequally to make aneuploid daughter cells with or without N 2 O treatment (Kitamura et al. 2009). This suggests that N 2 O treatment during meiotic division does not lead to chromosome doubling in a daughter cell through the FDR mechanism in sterile hybrids. The cytological mechanism of action of N 2 O treatment for overcoming hybrid sterility remains to be determined.",

The cultivars used are listed in Table 1: four fertile cultivars belonging to Lilium spp. Asiatic hybrid lilies, a fertile Oriental hybrid lily, two LA hybrids, an OT hybrid, and an LO hybrid. Two cultivars of L. \u00d7 formolongi were crossed with pollen from N 2 Otreated hybrids. Single bulbs of each cultivar were planted in 10-cm pots in October or November and grown in an unheated greenhouse at Niigata University, Niigata, Japan. Akutsu et al. 2007) was performed at room temperature for 48 h in a pressuretolerant cylinder, with N 2 O gas applied at 6 atm without oxygen. Prophase I and meiotic metaphase I in Asiatic hybrid lilies occur in 15-or 20-mm floral buds, respectively (Akutsu et al. 2007). In L. longiflorum, premeiotic mitosis occurs in 10-mm floral buds (Taylor and McMaster 1954), and N 2 O treatment during prophase I does not produce 2n pollen grains at flowering (Akutsu et al. 2007). Based on these results, we treated hybrid lilies with attached 1-10 mm floral buds, which presumably contained the archesporial cell proliferating stage. Buds were small at the time of treatment, making direct length measurements difficult. Hence, longitudinal lengths of detached floral buds from plants grown under similar conditions were measured with a caliper or ruler to estimate the floral bud sizes of treated plants at the time of N 2 O treatment. The treated plants were grown in a greenhouse. N 2 O treatments were conducted for Asiatic hybrid lilies, Oriental hybrid lilies and LA  2007, 'Yelloween' in 2007and 2008and 'Otome no Sugata' in 2008.",

Mean production rates of giant pollen in a treated flower were classified into five categories (Fig. 2). The efficacy of giant pollen formation fluctuated among treated flowers of 'Regata', with up to 83% (n = 128) of flowers having more than 3% giant pollen among the 155 treated flowers (Fig. 2). Flowers producing giant pollen grains with a frequency of higher than 50% occurred in 1.0-1.9 mm and 2.0-3.9 mm floral buds. The average rate of giant pollen production in the 1.0-1.9 mm category was significantly higher than in the other categories. N 2 O treatment using smaller floral buds tended to produce more giant pollen grains. Similarly, in Oriental hybrid lily 'Willeke Alberti', N 2 O  treatment induced giant pollen in flower buds ranging from 1-7.9 mm (Fig. 2). The average rate of giant pollen production in the 4.0-5.9 mm category was significantly higher than in the 1.0-1.9 mm category. Although there were no significant differences on giant pollen production rate among the 2.0-3.9 mm, 4.0-5.9 mm and 6.0-7.9 mm categories, we found flowers producing giant pollen with a frequency of higher than 30% in the 4.0-5.9 mm category. Therefore, floral buds ca. 5 mm long at the time of N 2 O treatment were likely to be suitable for induction of giant pollen. Thus, the optimal bud size of 'Willeke Alberti' was larger than that of 'Regata. The efficacy of giant pollen formation fluctuated among the treated flowers, as well as among the anthers within a given flower, in 'Willeke Alberti' and 'Regata' (data not shown).",

Transverse sections of the 1-3 mm floral buds showed actively dividing archesporial cells inside the peripheral layers of the stamen (Fig. 5A, 5B). As a result of the cell proliferation along the longitudinal axis of anther locules, the oblong locules were filled with archesporial cells in 3-5 mm floral buds (Fig. 5C). Cell division in anther primordia was almost finished at the 7-mm floral bud stage, with 0.6% mitotic index of the archesporial cells (Fig. 5D). In 10-mm floral buds, tapetum cells surrounded PMCs, and no mitotic divisions were observed (data not shown). In the 32-mm floral buds of 'Yelloween' undergoing meiotic division, untreated control microspore tetrads had 20-29 \u00b5m (25 \u00b1 1.8 \u00b5m) diameters, whereas floral buds treated with N 2 O had some larger microspore tetrads with 19-41 \u00b5m (29 \u00b1 4.2 \u00b5m) diameters (Fig. 6). Among them, 29% were >30 \u00b5m in diameter, which was similar to the recovery percentage of fertile pollen at anthesis. These results suggest that N 2 O treatment overcame hybrid sterility in the interspecific hybrid lilies owing to chromosome doubling of archesporial cells of PMCs. Fig. 4.

In the 4xlevel control cross (between 4x Asiatic hybrid lilies 'Gran Paradiso' and 'Loreto'), normal seeds were obtained with 34 seeds per capsule. The ploidy levels of embryos excised from the resulting seeds were determined using flow cytometry (Table 2). All seeds obtained from the 2x \u00d7 2x and 4x \u00d7 4x crosses were diploid and tetraploid, respectively. These data indicate that the diploids and tetraploids used have normal fertility in male and female gametes. Nevertheless, no seeds were obtained in the interploidy cross between the tetraploid 'Gran Paradiso' and the diploid 'Regata', owing to triploid block. This phenomenon can act as a selective barrier against triploids in crosses of tetraploid cultivars with mixed n and 2n pollen (Akutsu et al. 2007). In such crosses, the resulting progeny seeds will be tetraploids. In fact, when the tetraploid cultivar 'Gran Paradiso' was crossed with 2n grain including pollen from N 2 O-treated plants of the diploid cultivar 'Regata', 59% of the flowers pollinated set capsule and the resulting embryos were tetraploid. In the crosses using the 2n grain including pollen from N 2 O-treated 3x LA hybrid 'Royal Torinity', the examined embryos were pentaploid. When L. \u00d7 formolongi was pollinated with pollen obtained from the N 2 O-treated 'Yelloween' (OT hybrid) and 'Otome no Sugata' (LO hybrid), some hybrid embryos were obtained. These were diploid, triploid or tetraploid (Table 3). However, no embryos were obtained using the control pollen that contained no viable grains.",

Furthermore, if fertile pollen was produced in sterile hybrid lilies through the FDR mechanism, the resulting meiotic products should be dyads (unreduced microspores) having the same size as tetrads. In our study, however, larger microspore tetrads were observed in plants treated with N 2 O. Therefore, our results suggest that the FDR mechanism is not involved in restoration of pollen fertility, and chromosome doubling in archesporial cells followed by formation of amphidiploid PMCs (2n = 4x) is the mechanism for the recovery of hybrid fertility. Kato (2002) obtained doubled haploid lines by treating haploid maize floral primordia with N 2 O, suggesting that applying N 2 O to the floral primordial stage might overcome hybrid sterility. Unlike the treatment of floral primordia by Kato (2002), we treated anther archesporial cells. Thus, the use of floral tissues at different developmental stages may overcome interspecific sterility through mitotic polyploidization.",

This may be due to incomplete synchronized mitotic division of archesporial cells in the different anthers within a flower. Nevertheless, the developmental stages of archesporial cells correlated to some extent with floral bud lengths. As a result, the measurement of floral bud length could be used to determine the optimal timing for N 2 O treatment: 1-4 mm for Asiatic hybrid lilies; 2-6 mm for Oriental hybrid lilies and LA hybrid lilies; and 1-4 mm for completely sterile OT hybrid 'Yelloween' and LO hybrid 'Otome no Sugata'. This sizebased criterion is not absolute because the developmental stages of floral buds and archesporial cells are affected by environmental and/or culture conditions. Treatment using smaller floral buds tended to produce greater numbers of giant pollen grains. This indicates that if some archesporial cells undergo chromosome doubling at an early developmental stage with N 2 O treatment, the resulting 4x archesporial cells could predominate, with preferential cell proliferation of the archesporial cell lineage. Additionally, in contrast to the colchicine-induced chimeric somatic tissues where 2x cells proliferate better than 4x cells, the N 2 Oinduced 4x archesporial cells effectively proliferated along the oblong anther locules (Fig. 5) because this narrow oblong locule allowed a certain space for 4x archesporial cells to outcompete 2x archesporial cells with 2n ploidy levels.",

In the present study, N 2 O treatment at the archesporial cell proliferating stage allowed mitotic diploidization of male gametes of fertile cultivars. Thus, to obtain 2n pollen in fertile cultivars, chromosome doubling by N 2 O treatment has two optimal stages-the meiotic division stage and the archesporial cell proliferating stage. N 2 O treatment during the short duration of meiotic metaphase I stage requires skillful techniques for optimizing timing during meiotic divisions. However, it can produce more 2n pollen than in the archesporial cell proliferating stage because PMCs at meiotic metaphase I have more synchronized cell divisions at the time of N 2 O treatment than archesporial cells. On the other hand, treatment is easier at the archesporial cell proliferating stage because plants in premeiotic stage are smaller and easier to handle. Moreover, the duration applicable for N 2 O treatment at the archesporial cell proliferating stage is longer than for the meiotic stage.",

This result is consistent with previous studies by Barba-Gonzalez et al. (2004) and Lim et al. (2000), who reported that fewer chromosomal recombinations occur in progenies obtained from crosses using fertile pollen of amphidiploids restored by somatic chromosome doubling compared to crosses using fertile pollen obtained from meiotic polyploidization. In this study, we found some phenotypic variations in the BC 1 progeny, such as in the flower direction, an important trait for lily breeding (Fig. 7E-7H). This probably resulted from genetic variation between the parental plants of L. \u00d7 formolongi because chromosome recombinations which would be a potential source of phenotypic variation in the progeny did not occur between the genomes of L. \u00d7 formolongi and L. rubellum.",

The selection of 2n gamete producers has contributed to overcoming hybrid sterility in crop breeding (Hanneman and Peloquin 1968, Khan et al. 2009, Marasek et al. 2006, Ramanna et al. 2003. The diploid LA hybrid lilies derived from the cross of L. longiflorum and Asiatic hybrid lilies showed intermediate morphology between the parental species. This intermediate morphology is esthetically undesirable. To improve this undesirable trait, 2n gamete producers were selected for further backcrossing of diploid LA hybrids with Asiatic hybrid lilies because diploid LA hybrids were basically pollen sterile. As a result, triploid LA hybrids have been developed for commercial distribution. Similarly, other hybrid lilies such as OT, OA and LO have been derived from more remote interspecific hybridization than LA hybrids, and hence, they have serious hybrid sterility problems that require breeding involving selection of 2n gamete producers. However, 2n gametes may not be widely applicable in breeding because their occurrence is not always predictable (Asano 1984, Barba-Gonzalez et al. 2004, Lim et al. 2001. Thus, techniques that can overcome hybrid sterility of lilies and perhaps other crops are eagerly awaited. N 2 O treatment would be a useful technique in this regard, and the procedure presented here will promote interspecific or interploidy hybridization of lilies and other crops.",
