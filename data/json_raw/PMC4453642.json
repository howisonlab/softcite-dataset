            "text": "Background: Controversy exists on whether urinary tract infection (UTI) is a risk factor for urinary bladder cancer (UBC). Here, the association is investigated using data from one of the largest bladder cancer case-control studies worldwide. Methods: Information on (i) history and age at onset of regular cystitis ('regular low-UTI') and (ii) number and age at onset of UTI treated with antibiotics ('UTI-ab') from 1809 UBC patients and 4370 controls was analysed. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for age, education, smoking, and use of aspirin/ibuprofen were generated, for men and women separately. Results: Regular low-UTI was associated with an increased UBC risk (men: OR (95% CI) 6.6 (4.2-11); women: 2.7 (2.0-3.5)), with stronger effects in muscle-invasive UBC. Statistically significant decreased risks (ORs B0.65) were observed for up to five UTI-ab, specifically in those who (had) smoked and experienced UTI-ab at a younger age. In women, UTI experienced after menopause was associated with a higher UBC risk, irrespective of the number of episodes. Conclusions: Regular cystitis is positively associated with UBC risk. In contrast, a limited number of episodes of UTI treated with antibiotics is associated with decreased UBC risk, but not in never-smokers and postmenopausal women. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) refer to the presence of microbial pathogens in the urethra or bladder (lower urinary tract), or ureter and pelvis of the kidney (upper urinary tract). In men, the prostate may be involved as well. UTIs are among the most prevalent infectious diseases with varying frequencies among sexes and age categories. About 80% of UTIs occur in women; it is estimated that 40-50% of females experience at least one symptomatic UTI and that half of them will experience a recurrence within 1 year (Foxman, 2010; Salvatore et al, 2011). The majority of UTIs is caused by E. coli and manifests as cystitis. Risk factors for (recurrent) UTI include obstruction of the urinary tract, use of a bladder catheter, a suppressed immune system, oestrogen deficiency, a genetic predisposition, and sexual intercourse, and may differ between men and pre-and postmenopausal women (Foxman et al, 2000; Nicolle, 2002; Foxman, 2010; Salvatore et al, 2011). There is strong evidence linking infection of the bladder by Schistosoma haematobium, endemic in certain low-and middle",

However, whether common, recurrent UTIs are involved in the aetiology of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder remains unclear. Several epidemiological studies, most from the second half of the twentieth century and conducted in small populations, have investigated the association between episodes of (lower) UTI and the risk of urinary bladder cancer (UBC). The majority of these studies report increased UBC risks for any vs no UTI, in both men and women (Wynder et al, 1963;Dunham et al, 1968;Howe et al, 1980;Kantor et al, 1984;Claude et al, 1986;La Vecchia et al, 1991;Kunze et al, 1992;Sturgeon et al, 1994;Jhamb et al 2007;Sun et al, 2013), whereas some do not support a positive association (Piper et al, 1986;Kjaer et al, 1989;Gonz\u00e1lez et al, 1991;Jiang et al, 2009). A few studies specifically address the number of UTI episodes or the duration between UTI and UBC diagnosis, the latter to prevent potential misclassification. Overall, positive associations tend to weaken as the time lag between UTI and UBC increases (Gonz\u00e1lez et al, 1991;La Vecchia et al, 1991;Sun et al, 2013) and the number of UTIs decreases (Kantor et al, 1984;La Vecchia et al, 1991). In contrast to these findings, Jhamb et al (2007) and Jiang et al (2009) report a decreased risk of UBC with an increasing number of kidney and bladder infections with the lowest risk for more than three episodes of infection.",

            "text": "We analysed data on regular cystitis and the number of UTI treated with antibiotics. These two variables are both measures of recurrent UTI but do not reflect the exact same information. In addition to differential recall bias or misclassification, disparity between results for regular low-UTI and a high number of UTI-ab as observed in our study can be contributed to the distinctions between (i) regular and a high number of episodes, (ii) cystitis and UTIs, and (iii) use and no use of antibiotics. Indeed, disparate risks for bladder and kidney infections have been reported by Jiang et al (2009) and Jhamb et al (2007). Also, inhibition of cell proliferation and anti-cancer effects in transitional cell carcinoma cell lines for two of the most commonly used antibiotics in UTI in Dutch practice (i.e., nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim) have been described (Seay et al, 1996;Kamat and Lamm, 2004). However, as most UTIs manifest as cystitis and are treated with antibiotics, these latter two distinctions may not fully account for the observed disparity in effects. One possible explanation for the fact that regular cystitis associates positively with UBC is the mediating role of nitric oxide (NO). NO is produced during inflammation by the activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and may promote tumour growth and proliferation (Xu et al, 2002;Lin et al, 2003). Indeed, studies have shown that iNOS-specific proteins and ribonucleic acid products are present in urothelial tumours of the bladder but not in control bladder tissue (Swana et al, 1999;Lin et al, 2003). In addition, UTIs are also associated with increased iNOS expression in animal models (Mysorekar et al, 2002;Poljakovic and Persson, 2003) and nitrative DNA damage has been associated with bladder cancer induced by Schistosoma haematobium infection (Ma et al, 2011), suggesting that repeated activation of iNOS and thus NO production in both recurrent UTI episodes and in UBC may be a common pathway involved in urothelial response. One may Regular low-UTI for which the number of years between age of UTI and filling out questionnaire (controls)/age of UBC diagnosis (patients) was equal to or less than 5 years were set to zero. Among those who reported regular low-UTI, age at regular low-UTI was available in 15 (63%) male controls and 96 (71%) male patients and in 266 (75%) female controls and 89 (78%) female patients. c UTI-ab for which the number of years between age of first UTI and filling out questionnaire (controls)/age of UBC diagnosis (patients) was 2-5 years were set to zero. Among those who reported UTI-ab, age at first UTI-ab was available in 243 (75%) male controls and 118 (62%) male patients and in 738 (62%) female controls and 90 (63%) female patients. Abbreviations: UTI \u00bc urinary tract infection; UTI-ab \u00bc urinary tract infection treated with antibiotics. For controls, those UTI-ab episodes that were experienced after the questionnaire on regular low-UTI were omitted as to account for the time lag between the questionnaires on regular low-UTI and UTI-ab. Table 4. Associations between regular bladder infection (regular low-UTI) and UTI-ab and urinary bladder cancer, stratified by stage of bladder cancer, median age at onset of infection, menopausal state at onset infection (i.e., older than 51 years of age or not), and smoking status (never vs ever) Median ages (in years) at onset UTI (with omission UTI o \u00bc 5 years prior to age at UBC diagnosis/questionnaire): regular low-UTI males: 50.0; regular low-UTI females: 25; UTI-ab males: 42.0; UTI-ab females: 24.5 c OR adjusted for age (at diagnosis for patients and at filling out questionnaire for controls), highest education, use of aspirin, pack-years cigarettes, use of ibuprofen/brufen. speculate that the protective effect of a limited number of UTI treated with antibiotics suggests that the beneficial anti-cancer effect of antibiotics as described by Seay et al (1996) and Kamat and Lamm (2004) outweighs the detrimental effects of (sporadic) infection and subsequent NO production. It is, however, unclear whether only a few short courses of antibiotics can decrease bladder cancer risk. Note that the decreased rate of UTI-ab in bladder cancer patients compared with controls was not seen for the few UBC patients in our population with squamous cell and adenocarcinoma but only for urothelial carcinoma (as predominant histology) (data not shown).",

The observed decreased risk of UBC for a limited number of UTI is in line with a recent study from Jiang et al (2009) in which one, two to three, and more than three episodes of cystitis were associated with reduced risk of UBC in women. Unfortunately, those women who experienced more than three episodes were combined in one category, thereby preventing us to evaluate the association for those with a higher number of episodes in more detail. Most studies, however, report a higher UBC risk for a patient-reported positive history of UTI (Wynder et al, 1963;Jhamb et al, 2007).",

These findings support the existence of a diagnostic bias. This is underlined by studies that have described UTI diagnosis as a cause for delay in bladder cancer diagnosis (Henning et al, 2013;Cohn et al, 2014). The results of our study were, however, only marginally affected by omission of infections occurring within 5 years prior to UBC diagnosis.",

            "text": "We showed that our results for UTI-ab were similar for men and women; the increased UBC risk for regular cystitis was higher in men though. However, note that, in contrast to women, regular cystitis is rare among the male population. Further stratified analyses, more or less hampered by limited numbers in specific subcategories, did identify deviating findings in some subgroups. Timing of the onset of UTI was found to be of importance; the protective effect of a small number of UTI-ab was only found for those UTI that were experienced at a relatively young age (i.e., below the sex-specific median age) and the increase in UBC risk for recurrent cystitis was more pronounced for an older age of UTI-onset. Especially the increased risk of bladder cancer for history of UTI-ab, irrespective of frequency, in postmenopausal women was striking and warrants further research. It is notable that these subgroups that showed stronger increased UBC risk for recurrent cystitis, that is, men, those with UTI onset at an older age, and postmenopausal women, are also more likely to experience a complicated and recurrent (course of) UTI because of the presence of anatomical, functional, or metabolic conditions (e.g., prostatitis, diabetes, vaginal atrophy). Furthermore, the higher UBC risk for regular cystitis was much stronger in muscleinvasive bladder cancer compared with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, in line with Kantor et al (1984) and Sturgeon et al (1994). The protective effect of a small number of UTI-ab was only seen in (former) smokers; we could not confirm the positive interaction between smoking and history of cystitis on UBC risk as reported in earlier studies (Kantor et al, 1984;La Vecchia et al, 1991).",
