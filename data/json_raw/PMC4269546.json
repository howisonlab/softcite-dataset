            "text": "To respond appropriately to objects, we must process visual inputs rapidly and assign them meaning. This involves highly dynamic, interactive neural processes through which information accumulates and cognitive operations are resolved across multiple time scales. However, there is currently no model of object recognition which provides an integrated account of how visual and semantic information emerge over time; therefore, it remains unknown how and when semantic representations are evoked from visual inputs. Here, we test whether a model of individual objects-based on combining the HMax computational model of vision with semantic-feature information-can account for and predict time-varying neural activity recorded with magnetoencephalography. We show that combining HMax and semantic properties provides a better account of neural object representations compared with the HMax alone, both through model fit and classification performance. Our results show that modeling and classifying individual objects is significantly improved by adding semantic-feature information beyond \u223c200 ms. These results provide important insights into the functional properties of visual processing across time.",

            "text": "Object representations in the ventral stream undergo a transition in the first half-second, becoming increasingly finegrained and specific (Sugase et al. 1999;Hochstein and Ahissar 2002;Hegd\u00e9 2008;Mace et al. 2009;Clarke et al. 2013). This requires highly dynamic and interactive brain mechanisms through which visual information accumulates and cognitive operations are rapidly resolved across multiple time scales, with a continuing interplay between visual and cognitive factors (Humphreys et al. 1988;Humphreys and Forde 2001). However, it is currently unclear when different forms of visual and semantic information emerge across time, and when visual signals contribute to semantic representations. Early models claimed that basic level (e.g., dog) information about objects is available prior to (superordinate) category information (Rosch et al. 1976;Jolicoeur et al. 1984); however, recent evidence has challenged this presupposition in favor of a coarse-to-fine model (Fei-Fei et al. 2007;Mace et al. 2009;Loschky and Larson 2010;Fabre-Thorpe 2011;Pra\u00df et al. 2013). This research suggests that category information is present within the first-pass of neural propagations along the ventral stream (Kirchner and Thorpe 2006;Liu et al. 2009;Chan, Baker et al. 2011), while object-specific, basic-level, semantic information emerges after 150-200 ms supported by recurrent interactions within the stream (Martinovic et al. 2008;Schendan and Maher 2009;Clarke et al. 2011Clarke et al. , 2013. Thus, information sufficient for categorical (e.g., \"tool\") and object-specific (e.g., \"hammer\") dissociations seem to be differentially represented over time.",

Multiple linear regressions are used to 1) ask how well our model fits MEG signals over time, and 2) test whether the mapping between the MEG signals and visual and semantic measures can predict MEG signals for novel items using a leave-two-out cross-validation approach ( Fig. 1; Mitchell et al. 2008). Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of this model compared with models based only on HMax. The predictive accuracy of different combinations of model parameters was used to reveal how specific forms of visual and semantic information are represented across time and source localization was used to reveal the neural regions primarily supporting these types of information.",

The feature norms contain lists of features associated with a large range of objects (e.g., \"has 4 legs,\" \"has stripes,\" and \"lives in Africa\" are features of a \"zebra\"). As similar concepts have similar features, feature-based models capture categorical structure by virtue of feature overlap, while also capturing the properties of a concept that differentiates it from other concepts of the same semantic category, because each concept is composed of a unique set of features. Based on the feature norms, each object can be represented by a binary vector indicating whether each feature is associated with the object or not. The 302 objects used in this study were associated with 1510 features in total. Modeling semantic content was achieved using a binary concept-feature matrix derived from the property norms. The matrix had dimensions of 302 concepts by 1510 features, with cell values of 1 indicating which features are true for concepts and 0 in all other cells. A principal components analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of this matrix, and the first 6 semantic-feature components were selected based on maximum model classification performance for the time window 100-300 ms using an independent group of participants.",

Where classification accuracy was calculated for individual participants, two-tailed paired-sampled t-tests were used in place of Wilcoxon signed-rank test. All tests were corrected for multiple comparisons across time using FDR with an \u03b1 of 0.05.",

Instead of using the regression weights derived from MEG data averaged over participants (those used for model fit and classification), for source localization, we calculated the regression weights for each participant separately, that were then used as the inputs to the source localization procedure. These individual participant localizations were used to provide more accurate source reconstructions than those that localizing the grand averaged data would have produced. Since the regression weights are obtained using linear equations with standardized predictors, they can be used for source localization (Hauk et al. 2006). MRI images were segmented and spatially normalized to an MNI template brain in Talairach space. A template cortical mesh with 8196 vertices was inverse normalized to the individual's specific MRI space. MEG sensor locations were coregistered to MRI space using the fiducial and digitized head-points obtained during acquisition. The forward model was created using the single shell option to calculate the lead-fields for the sources oriented normal to the cortical surface. The data from both magnetometers and gradiometers were inverted together (Henson et al. 2009) to estimate activity at each cortical source using a minimum norm solution, where the inversion was performed simultaneously for all the regression weights for the epoch \u2212200 to 600 ms. No depth weighting was applied. The estimated cortical activity was averaged across the specified time windows (70-160 and 200-400 ms-see Results) before generating an image in MNI space (absolute regression coefficient values), which was smoothed with a 6-mm FWHM Gaussian smoothing kernel. This produces a cortical representation of the regression weights for each predictor, which were then averaged across participants, and displayed on an inflated cortex using Caret (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/caret/). The color scale used was defined by the maximum absolute regression coefficient over all time windows and conditions with no thresholds applied.",

Finally, adding semantic information into the model significantly increases model fit post 200 ms showing that object-specific semantic information is processed after this time.

To rule out the possibility that the increased classification performance for the HMax + SemFeat model was driven by having a greater number of predictors in the model (number of predictors: HMaxC1-only 12, HMax 18, HMax + SemFeat 24), we ran an additional control analysis where all models had an equal number of predictors [i.e., 12 extra predictors were added to the HMaxC1-only model, and 6 extra were added to the HMax model (3 from C1 and 3 from C2)]. The results replicated those of the original analyses ( Supplementary Fig. 2) and further support the claim that the added semantic information represents a qualitative, rather than quantitative, improvement to modeling neural activity.

As both within-and between-category predictions were successful from 50 ms, the full model (HMax + SemFeat) does not dissociate the timing of categorical and object-specific semantic distinctions. This may be because both types of information are rapidly accessed, or due to the HMax parameters supporting a high degree of classification in early time periods; showing that fine-grained low-and high-level visual information is present and able to dissociate any 2 images (regardless of category). If the latter case is true, this may mask any differences between categorical and fine-grained classification accuracy that is only driven by semantic information. Therefore, we evaluated the HMax and SemFeat components of the model independently. As there is some degree of correlation between the predictors for the HMax and SemFeat models (Supplementary Fig. 1), the classification analysis was performed based on the HMax model first, before being performed using the SemFeat model after removing any variance in the MEG signals that correlated with the HMax model. This was achieved by first running multiple linear regressions against the MEG signals with the HMax model predictors to obtain the residuals, which were then used in the classification analysis based on the SemFeat model predictors. This allows us to determine if the SemFeat model can still classify between-and withincategory objects, even when all the variance that can be accounted for by the HMax model has been removed. Using the HMax model, both within and between-category distinctions were significant from 50 ms (all qs < 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and the onsets for between-and within-category effects were not significantly different (P = 0.98). Again classification accuracies were similar for the initial peak, before accuracy was significantly higher for betweencategory distinctions than within-category distinctions from 150 ms to the end of the analysis window (all qs < 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests; Fig. 4b). For the SemFeat model, between-category classification was significantly better than chance after 110 ms with an initial maximum at 130 ms (q < 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, FDR corrected; maximum 59%; Fig. 4c) while within-category classification only became significant at later time points from 150 to 250 ms, reaching a maximum at 230 ms (all qs < 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; maximum 59%). Furthermore, within-category classifications were significantly better than chance between 330 and 360 ms and again from 400 to 500 ms. Bootstrapping revealed that the onset of successful between-category classification was reliably earlier than successful within-category classification (P = 0.027). Direct comparisons of between-and withincategory accuracies showed that between-category accuracy was significantly higher than within-category accuracy between 120 and 140 ms, and from 200 ms to the end of the analysis window (all qs < 0.05 FDR, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). These analyses indicate that the semantic information reflected in the MEG signals is able to dissociate between members of different categories significantly earlier than dissociations can occur within a category.",

To visualize the neural regions that are most important to object-specific classification, we mapped the regression weights of each model predictor to the cortical surface. To achieve this, source localization was performed for each predictor's regression weights that were calculated for the MEG sensors (Hauk et al. 2006). The absolute cortical regression weights for each type of predictor were averaged to create single maps for HMaxC1, HMaxC2, and semantic information.",

The model including semantic-feature information outperformed the HMax computational model of vision in terms of classification accuracy and in the model fit to the data after 200 ms. This shows that a model of meaningful object representations based on combinations of visual and semantic-feature-based measures provides a better account of underlying object representations than one based on computational models of vision alone. Furthermore, this suggests that models based just on visual information do not sufficiently model meaningful object representations beyond the first \u223c150 ms. This may be expected given the HMax model is only claimed to capture immediate vision based on feedforward processing alone (Serre et al. 2005(Serre et al. , 2007). The HMax model does not reflect any form of more abstract object information not directly related to the visual input, one class of which is semantic information that is required to fully model object representations. This is not to suggest that the feature representations used in our semantic model (e.g., \"has legs,\" \"made of metal\") are literally coded in neural populations, but that the statistical regularities observed across features share some properties with the regularities observed in neural semantic object representations.",

This interpretation is supported by other MEG/EEG studies showing that fine-grained object-specific semantic information emerges beyond 150-200 ms, after which longrange recurrent processes are engaged (involving prefrontal cortex, anterior temporal, and posterior temporal regions) that function to disambiguate the object, enabling semantic individuation and the formation of concept-specific representations (Bar et al. 2006;Schendan and Maher 2009;Clarke et al. 2011Clarke et al. , 2013Scholl et al. 2014).",

Aspects of the anterior temporal lobe are considered key to representing conceptual representations (Tyler et al. 2004(Tyler et al. , 2013Moss et al. 2005;Patterson et al. 2007;Lambon Ralph et al. 2010;Mion et al. 2010;Clarke and Tyler 2014), which is also consistent with intracranial recording data from the human medial temporal lobes showing modality invariant responses to individual concepts from around 300 ms (Quian Quiroga et al. 2007. However, we believe it is unlikely that individual conceptual representations only rely on the anterior temporal lobes, as shown by the localization of the semantic-feature regression coefficients in IT and the region's improved model fit when adding semantic information. Therefore, the anterior temporal lobes may function in cooperation with more posterior temporal regions and is concordant with previous research which shows that interactions between the anterior temporal lobe and the posterior fusiform are crucial for processing fine-grained information about objects (Clarke et al. 2011). This is further supported by evidence showing that, when the anterior temporal lobes are damaged, there is decreased functional activation in the posterior ventral stream during semantic tasks (Mummery et al. 1999) and reduced feedback from anterior to posterior ventral stream regions (Campo et al. 2013). One hypothesis of the putative function of this interaction is the integration of semantic information coded in the posterior temporal lobes, which is driven by conjunctive neurons in the perirhinal cortex that act to bind together complex object information (Miyashita et al. 1996;Moss et al. 2005;Taylor et al. 2006;Mion et al. 2010;Chan, Baker et al. 2011;Clarke et al. 2011;Tyler et al. 2013;Clarke and Tyler 2014). This is not to suggest that semantic information is only represented beyond \u223c200 ms. We also found evidence that early semantic processing can underpin the dissociation of objects from different categories, and was observed significantly earlier than semantic information than can dissociate between members of the same category. This was based on a model including only semantic-feature information, and after any effects accounted for by the HMax model had been removed, and so directly reveals when there is sufficient semantic information captured in MEG data to make different kinds of object dissociations. The purely semantic-feature model showed significant between-category classification after 110 ms (initial maximum was 130 ms) and significant within-category classification from 160 ms (maximum at 210 ms; note the onset latency of within-category effects was 210 ms using the singleparticipant classifications though both analysis show similar time courses and peaks).",

The within-category classification effects we observed were not sustained throughout the epoch, showing intermittent above chance effects. One reason why the significant within-category classifications may not be sustained after the onset could be that our analysis focuses on the aspects of the MEG signal that are time-locked to the onset of the image (the evoked signals). The initial between-category and within-category classification effects will be largely underpinned by the evoked information in the MEG signals. However, if there is information relevant to within-category classifications in the MEG signals that is jittered in time across trials, then our approach will not fully utilize this information, and as a consequence may underperform. Future research into the contribution of evoked and induced frequency-specific oscillations, and the functional relevance of these time windows will be required to fully understand the encoding of specific visual and semantic parameters and how they support behavior.",

The latency and duration of the significant within-category distinctions (150-250 ms) is consistent with research showing increased activity in the ventral stream from 170 to 258 ms for object-specific semantic information compared with general category information (Clarke et al. 2011), and that after \u223c200 ms neural activity begins to correlate with naming latencies (Costa et al. 2009).",

These results are in contrast to claims that basic-level conceptual information is available prior to superordinate category information (Rosch et al. 1976;Jolicoeur et al. 1984), instead supporting a model of object recognition where the initial feedforward responses support coarse, categorical knowledge about objects (Kirchner and Thorpe 2006;Liu et al. 2009;Chan, Baker et al. 2011), while the information required for individual semantic concepts emerges subsequently and depends on recurrent interactions (Schendan and Maher 2009;Clarke et al. 2011Clarke et al. , 2013 and the continued interplay between visual and semantic factors (Humphreys et al. 1988;Humphreys and Forde 2001). This progression of semantic information over time does not necessarily suggest discrete stages of initial category representations and later conceptspecific representations, but instead can be formulated in terms of information emerging and accumulating over time, where different kinds of decisions can be made at different latencies based on the information available in current representations (Mack and Palmeri 2011).",

By training a model which incorporated both visual and semantic measures, we were able to successfully construct neural representations for untrained objects with a high degree of accuracy. As the predicted neural representations were novel concepts, this approach allows us to generalize and construct spatiotemporal neural activations for a potentially limitless set of meaningful objects. However, it is worth noting that some of our analyses are based on MEG signals averaged over participants, and so future analyses can be used to determine to what extent the models fully generalize across participants. Visual object classification studies utilizing time-sensitive methods, such as EEG, intracranial recordings and MEG have successfully shown that different categories of object and word can be classified very rapidly (Liu et al. 2009; Simanova et al. 2010; Chan, Halgren et al. 2011; Murphy et al. 2011). For example, EEG patterns can successfully predict whether an object is an animal or a tool within 200 ms (Simanova et al. 2010), although it is unclear if the basis of classification success is visual or semantic (or both). The regression approach used here is based on specific, theoretically motivated predictors, and the relevance of these predictors governs whether classification accuracy improves or fails. This is in contrast to many decoding classification approaches that seek to find differences between 2 (or more) classes of stimuli, but which do not reveal the underlying basis of that difference (Kriegeskorte 2011;Naselaris et al. 2011). Therefore, the classification approach we have adopted provides important information about the basis on which classification works (also see Sudre et al. 2012 for a related approach).",

Object representations are composed of complex visual and semantic information, both of which are necessary to comprehensively model the processing of such representations. We demonstrate that a visuo-semantic model that includes low and high-level visual properties together with semantic-feature information provides an effective model of the time-varying neural representations of individual objects. Our results are supported by measures of model fit as well as predictive performance in constructing and classifying individual objects, and clearly highlight the need to incorporate complex semantic information about objects to understand how objects are represented and processed in the brain.",
