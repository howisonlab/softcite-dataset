Beside the expected promoters located in front of the coding sequences we found a considerable amount of intragenic promoter-like signals with a putative ability to drive either antisense or alternative transcription and revealed unusual genomic regions with extremely high density of predicted transcription start points (promoter 'islands'), some of which are located in coding sequences. PlatProm scores converted into probability of RNA polymerase binding demonstrated certain correlation with the enzyme retention registered by ChIP-on-chip technique; however, in 'dense' regions the value of correlation coefficient is lower than throughout the entire genome. Experimental verification confirmed the ability of RNA polymerase to interact and form multiple open complexes within promoter 'island' associated with appY, yet transcription efficiency was lower than might be expected. Analysis of expression data revealed the same tendency for other promoter 'islands', thus assuming functional relevance of non-productive RNA polymerase binding. Our data indicate that genomic DNA of E. coli is enriched by numerous unusual promoter-like sites with biological role yet to be understood.",

In this study we tried to understand how predictable the data obtained in silico are and to what extent they correlate with the data obtained in vivo.",

            "text": "The genome-scale mapping of promoter sites has been performed by our pattern recognition software PlatProm (6,7). The same as other protocols operating with position-specific weight matrices, PlatProm has an advantage of predicting transcription start points (TSP) (the main promoter attribute, which is determined experimentally), rather than to define promoter regions as extensive genomic loci (9,10,15,16). Upon scanning PlatProm considers any nucleotide as a probable point of transcription initiation and scores this probability by searching for promoter-specific elements in proper positions. Rather high precision and low rate of false positives made our software suitable for genome scanning, providing a possibility to compare in silico and in vivo data. In the present work, we describe an overall map of TSPs predicted by PlatProm; evaluate the degree of correlation between PlatProm scores and RNAPol-binding efficiency registered by two independent research groups (12,13); focus attention on intragenic TSPs and promoter 'islands' having high density of transcription signals over long distance; and verify capacity of one 'island' to bind RNAPol and initiate RNA synthesis.",

To increase the performance of this approach, we took into account sequence-dependent structural features in the genomic environment of promoter sites (6,7). The final version of PlatProm (7) was refined on 271 experimentally identified non-homologous and non-overlapping s 70 -promoters with a single TSP precisely pointed out by the previous version of our software (6). All sequences were 411-bp long (\u00c0255/+155 according to the start point nominated as 0). Allowed variations of the spacer, and the distance between the TSP and the element -10 were 14-21 and 2-9 bp, respectively. Variable length of the spacer was accounted by the matrix penalizing deviations from the optimal 17 bp in accordance with their frequencies in the training promoter set. The varying distance between element \u00c010 and the TSP, ignored by previously published protocols, was taken into account the same way. Weight matrices corresponding to consensus elements \u00c035 and \u00c010 evaluated hexanucleotides, rather than 25 and 19 bp sequences, accounted by Hertz and Stormo ( Figure 1A and B). They contain 6 \u00c2 4 scores equal to natural logarithms of normalized occurrence frequencies for each nucleotide at each position in preliminarily aligned promoters. Percentage of particular nucleotides in the genome was used for normalization. Sequence preference nearby the TSP previously accounted by a 12 \u00c2 4 weight matrix (17) was scored by the matrix precisely reflecting the distribution of dinucleotides in \u00c01/0. Dinucleotides forming the 'extended \u00c010 element' were accounted the same way. Since frequency coefficients depend on promoter alignment, optimal matrices were generated by the procedure of expectation-maximization.",

All sequences were 411 bp long (\u00c0255/+155 according to real or virtual TSPs). The testing compilation was composed of experimentally characterized s 70 promoters not included in the training set. To increase the size of this set we allowed the presence of promoters ($30%) with multiple TSPs (for instance discussed below dcuA), while homologous or overlapping promoters were excluded. CS1 was composed of 273 coding sequences taken from the fixed position of all convergent genes longer than 700 bp, separated by 50-bp intergenic space, which are not associated with promoter 'islands' (see below) and have 5 0 -ends similarly annotated in U00096 and U00096.2 E. coli gene maps. Sequences were taken so as virtual TSPs were 250 bp far from initiating codon (fall in position 254 inside the gene). This strategy minimizes the probability to pick out functional promoter for alternative transcription or for yet unidentified genes in intergenic regions. Having AT-content (48.3%) very close to that of the whole genome (49.2%) CS1 roughly represents natural sequences, which RNAPol has to bypass. CS2 was composed of 400 random sequences with the same AT-content as in chromosomal DNA. (All compilations are available by request.) Promoters were considered as recognized by PlatProm if experimentally mapped TSP(s) or a neighboring nucleotide (AE2) had score higher than threshold level. Using this criteria and the last version of PlatProm we identified 85.5% of promoters from the test compilation at zero level of false positives (level 1, Figure 1) in both CSs (S max = 3.4). Thus, at this level the combination of sensitivity (percentage of recognized promoters = 85.5%) and specificity (percentage of unrecognized non-promoter sequences = 100%) of PlatProm was better than that of previously suggested algorithms (68.7-82% and 82.2-99.1%, respectively) [ (2,15,24) and Figure 1C]. Approximately 80% of recognized promoters possess experimentally mapped TSPs coinciding (in the range of AE 2 bp) with positions of local S maxima, i.e. nearly 70% of natural TSPs are accurately predicted by our software, which is also better than previously reported (<50%) (1,17).",

Figure 1B) and increased sensitivity of the program ( Figure 1C and D) for the whole testing compilation and positively regulated promoters. All additional elements improve the resolution but the largest contribution is given by w-tracts increasing sensitivity for 27.6% ( Figure 1B). This high significance of additional elements provides a chance to detect regulatory regions in newly sequenced genomes if information about their own promoters is insufficient. Figure 2 exemplifies promoters accurately recognized (fadB) and unrecognized (dcuA) by PlatProm. The start point of fadB-transcription exactly fits the experimentally mapped TSP ( Figure 2B), while the original program (17) suggests intragenic P1 as a dominant transcription signal ( Figure 2A Unrecognized promoter P dcuA ( Figure 2D-F) has four TSPs, experimentally mapped 69-72 bp upstream of the initiating codon (28). S values at these positions vary in the range \u00c02.1/\u00c05.7, i.e. far below the level required for recognition. All promoter-specific elements in P dcuA are weakly pronounced, thus no refinement of the current scoring system can compensate for these negative values. Although it can not be excluded that P dcuA has some important determinants, which are not formalized by PlatProm, limitations of experimental mapping performed by primer extension (28) also may result in some difference between apparent and actual TSPs. Reverse transcriptase, for example, can stop at sites with stable hairpins in mRNA structure. In this case, the registered site of transcription initiation would be pointed out downstream from the real one. PlatProm predicts a good candidate (P2) perfectly fitting the RNAPol-binding site registered by ChIP-on-chip assay ( Figure 2F). Thus, comparing in silico and in vivo data one should take into account finite sensitivity and selectivity of computer model as well as limited accuracy of experimental approaches. Even though PlatProm may be further improved on the basis of additional features, current version predicts TSPs with rather high accuracy and was used to depict the genome-wide distribution of potentially transcribed regions.",

Predicted TSPs were searched in the central part of intergenic space (!250 bp from the ends of flanking genes) so as to ensure that only non-coding sequences undergo scoring. Only 15 regions between convergent genes are longer than 500 bp but two of them overlap with promoter 'islands' (see below) and were eliminated. The total length of the remaining ones is 10 226 bp (both strands). As expected, AT-content of these regions is slightly higher (49.2%) than that of CS1 (48.3%). Altogether they contain four predicted TSPs (one per $2500 bp). If all of them are spurious, the probability to come across a false positive is 0.00039, i.e. higher than p-values mentioned above. However, two predicted TSPs are perfectly suitable for small regulatory RNAs HB_48 and HB_139 predicted by Carter et al. (29) and one is located in front of IS yi21_6. Supposing that they belong to real promoters, false positive rate given by statistic analysis and scanning procedure correspond to each other. Even if p = 0.00039 is taken as a real frequency of false signals, still $90% of TSPs predicted by PlatProm should be considered as promoter-like signals deserving more detailed analysis.",

Should they be considered as false positives or not? To address this question we compared distribution of scores in positions surrounding real (test compilation) and virtual (CS1) transcription starts ( Figure 1E-G). An average S quantified for CS1 remains almost constant if the size of analyzed area increases. The number of signals exceeding 'level 1' in AE 2 and AE 5 bp area (11 and 24, respectively) corresponds to the expected values (11 and 26, respectively) if CS2 statistic is used but is twice larger than expected from p-value (<0.0038) calculated on the basis of CS1 scores (6 and 12). The rate of false positives given by CS2 statistic is, therefore, quite realistic. It assumes 0.63 probability for the presence of highly scoring position in the AE 10 area around virtual TSPs of CS1 (total number of positions is 5733). One signal with S >7.44 ('level 2') was really registered in this region ( Figure 1G).",

Only in AE10 region S-values show noticeable divergence. That means that PlatProm scores around real TSPs are higher than background values. Thus, the total number of positions with S >3.4 for AE2 bp area (1681 points) is significantly larger (852) than the total number of experimentally mapped starts including multiple ones (480). Detailed examination showed that $92% of additional signals are generated by PlatProm using the same frame for \u00c035 and \u00c010 hexanucleotides as position with maximal S. Remaining ones correspond to alternative \u00c010 element (4.4%) or \u00c010 and \u00c035 elements (3.6%), suggesting the presence of overlapping promoter. Promoters with multiple TSPs tend to have additional signals corresponding to alternative pair of core elements.

Antisense RNAs, if initiated therein, may block translation by base pairing with mRNAs, regulate their stability or interfere in other molecular processes. Such RNAs control expression of many plasmid and transposon genes, but until now they were not considered typical for bacterial regulatory networks. Nonetheless several lines of evidence support our predictions: Thus, the first amusing outcome obtained from the genome scanning was a large amount of genes containing promoters with antisense orientation. Unexpected intragenic promoters of another group have sense orientation (Figure 3). About 23% of corresponding TSPs lie <50 bp downstream from the initiating codon. They were not considered as candidates for independent transcription initiation, since corresponding promoter-like regions may participate in polymerase trapping near real promoters (1). Some intragenic promoters may intensify transcription of properly oriented downstream genes. If they are also ignored, there are still $400 potential TSPs with a less comprehensible destination. Some of them may produce RNAs antisense to mRNAs of the convergently oriented downstream genes. Synthesis of shortened mRNAs seems to be the most exotic assumption to date.

Reporter gene expression [ Supplementary 1_GFP; (37)] indicated increased transcription in 17 out of 22 constructions when cognate promoters were replaced by appY regulatory region, thus assuming very high activity of appY promoter. The effect, however, was quite opposite if the appY coding sequence was fused to different promoters. Transcription efficiency of the reporter gene significantly decreased practically for all promoters. Thus, it appears to be that strong interaction with RNAPol and even ability to form open complexes do not necessarily result in efficient RNA synthesis. In the case of appY transcription depends on impediments buried in its coding sequence. Intragenic promoter-like sites certainly may play such a role. Genomic DNA of E. coli, therefore, contains several types of promoter-like sites with poorly understood function.

Since S reflects probability of any single nucleotide in the genome to be a TSP, while ChIP-on-chip method estimates efficiency of RNAPol binding to a particular genomic region represented by 50 nt probes on high-density tiled microarrays, the pattern of S should be converted into a comparable mode. Converting procedure should take into account that the geometrical center of RNAPol-binding site does not coincide with the TSP. Moreover, as RNAPol in vivo interacts with double-stranded DNA, samples prepared for chiphybridization contained both strands of enzyme-trapped fragments. Thus, fluorescent signal registered for a particular probe may result from two types of complexes differing in enzyme orientation ( Figure 4A). Supposing each 50 nt probe as a target for interaction with polymerase we thus considered the sum of S corresponding to the virtual TSPs on both strands as a probability of enzyme binding (P):",

Although the data obtained in silico and in vivo reflect the same phenomena: anticipated and registered interaction with RNAPol, there are some peculiarities decreasing evaluated correlation. PlatProm, for instance, accounts putative modules for interaction with regulatory proteins as positive elements, though repressors decrease polymerase binding. Many weak RNAPol-binding sites are not detected in vivo due to low signal-to-noise ratio (12) but PlatProm discriminates them. Intensity of ChIP signals from some promoters may disproportionately decrease due to possibility of epitope occlusion by other interactions (12). Finally, PlatProm is currently attuned to s 70 -specific promoters, while s 70 -specific antibodies precipitate s 28 as well (13). Usage of b 0 -specific antibodies in combination with rifampicin-chase selection allows promoters of all types to be extracted. Considering all these realities, we conclude that both values of R are rather high.",

This phenomenon can not be also explained by repressor functioning since the percentage of probes representing genes with inhibited transcription (22%) among these outlying probes approximately equals the percentage (25%) of such genes in the genome [RegulonDB 5.5 (38)]. Further analysis showed that almost all out-of-ordered probes correspond to regions with multiple promoter-like sites and every one of 78 promoter 'islands' turned out to be represented in the prominent part of Figure 6A. They comprise 32% of all the deviating probes, rather than 0.7% expected by chance. R H and R R for promoter 'islands' are low: 0.09 and 0.17, respectively. Thus, it appears that polymerase recognizes any single promoter-like site within the region of multiple competing promoters with less predictable efficiency than across the whole genome.

Only 21 promoters from this set contribute to the population of 2106 outlying probes by 42 representatives, which is exactly as much as expected by chance ($2%). The set of 'normal' promoters was compared with 78 PIs in terms of RNAPol binding and transcription efficiency calculated as described in Figure 6 legend (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 6C). All PIs and 87% of 'normal' promoters (Supplementary  Tables 2 and 3) form complexes with RNAPol. At the same time RNA synthesis has been detected for 107 'normal' promoters (59%) but only for 20 out of 156 (78 \u00c2 2) genomic loci flanking promoter 'islands' (13%).  Since blue outliers in the second data set tend to fit better to the expected range of log 2 ratios, this slight deviation was not considered as regular and was not further analyzed.

In the case of genes encoding proteins, rRNAs and tRNAs, which by itself are accurately identified by almost perfectly attuned computer programs, promoter-finders may assist in localization of regulatory regions. In the case of genes encoding small untranslated RNAs they are used to point out positions where sRNAs may be initiated (29,39), whereas other programs classify potential products as putative sRNAs based on their thermodynamic features and folding propensity. In the case of aRNAs promoter-finders may provide unique indicators of potential antisense transcription. So far only two dozens of aRNAs at least partly synthesized from the antisense strands of other genes have been found in E. coli. This rather small number apparently does not reflect their multiplicity, as genome-wide expression studies registered a huge amount of RNAs generated from antisense strands (30); PlatProm predicted many potential promoters for antisense transcription, while ChIP-on-chip technique detected suitable intragenic RNAPol-binding sites (12,13). Even though many signals registered by microarrays may result from run-through transcripts unterminated at 3 0 -ends of neighboring genes, some promoters predicted in silico may be false positives while intragenic RNAPol-binding sites may represent paused elongation complexes, combined data vote for antisense transcription in bacteria.",

Our data show that RNAPol can interact with PI1 and initiate RNA synthesis in both directions in vitro but primer extension ( Figure 5E) failed to reveal the presence of appY-mRNA among RNAs produced in vivo. This transcriptional silence makes the value of R between promoter scores within PIs and corresponding (log 2 ) E statistically insignificant, whereas faint correlation between these parameters was registered for the subset of 'normal' promoters (0.16) and even the whole set of predicted promoter-like regions (0.075). That means that the overall transcription from multiple TSPs does not represent the sum of expected outputs from individual ones. Some sites seem to bind RNAPol without initiating productive synthesis, thus performing only part of functions commonly ascribed to promoter regions. If so, they may be considered as a kind of suppressor elements.",

Ninety-two percent of E. coli genes have promoters surrounded by other promoter-like signals (36). This clustering, thus, should be considered as a feature typical for E. coli genes, while 'single' promoters should be ranked as a peculiarity. At the same time only 78 regions have extremely high density of potential TSPs assuming their special role in genome organization and function. Since DNA of all but three PIs has high potentiality to undergo stress-induced deformations [(10); http://www .genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/benham/sidd_database/], there is a reason to suggest a possibility that PIs participate in structural remodeling of bacterial chromosome.",
