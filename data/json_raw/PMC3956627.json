            "text": "Currently, synthetic hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HANPs) are used in nanomedicine fields. The delivery of nanomedicine to the bloodstream exposes the cardiovascular system to a potential threat. However, the possible adverse cardiovascular effects of HANPs remain unclear. Current observations using coculture models of endothelial cells and monocytes with HANPs to mimic the complex physiological functionality of the vascular system demonstrate that monocytes could play an important role in the mechanisms of endothelium dysfunction induced by the exposure to HANPs. Our transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that both monocytes and endothelial cells could take up HANPs. Moreover, our findings demonstrated that at a subcytotoxic dose, HANPs alone did not cause direct endothelial cell injury, but they did induce an indirect activation of endothelial cells, resulting in increased interleukin-6 production and elevated adhesion molecule expression after coculture with monocytes. The potential proinflammatory effect of HANPs is largely mediated by the release of soluble factors from the activated monocytes, leading to an inflammatory response of the endothelium, which is possibly dependent on p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nuclear factorkappa B signaling activation. The use of in vitro monocyte-endothelial cell coculture models for the biocompatibility assessment of HANPs could reveal their potential proinflammatory effects on endothelial cells, suggesting that exposure to HANPs possibly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.",

            "text": "Synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) (Ca 10 [PO 4 ] 6 [OH] 2 ), a typical bioceramic with good osteoconductive and osteoinductive capabilities, has been used clinically for many years. 1 Currently, nanotechnology has entered the field of biomaterials, resulting in the rapid development of nano-based HA. Due to their better bioactivity, their excellent capacity to penetrate cell membranes, and their increased circulation time, HA nanoparticles (HANPs) have gradually garnered significant interest in various medical fields, such as bone tissue engineering, cardiovascular graft coating, contrast agent synthesis, drug delivery, and gene therapy. [2][3][4][5] In these cases of therapeutic and diagnostic application, HANPs may become systemically available, which increases the risk of their exposure to the blood vessels. It has been proposed that atherosclerotic complications may occur with the continued use of HANPs. 3,6 Thus, in terms of human health, the main potential adverse effect of HANPs on the cardiovascular system needs to be carefully assessed before reaching the clinical application stage.",

            "text": "It is well known that synthetic nanoparticles (NPs) can enter the vascular system intentionally by injection in the form of nanomedicines or nanodiagnostics. 7 Accordingly, endothelial cells (ECs), which form the inner cellular lining of the entire cardiovascular system, have direct contact with these NPs. In addition to ECs, NPs may simultaneously encounter circulating immune cells upon introduction into the blood circulation. Monocytes/macrophages are the body's first line of defense and are recognized as important contributors to atherosclerosis via interactions with ECs. Thus, considering the fundamental role exerted by both ECs and monocytes in cardiovascular events, to understand the interaction of monocytes and ECs, both with each other and with NPs, it is very important to assess NP-induced cardiovascular effects. In recent years, several toxicology studies have demonstrated that diesel particulates can indirectly activate ECs via exposure to macrophages, with even more profound effects than those generated by direct exposure to ECs. [8][9][10] Our current studies also found that silica NPs could significantly augment proinflammatory and procoagulant responses in ECs through monocyte-EC interactions. 11 However, to the best of our knowledge, most studies are still focused on the direct biological response of engineered HANPs to monocultures of cells in the endothelium or the immune system; 5,[12][13][14][15][16][17][18] as such, the coculture of monocytes and ECs with HANPs has received little attention in this regard.",

First, HANPs were synthesized, and their physiochemical characteristics were studied. Subsequently, HANP biocompatibility was assessed at the level of specific features, including cell viability, cellular uptake, cytokine production, and cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression in HUVECs and THP-1 cells in monoculture and in HUVECs/THP-1 cells cocultured with HANPs. Moreover, the proinflammatory effects of HANPs on ECs were compared following their exposure to direct contact with the coculture, and after exposure to monocytederived soluble factors. Finally, to investigate the signaling pathway activated by HANPs in ECs cocultured with THP-1 cells, we measured the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in HUVECs.",

A voluminous precipitate was formed. The reaction mixture was gently boiled for 10 minutes. The precipitate was allowed to settle, and it was subsequently separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The HA precipitate was washed with distilled water, frozen at \u221220\u00b0C, and lyophilized. The size and shape of the HANPs were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The structure of HANPs was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a RINT2000 vertical goniometer (Rigaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The powder was examined with Ni filtered CuK\u03b1 radiation generated at 40 kV and 100 mA. The powders were scanned from 10\u00b0-80\u00b0 2\u03b8 with a scan speed of 2\u00b0 per minute. The peak of the obtained XRD pattern was compared with standard HA in the Joint Committee on Power Diffraction Standards file available in software (No 09-0432). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy can be used to find the chemical composition of materials. Thus, for the elemental analysis, a Hitachi S-2600N-type scanning electron microscope (Hitachi Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray attachment (EDAX Inc., Mahwah, NJ, USA) to create element composition spectra. The hydrodynamic size and surface charge (zeta potential) of the HANP dispersions were characterized using the Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) utilizing dynamic light scattering and electrophoretic light scattering, respectively. The specific surface area of the HANPs was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method using a surface area analyzer (ASAP 2020; Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, GA, USA) after pre-preparation of samples by heating at 200\u00b0C in a stream of N 2 in excess of 24 hours.",

TEM analyses revealed that the HANPs were near spherical, or they exhibited slightly elongated shapes (an average of 15 nm in diameter). The size and morphology of HANPs are illustrated in Figure 1A and B. The XRD pattern of the HANPs showed that the structure of the prepared sample was similar to that of the HA standard, as shown in Figure 1C. Our data of the HANPs are highly consistent with the standard HA database (powder diffraction file no 09-0432), indicating that the chief inorganic phase of our synthetic NPs is an HA crystal. Furthermore, our energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data show that the Ca/P ratio in our samples is close to 1.67 which is similar to the theoretical value in HA, suggesting our synthetic HAP is of high purity ( Figure 1D). Surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter are two important properties of NP dispersions in aqueous systems. For the remainder of the study, NPs were characterized in complete cell culture medium (1:1 mixture of EC medium and RPMI 1640 medium). The hydrodynamic size of the NPs, as measured by dynamic light scattering, was approximately 248 nm, revealing that the NPs were well dispersed in the cell culture medium ( Table 1). The zeta-potential of the NPs was determined and displayed a positive potential (\u22128.89 mV) in cell culture medium, indicating that the NPs presented a negative surface charge. Additionally, to examine the surface property of the HANPs, we estimated the Brunauer-Emmett-Tellerspecific surface area. As shown in Table 1, the specific surface area of our prepared HANPs was 109 m 2 /g, which was significantly larger than the commercial HANPs measured by other researchers (7.4 m 2 /g), 15 indicating that the HANPs have a higher biological reactivity.

According to our findings, at a subcytotoxic dose, direct HANP exposure did not cause EC injury, but when cocultured with THP-1 cells, we observed a significant inflammatory activation of HUVECs. This process is possibly dependent on the action of monocyte-derived soluble factors via p38/JNK MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation. Thus, in the present study, we observed a series of cellular and molecular interactions initiated by HANPs between monocytes and ECs that resulted in an inflammatory cascade through a complex network of pathways.",

ECs and monocytes were selected because NPs intravenously administered into the systemic circulation are the most common route of exposure to nanomedicine. At concentrations of 200 \u00b5g/mL and greater, HANPs became cytotoxic in both cell types (Figure 2). Exposure to a subcytotoxic dose can help identify potential health effects of NPs other than those due to cytotoxicity; 25 thus, we chose to work with a lower particle concentration in the following studies (100 \u00b5g/mL). Under these conditions, neither cell type exhibited dramatic cell death after a 24-hour treatment with NPs. Given that it has been demonstrated that the cellular uptake of NPs plays a pivotal role in the alteration of various cellular functions, such as cell viability and the inflammatory response, 26  for 24 hours (Figure 3). In both cell lines, the HANPs were tightly packed and largely confined to spherical vesicles resembling lysosomes within the cytoplasm. Importantly, after HANP uptake, HUVECs did not display a change of morphology ( Figure 3C-D). In contrast, a prominent change in THP-1 cells was observed, which included increased phagocytic activity, as demonstrated by large vacuoles and multiple pseudopodia of the plasma membrane, suggesting the potential immune activation of these particular cells ( Figure 3G-H). Cytokines are important regulators of immune, inflammatory, and vascular reactions, and they play critical roles in cardiovascular disease. 27 Among these cytokines, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 are generally markers of monocyte activation. Moreover, IL-6 is clinically considered a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction and an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. 28,29 As a next step, to further investigate the impact of NP uptake on the cell activation status, we measured the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8 present in HUVECs and THP-1 cell supernatants after direct exposure to HANPs. These experiments demonstrated that increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were released in THP-1 cells after treatment with HANPs ( Figure 4A and B), whereas no proinflammatory cytokines were released in HUVECs alone ( Figure 4C and D).",

            "text": "Since the interaction of the monocytes and ECs that line the blood vessels is a critical process in vascular homeostasis and in pathological conditions of inflammation or thrombosis, the monocyte-EC coculture model is frequently used to assess the biocompatibility of synthetic materials, such as vascular grafts, artificial hearts, and coronary-artery stents for vascular application. [30][31][32][33][34] Recently, some researchers have attempted to use an in vitro coculture model of immune cells and ECs to evaluate the inflammatory potential of nanomaterials, and they found that exposure to these NPs (for example, titanium dioxide [TiO 2 ] or silicone dioxide [SiO 2 ]) in direct-contact cocultures led to dramatically elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. 10,35 Here, we found that the coculture of HUVEC/THP-1 cells resulted in an approximately twofold increase in IL-6 concentrations compared with the individual cell types alone ( Figure 4C). Separating the two cell types and treating HUVECs with conditioned media from HANP-exposed THP-1 cells also significantly increased the release of IL-6, indicating that the induction of IL-6 in HUVECs may be largely dependent on the HANP-activated monocytes ( Figure 4C). Previous studies have reported that noncontact cocultures of ECs and macrophages/monocytes strongly induced more potent inflammatory cytokine release in ECs upon silica particle exposure compared with monocultures alone. 36,37 However, coculture or treatment with the supernatants from HANP-stimulated HUVECs did not increase the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in THP-1 cells when compared with the THP-1 cells directly exposed to HANPs, indicating that the HANP-stimulated ECs were relatively ineffective on monocyte activation ( Figure 4A and B). When undergoing activation, apart from IL-6, ECs also express various CAMs, such as ICAM-1 (CD54), VCAM-1 (CD106), and E-selectins (CD62E). Generally, ICAM-1 is constitutively present in ECs, and its expression is increased by proinflammatory stimuli. 38 VCAM-1 and E-selectin are not routinely expressed under physiologic conditions, but they can be induced in activated endothelium. The expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin is important in the initial steps of monocyte recruitment to atherosclerotic lesions and in the rolling of monocytes on the endothelial surface, whereas ICAM-1 is involved in the firm adhesion step in leukocyte infiltration. 39,40 CAM expression and established markers of endothelial dysfunction have been clinically considered to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors, and they may predict the development of cardiovascular disease. 41 Thus, to further verify the contribution of monocytes in EC activation induced by HANP exposure, CAM expression in HUVECs was measured using flow cytometry. Consistent with proinflammatory cytokine results after exposure to HANPs, cocultures of ECs and monocytes had significantly greater increased levels of VCAM-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression compared with HUVECs cultured alone. vWF is considered to be a classic marker of ECs, because it has been found only in ECs, megakaryocytes, and platelets. 42 Thus, we assessed the THP-1 cells' adhesion to HUVECs by cell-specific surface markers (vWF). Our data showed that the vWF expression of separated HUVECs from the HANP-treated coculture was slightly lower than that of the HUVECs from the untreated coculture (P,0.05), indicating that HANPs may elicit an attachment of monocytes to HUVECs. Additionally, HUVECs incubated with supernatants of HANP-stimulated monocytes expressed levels of VCAM-1, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 that were similar to those generated by the direct-contact coculture system, suggesting that monocyte-derived soluble factors were responsible for the activation of ECs (Figure 5). Among the soluble mediators possibly involved, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which are primarily produced by monocytes and are wellknown inducers of EC activation,were good candidates. 43 Taken together, these results suggest that direct exposure to HANPs could result in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 production in THP-1 cells and that both cytokines, once released, might stimulate IL-6 generation and CAM expression by HUVECs. These results were consistent with those from previous studies that demonstrated that the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 from particle-activated monocytes/macrophages might be the critical determinants for increased synthesis of IL-6 or CAM expression in ECs. 7,9,36 It is a widely accepted view that intracellular MAPK signaling cascades probably play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. 39 To clarify the possible signaling pathway of the proinflammatory effects of HANPs on HUVECs in coculture, we detected the activation levels of JNK, p38, and NF-\u03baB. p38 and JNK belong to the MAPK superfamily and are stress-activated serine/threonine protein kinases with major functions in apoptosis, cytokine production, transcriptional regulation, and inflammation. 44 Various inflammatory cytokines are capable of activating p38 and JNK MAPK, which has been shown to regulate inflammation and induce endothelial dysfunction. 45,46 In addition, NF-\u03baB is also a critical transcription factor involved in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and the expression of CAMs, such as E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. 47,48 Our results clearly demonstrated that HANPs alone could not induce JNK, p38, or NF-\u03baB activation in HUVECs; however, HANP-stimulated cocultures significantly elevated the phosphorylation levels of p38/JNK MAPK and the activity of NF-\u03baB, suggesting that the activation of JNK, p38, and NF-\u03baB in ECs by exposure to HANPs required the involvement of monocytes. It has been demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2 mainly induces proinflammatory cytokine release, such as IL-6 gene expression in HUVECs, which is a p38/JNK-dependent process. 49 However, TNF-\u03b1 more profoundly affected the expression of CAMs via the NF-\u03baB pathway. 49 TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release by HANP-stimulated monocytes may induce p38/JNK MAPK and NF-\u03baB activation in HUVECs, suggesting that HANPs can indirectly induce ECs' inflammatory response by activating monocytes. However, in this study, although we have found that HANPs could directly induce TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 release from monocytes, and that these cytokines released by HANP-stimulated monocytes play a critical role in monocyte-mediated inflammatory activation in HUVECs, we cannot rule out other potential proinflammatory mechanisms of HANP-activated monocytes against HUVECs. The detailed mechanism of this phenomenon needs to be further investigated.",

In addition, although HANPs had no direct effect on endothelial inflammation, we determined that HANPs induced an indirect activation of ECs, resulting in increased IL-6 production and elevated adhesion molecule expression after coculture with monocytes. The potential proinflammatory effect of HANPs is primarily mediated by the release of soluble factors from activated monocytes, which leads to an inflammatory response of the endothelium that is possibly dependent on p38/ JNK MAPK and NF-\u03baB signaling activation. Thus, the use of the in vitro monocyte-EC coculture model on the biocompatibility assessment of HANPs could reveal their potential proinflammatory effects on ECs, suggesting that exposure to HANPs could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
