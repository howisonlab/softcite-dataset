The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine(TCM)in the treatment of glaucoma by meta-analysis based on clinical controlled trial. Methods. All the prospective randomized controlled trialsof surgery combined with TCM in the treatment of glaucoma were searched in the databases of Medline (1960~2015.1), CENTRAL (the Cochrane central register of controlled trials 1989~2015.1, EMBASE (1980~2015.1) and CNKI (1979~2015.1). Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the included studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. The pooled relative risk (RR) or standard mean difference (SMD) of surgery combined with TCM versus western medicine or surgery alone were calculated as the effect size by meta-analysis method. All the data was analyzed by stata11.0 software (http://www.stata.com; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). Results. Finally, eleven clinical controlledtrails with 843 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that the surgery combined with TCM treatment procedure can significant improve the vision recovery rate compared to control group (RR=1.22, 95% CI:1.06~1.40, P=0.005); And after treatment, the visual field in combined group was significantly improved"

            "text": "Glaucoma is a term for a group of eye disorders which result in damage to the optic nerve [1]. Most of the damage to the optic nerve is related to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) [2]. Glaucoma is the most commonly diagnosed eye disease, considered as the leading cause of blindness world-wide [3]. The exact pathogenesis for glaucoma is still not clear. Epidemiological data indicates that glaucoma may be associated with genetic susceptibility, mood swings, fatigue and other factors [4]. The goals of glaucoma management are to avoid nerve damage and preserve visual field and total quality of life for patients with minimal side effects. At present, laser surgery, conventional surgery and medicine are used to treat glaucoma. Recently, several clinical studies reported that clinical efficacy can be improved by surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of glaucoma [5,6]. However, the effectiveness of the combined treatment varied considerably among the published studies with small sample sizes. Accordingly, we performed a meta-analysis on the basis of published clinical trials in order to identify whether the combined treatment was superior to surgery alone.",

Statistical heterogeneity of the results across the included studies was evaluated by Chi-square (\u03c7 2 ) test [8], and the inconsistency was calculated by I2 [9]. If heterogeneity was found (\u03c7 2 , p<0.05 or I2>50%), the random-effect method (Dersimonian-Laird method) was used to pool the data. Otherwise, without significant heterogeneity, fixed-effect method was used. The Egger's tests were performed to evaluate publication bias as described by Egger [10].",

At present, laser surgery, conventional surgery and medicine are commonlyused to treat glaucoma. The effectiveness of these therapies is either limited or associated with significant side effects.    Traditional Chinese medicine has a unique advantage in the treatment of chronic diseases, such as nervous system diseases. TCM believes that \"the wind for glaucoma cataract\" stasis caused by water, which caused the disease. The treatment should be based on supplementing Qi and nourishing Yin [22]. Several clinical studies have reported that it was effective for surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of glaucoma [11][12][13][14]. But the effectiveness of the combined treatment ranged a lot among the published studies with small sample size. Thus, we searched all the published clinical studies reporting the neuroprotective effects of surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of glaucoma. We thenpooled the data by meta-analysis method. The pooled results showed that surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine treatment procedure can significantly improve the vision recovery rate compared to control group (RR=1.33, 95% CI:1.09~1.62, p=0.005). This means that the combined treatment modality was superior to surgery alone for vision recovery. Meta-analysis also found that the visual field in combined group was significantly improved compared to control group (SMD=0.26\uff0c95% CI:0.09~0.43, p=0.003).Therefore, the combined treatment had more advantages in the aspect of neuroprotective effect for patients with glaucoma.",

            "text": "Althoughthis meta-analysis found that surgery combined with traditional Chinese medicine can imporve the vision recovery rate and the visual field in the treatment of glaucoma compared to surgery or western medicine alone, several limitations are found in this study. Firstly, all of the 11 included studies come from China with patient ethincity \"Han\", which could lead to patientselective bias. Secondly, the patient number for each included studies was relative small. Thirdly, the results were pooled by extracted data of the published paper not the individual patient data, which may lead to information bias. Fourth, the treatment period ranged from 2 months to 6 months which can lead to clinical heterogeneity. In view of the above facts,multi-center prospective randomized controlled trialsareneeded for further evaluation of the the neuroprotective effect of surgery combined with traditional chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of glaucoma."
