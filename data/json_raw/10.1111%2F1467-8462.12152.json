Hitherto, an extensive range of organisations has held the data for Australian cities, crossing government, industry and academia. With the growing demand for open data and capabilities to support big data analytics, new opportunities now exist to rectify this situation. The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) project has been funded to provide seamless, secure access to data from definitive organisations of Australia. We describe the AURIN platform; it's data, together with a representative big data case study.",

The urban population was growing at 3.5 per cent per annum during the 2000s and there are now estimated to be 500 urban agglomerations with populations in excess of 1 million people (Garland 2014). It is projected that the number of people living in cities will increase to over 5 billion over the next two decades, with most of that increase being in the developing world (McKinsey Global Institute 2011). There are also projected to be 135 megacities, with populations over 10 million, by the end of 2015 (World Bank 2009). Cities and the populations they comprise are more than just collections of individuals and infrastructure (housing, schools, roads etc) built around them. Depending on how they are planned and developed, cities can play pivotal roles of great societal impact for most of the planet's inhabitants. Poorly designed cities can cause a range of challenges and frustrations to the inhabitants: transport systems, environmental challenges, over-population and challenges of increasing numbers of migrants, socioeconomic challenges stemming from the evolving global economies and associated employment opportunities are just some of the issues that city planners should be aware of in the future growth and form of the urban environments they are ultimately responsible for.",

In developing such an infrastructure, it was essential that the infrastructure developed was flexible, searchable with enriched metadata, scaleable and essentially extensible. Thus, there was/is no fixed set of data providers and datasets, nor a pre-defined set of tools that must be incorporated into this infrastructure. Rather, the system had to be developed to accommodate flexible and streamlined ingestion of new, heteregeneous data from new organisations and include new tools as they arrive. Developing such extensibility demanded that a data-driven approach was taken. Thus, rather than building bespoke solutions to access and use data from particular organisations, generic data-driven solutions were required that work across a multitude of organisations and support a variety of research efforts.",

Many research endeavours in disparate disciplines are now limited by the ability to discover, access and optimally use data. The work on e-infrastructures, allowing seamless access to distributed data resources, has been ongoing for decades: from the original efforts in large-scale data grid efforts, typified by Hey and Trefethen (2003), Shiers (2007) and Per ez-S anchez et al. 2015, to more recent Cloud-based efforts, typified by Amazon. 'Big data' is the current buzz word that captures the nature of the challenge facing many research communities. Cities are extremely diverse with numerous potentially inter-related datasets: health, housing, transport, population demographics amongst many other issues. To tackle this, AURIN focused on a set of key themes (lenses) of particular importance to the urban research community of Australia. Each of these lenses had their own datasets, services and tools that needed to be brought together. The set of AURIN lenses included: population and demographic futures and benchmarked social indicators; economic activity and urban labour markets; urban health, well-being and quality of life; urban housing; urban transport; energy and water supply and consumption; and innovative urban design. These lenses are described in McCafferty et al. (2010). Each of these lenses represented a significant urban research area in its own right. However, each of these is interrelated. Thus, the changing profile of population demographics in cities is essential for planning for urban transport, housing, energy, water use and health care.",

On the one hand, some of these data providers have data that are directly accessible on the Web. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS, <http://www.abs.gov.au>) has over 1 million web pages through which a huge array of past and present Census data can be accessed, as well as an extensive array of surveys and reports related to the Australian population. On the other hand, many other national and statebased agencies do not offer access to their 'data', preferring instead to release data in aggregated forms; for example, as written reports. Being able to access and combine distributed data from multiple independent and autonomous organisations through a unified environment would greatly simplify the life of many urban researchers and allow major urban research challenges to be systematically tackled. Ideally, such a solution would offer live (programmatic) access to in situ remote data resources from the definitive data providers and avoid web scraping or other ad hoc data collection mechanisms that would break when websites and their content change. The solution should provide tools to support collection and enrichment of provider-specific metadata to enable complex data analytics scenarios using this diverse ecosystem of data. The AURIN platform has delivered such an integrated, data-rich research environment. AURIN is not unique in this endeavour and a range of efforts is currently ongoing-albeit on a much more focused domain; for example, with a fixed or known set of data providers.",

Here, we consider the number of children in welfaredependent or low income families (earning less that $20,799), which is available from UA_PHIDU. Combining (merging) the SEIFA dataset and the UA_PHIDU dataset allows for a range of statistical analyses to be undertaken. Through selecting data at the SA2 level, these datasets can be combined directly (utilising the unique codes associated with the SA2s across Australia). Once merged, a range of analyses can be undertaken. Here, we consider a basic linear regression, although we note that the AURIN platform contains over 100 analytical tools that are available for richer geospatial analytics. These tools are outlined in Sinnott and Voorsluys (2015). Figure 5 shows the correlation between the SEIFA IRSAD score and the number of lower income or welfare-dependent families in the SA2s across Australia. It is noted that the AURIN platform enforces intelligent decisionmaking where it can; for example, by checking that the datasets that are joined are at the same geospatial aggregation level (SA2). Outliers in these correlations (for example, areas with low SEIFA scores or areas with large numbers of children in welfare-dependent or low income families) can be seen directly. What is key here is that these are independent datasets from independent organisations that hitherto have not allowed direct comparison. Instead, researchers typically have to source these datasets themselves through ad hoc means and undertake such analysis using a range of tools. A further analysis that might be considered is the SEIFA IRSAD score and the percentage of 16 year olds in secondary college; that is, do we observe more people leaving school earlier in more disadvantaged areas? This dataset is also available from UA_PHIDU. Using the AURIN tools to merge the datasets and analyse the data, we see the correlation shown in Figure 6. The data points in the lower-left portion of the scatter plot represent those SA2s with a low SEIFA IRSAD score and lower school-leaving age. Figure 4 shows that many of the disadvantages arise in areas with increased numbers of Indigenous persons. A further dimension to this analysis is to explore the correlation between the poor health of the Indigenous communities and the SEIFA IRSAD score.",

These datasets were amongst the most widely accessed and used within the AURIN platform.
