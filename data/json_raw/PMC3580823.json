            "text": "The effects of glucose on aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated in this study by using mutants related to aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis and regulation, as well as glucose signalling. The results showed that glucose significantly increased the contents of individual and total aliphatic glucosinolates. Expression of MYB28 and MYB29, two key transcription factors in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, was also induced by glucose. Consistently, the increased accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates and the up-regulated expression of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 induced by glucose disappeared in the double mutant myb28myb29. MYB28 and MYB29 synergistically functioned in the glucose-induced biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates, but MYB28 was predominant over MYB29. Interestingly, the content of total aliphatic glucosinolates and the expression level of MYB28 and MYB29 were substantially reduced in the glucose insensitive mutant gin2-1 and the ABA insensitive 5 (abi5-7) mutant compared with the wild type. In addition, total aliphatic glucosinolates accumulated much less in another sugarinsensitive RGS1 (regulator of G-protein signaling 1) mutant (rgs1-2) than in the wild type. These results suggest that glucose-promoted aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis is regulated by HXK1-and/or RGS1-mediated signalling via transcription factors, MYB28, MYB29, and ABI5.",

            "text": "Glucosinolates are a group of nitrogen-and sulphur-containing secondary metabolites found mainly in Brassicaceae crops. They can be grouped into aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic glucosinolates based on their different side chain structures (Grubb and Abel, 2006;Agerbirk and Olsen, 2012). It is well known that glucosinolates and their degradation products have diverse biological functions that range from anticarcinogenic activities to plant defence against pathogens and herbivores (Fahey et al., 1997;Grubb and Abel, 2006;Yatusevich, 2008;Kos et al., 2012;Saavedra et al., 2012). Aliphatic glucosinolates have been demonstrated to play an important role in plant-herbivore interactions and non-host resistance in the Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas pathosystem (Beekwilder et al., 2008;Fan et al., 2011).",

            "text": "To date, almost all genes involved in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway have been identified (Yan and Chen, 2007;S\u00f8nderby et al., 2010). CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 are two important genes whose products catalyse accumulation of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates, while the product of CYP79F1 also functions in the biosynthesis of short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates (Reintanz et al., 2001;Chen et al., 2003;Tantikanjana et al., 2004). In addition, MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76 have been identified as transcription factors in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis with partial functional redundancy. Among them, MYB28 plays the most important role in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, followed by MYB29 and MYB76 (Hirai et al., 2007;Gigolashvili et al., 2009). Furthermore, many abiotic factors including nitrogen and sulphur nutrients as well as the plant hormones have been reported to affect the profile and content of glucosinolates (Kliebenstein et al., 2002;Mikkelsen et al., 2003;Mewis et al., 2005;Aires et al., 2006;Chen et al., 2006;Falk et al., 2007;Bano, 2010;Chen et al., 2011;Liu et al., 2011).",

They can also act as effective signalling molecules throughout plant life (Rolland et al., 2006;Ramon et al., 2008;Bolouri-Moghaddam et al., 2010;Smeekens et al., 2010). Hexokinase (HXK), the first enzyme involved in glucose catabolism, can sense glucose and initiate the signalling pathway in Arabidopsis (Moore et al., 2003). The network of HXK1-dependent glucose and ABA signalling has been identified, and the ABA-insensitive abi5 mutant is insensitive to glucose (Le\u00f3n and Sheen, 2003;Ramon et al., 2008). Furthermore, it is reported that a regulator of G-protein signalling (AtRGS1) acts as a cell surface receptor and functions in a HXK-independent glucose signalling pathway (Chen and Jones, 2004;Rolland et al., 2006). In previous studies, sugar-regulated plant secondary metabolites were observed in several Brassica vegetables (Guo et al., 2011;Wei et al., 2011). The induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis by sucrose has been clearly illustrated (Teng et al., 2005). Cross-talk between sucrose and hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway has also been reported (Loreti et al., 2008). Apart from the reports showing that glucose induces the expression of MYB28 in Arabidopsis (Li et al., 2006;Gigolashvili et al., 2007), little information is available on the role of glucose in aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation. In this study, the aim was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of glucose on aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, and to identify the components involved in glucose signalling.",

The seeds were stratified for 3 d at 4 \u00b0C, and transferred into flasks (~50 seeds per flask) with 40 ml of liquid growth medium [full-strength sterilized Murashige-Skoog (MS) salt solution+0.5% glucose]. Plants were grown under a photoperiod of 16 h light/8 h dark with gentle shaking (135 rpm) for 10 d in a plant growth chamber at 21 \u00b0C (Loreti et al., 2008). For Supplementary Figs S1 and S3, experiments were carried out with solid culture as follows: surfacesterilized seeds were planted on 0.5% agar plates containing MS salt and 0.5% glucose. In the experiment shown in Supplementary Fig.   S6, MS salt solution was replaced with half-strength sterilized MS salt solution. Seeds were grown in a plant growth chamber under the same conditions mentioned above after being incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 3 d.

Fresh tissues (100 mg) were boiled in 1 ml of water for 10 min. After recovery of the liquid, the residues were washed with water (1 ml), and the combined aqueous extract was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 (30 mg) column (pyridine acetate form). The column was washed three times with 20 mM pyridine acetate and twice with water. The glucosinolates were converted into their desulpho analogues by overnight treatment with 100 \u00b5l of 0.1% (1.4 U) aryl sulphatase, and the desulphoglucosinolates were eluted with 2 \u00d7 0.5 ml of water. The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), consisting of two LC-20AT solvent delivery units, a DGU-20A3 degasser, a CTO-10ASVP column oven, an SIL-20A autosampler, and an SPD-M20A diode array detector. The HPLC system was connected to a computer with LC solution Version 1.25 Software. A Hypersil C18 column (5 \u00b5m particle size, 4.6 mm\u00d7250 mm; Elite Analytical Instruments Co. Ltd, Dalian, China) was used with a mobile phase of acetonitrile and water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min -1 . The procedure employed isocratic elution with 1.5% acetonitrile for the first 5 min; a linear gradient to 20% acetonitrile over the next 15 min; followed by isocratic elution with 20% acetonitrile for the final 13 min. A 20 \u00b5l sample was injected onto the column by an autosampler. Absorbance was detected at 226 nm. Sinigrin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as an internal standard for calculation of molar concentrations of individual glucosinolates, and relative response factors were applied to correct absorbance differences between the standard and other glucosinolates (Brown et al., 2003). Data were given as nmol mg -1 FW (fresh weight).",

Because there exists an interaction between glucose and nitrogen (Price et al., 2004), liquid growth medium including half-strength MS salt solution with 0.5% glucose, which contains a lower nitrogen concentration, was used to confirm the induction of glucose, and strong induction of glucose still can be observed ( Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, the content of total aliphatic glucosinolates was also measured at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 h after glucose treatment to investigate the time-course accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates ( Supplementary Fig. S2). A significant difference in total aliphatic glucosinolates between glucose and sorbitol treatment occurred 24 h after treatment.",

            "text": "Sugars were first recognized to be the prime carbon supply and energy source in plants. However, reports on their regulatory functions have been increasing in recent years (Smeekens et al., 2010). The regulatory mechanism of sucrose in anthocyanin biosynthesis has been well elucidated (Teng et al., 2005). In addition, previous studies indicated that sugars could boost the accumulation of health-promoting compounds in Brassica vegetables (Guo et al., 2011;Wei et al., 2011). As a signalling molecule, glucose controls plant growth, development, metabolism, and stress resistance (Ramon et al., 2008). In the current study, the results indicated that glucose positively regulated aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis. Aliphatic glucosinolates can be greatly induced through MYB transcription factors by glucose in a time-and dose-dependent manner (Figs 1, 4), while aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation was severely disrupted in the glucose signalling mutants gin2-1 and rgs1-2 (Fig. 6A, B). In addition, because glucosinolate contents could be affected by several abiotic stress factors, such as salt, drought, and water (L\u00f3pez-Berenguer et al., 2008;Khan et al., 2010;Yuan et al., 2010), sorbitol was taken as an osmotic stress control and its effect on glucosinolates was not as strong as that of glucose. Moreover, fructose, the isomer of glucose, which can interconvert with glucose and enter the metabolic pathway of glucosinolates with the form of glucose-6-phosphate as intermediate (Henry et al., 1991; Bhagavan and Ha, 2011), could not mimic the induction by glucose of glucosinolate accumulation ( Supplementary Fig.  S4 at JXB online). In addition, the glucose analogue mannose, the substrate of HXK1 phosphorylation, which can also trigger the signalling function of HXK1 (Ramon et al., 2008), did not have a similar induction to glucose ( Supplementary  Fig. S5). To sum up, glucose induces aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation as a signalling molecule in Arabidopsis thaliana through a mechanism different from mannose.",

Samples were collected 3 d after treatment. Each data point represents the mean of three independent biological replicates per treatment (mean \u00b1SE). Values not sharing a common letter are significantly different at P < 0.05. (Gigolashvili et al., 2009). Almost all the biosynthetic genes in the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway can be positively regulated by these two transcription factors (Yan and Chen, 2007). To test whether aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis induced by glucose was due to the up-regulation of MYB transcription factors, qPCR was applied to determine the expression pattern of MYB28 and MYB29 after glucose treatment. As expected, induction of these two genes was similar at different time points except that the expression of MYB28 had an earlier peak than that of MYB29. This exactly reflected that MYB28 could regulate the expression of MYB29 (Yatusevich, 2008)  (Fig. 4A, B). In addition, the expression levels of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2, the key structural genes in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, were also enhanced after glucose treatment (Fig. 4C, D). The induction occurred within the first 6 h, which was a little earlier than glucosinolate enhancement. This indicates that the expression of transcription factors can sense changes in the environment in a shorter time than the production of secondary metabolites. The results are consistent with previous reports on Brassica crops with sucrose treatment (Guo et al., 2011;Wei et al., 2011).",

            "text": "To obtain a deeper understanding of the role that the main transcriptional regulators and structural genes played in the regulation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in response to glucose, three mutants, myb28, myb29, and myb28myb29, were used for further analysis. MYB28 is the predominant transcription factor belonging to the MYB family controlling the profiles of aliphatic glucosinolates, and it is mainly responsible for long-chain and short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates, while MYB29 participates more in short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates. In the present study, myb28 showed a very severe lack of aliphatic glucosinolates compared with myb29 (Hirai et al., 2007;Gigolashvili et al., 2008;Yatusevich, 2008)  (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, the reduction could be recovered by glucose supplementation in myb29 but not in the case of myb28 (Fig. 5A). This is due to the fact that these two transcription factors have functional redundancy in regulation of aliphatic glucosinolate, in which MYB28 takes a master role while MYB29 has an accessory role (Hirai et al., 2007). According to previous reports (Yatusevich, 2008), MYB29 can be induced by MYB28. Thus, when myb29 was treated with glucose, the strong expression of MYB28, induced by glucose, could compensate the decreased level of MYB29 expression (Fig. 5B, C). When MYB28 is knocked out, the expression of MYB29 is still lower than that in Col-0 even under glucose treatment (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, the induction by glucose of total aliphatic glucosinolates and the expression of MYB29 in mutant myb28 were much weaker than that in Col-0. This observation indicated that the strong induction by glucose of the expression of MYB29 in Col-0 is   partly due to the regulation of MYB28 (Fig. 4). These results may explain why myb28 contained a significantly reduced level of aliphatic glucosinolates with or without glucose treatment.",

Interestingly, it contained no detectable aliphatic glucosinolates even when treated with glucose. Previous research has illustrated that CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 could be regulated by MYB factors (MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76) (Gigolashvili et al., 2008). Here the up-regulated expression of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 in Col-0 was not observed in myb28myb29 before and after glucose treatment. These findings suggest that the MYB transcript factors are induced by glucose, and then regulate the expression of structural genes which finally lead to the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolate.",

Relative expression values are given compared with seedlings treated by water. (Ramon et al., 2008) and they carry out diverse and distinct functions in glucose metabolism and signalling. AtHXK1 has been characterized as an intracellular glucose sensor (Bolouri-Moghaddam et al., 2010). HXK1-dependent glucose signalling can affect plant growth, which relies on the endogenous glucose level and the sensitivity to glucose in plants (Ramon et al., 2008). In addition, there are other glucose-sensing and signalling pathways independent of HXK1. It has been reported that the signalling pathway of sugar-induced anthocyanin accumulation is independent of HXK1 (Xiao et al., 2000;Teng et al., 2005). Furthermore, the fructose signalling can function independently of the HXK1 glucose sensor (Li et al., 2011). In A. thaliana, RGS1 is a regulator of G-protein signalling protein, which modulates plant cell proliferation and may serve as a glucose sensor located on the cell surface, independent of HXK1 (Chen and Jones, 2004;Ramon et al., 2008).",

Both mutants are glucose insensitive. According to the present results, gin2-1 and rgs1-2 mutants showed a notable decrease in the level of total aliphatic glucosinolates whether treated with glucose or not, when compared with their corresponding controls (Fig. 6A, B). This suggested that HXK1 and RGS1 might both participate in the regulation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis. It has been reported that HXK1 regulates transcription and proteasome-mediated degradation of the EIN3 (ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3) transcription factor in the nucleus, and several types of transcription factors are involved in sugar-regulated transcription (Rolland et al., 2006;Ramon et al., 2008). Therefore, the gene expression pattern of three MYB transcription factors involved in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76) was analysed in gin2-1 mutants, and a substantial decrease in the expression level in response to glucose was observed when compared with the wild type ( Fig. 6C-E). This is undoubtedly another piece of evidence for HXK1-dependent induction of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis by glucose signalling through MYB factors.",

ABA signalling and sugar sensing share several common components, and many glucose-insensitive mutants are also allelic to ABA biosynthetic or signalling mutants (Finkelstein and Gibson, 2002;Rook et al., 2006). ABI5 (ABA-insensitive 5) encodes a transcription factor belonging to a large basic leucine zipper (bZIP) gene family, conferring on abi5-7 a glucose-insensitive phenotype. ABI5 is therefore a putative glucose signalling component downstream of HXK1 (Ramon et al., 2008;Reeves et al., 2011). In this study, abi5-7 was deficient in total aliphatic glucosinolate content before and after glucose treatment when compared with the wild type, as well as the expression level of MYB transcription factors after glucose treatment (Fig. 7). These results suggested that ABI5 might be involved in the regulation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis as a glucose signalling component downstream of HXK1.",
