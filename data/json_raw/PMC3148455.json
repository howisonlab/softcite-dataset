PATIENTS AND METHODS: TGF-b1 expression levels were analyzed using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to amplify RNA that had been isolated from fresh-frozen malignant and benign tissue specimens collected from 89 patients who had clinically localized prostate cancer and had been treated with radical prostatectomy. The control group consisted of 11 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. The expression levels of TGF-b1 were compared between the groups in terms of Gleason scores, pathological staging, and prostate-specific antigen serum levels. RESULTS: In the majority of the tumor samples, TGF-b1 was underexpressed 67.0% of PCa patients. The same expression pattern was identified in benign tissues of patients with prostate cancer. Although most cases exhibited underexpression of TGF-b1, a higher expression level was found in patients with Gleason scores $7 when compared to patients with Gleason scores ,7 (p = 0.002). Among the 26 cases of TGF-b1 overexpression, 92.3% had poor prognostic features. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-b1 was underexpressed in prostate cancers; however, higher expression was observed in tumors with higher Gleason scores, which suggests that TGF-b1 expression may be a useful prognostic marker for prostate cancer. Further studies of clinical specimens are needed to clarify the role of TGF-b1 in prostate carcinogenesis."

TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3 have been identified in mammals. 3,4 Although TGF-b is a pleiotropic growth factor, it inhibits growth in most cell types, especially cells of epithelial lineage.

The development of prostate cancer follows this paradigm. TGF-b is involved in two critical events that are consistently associated with the conversion from a benign state to a malignant state: 1) a reduction or loss of the sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of TGF-b and 2) an increase in the ability to elevate TGF-b expression levels, which in turn promotes carcinogenesis by stimulating extracellular matrix production, promoting angiogenesis, and inhibiting the host immune system. 8 To evaluate whether the expression levels of TGF-b1 in prostate cancer cells are associated with prognosis, as predicted by the TGF-b elevation in carcinogenesis, we investigated a putative correlation between TGF-b gene expression and Gleason score, pathological stage, and PSA serum level.",

            "text": "Some studies have suggested that decreased expression of TGF-b is not entirely necessary, as some tumor cells might escape the inhibitory effects of TGF-b through mutations that could provide a growth advantage over their benign counterparts. It has also been established that both TGF-b receptors (TbR-I and TbR-II) are required for the proper transduction of TGF-b signaling, 21 and prostate cancer cells might reduce the expression or function of either TbR-I or TbR-II to escape the growth-inhibiting effects of TGF-b. This loss of sensitivity to TGF-b by its receptors could induce a compensatory overexpression of TGF-b, thereby leading to more aggressive phenotypes. 22 Research has suggested that whether TGF-b exerts a tumor-suppressive or oncogenic effect is contextual and/or depends upon the temporal stage of cellular transformation. 23 A recent study reported that the activation of TGF-b signaling pathways might be responsible for mediating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby enhancing the invasiveness and survival of transformed cells. 24 Moreover, TGF-b can alter the host-tumor interaction, thus facilitating tumor growth, promoting angiogenesis, and inhibiting the host immune system. 9,25 By examining benign tissues from the removed prostates of patients with PCa who were treated by radical prostatectomy, we observed the same TGF-b expression pattern as in malignant tissue. This result is interesting because it allows us to propose the use of TGF-b as a tumor marker, thereby overcoming the sampling error that commonly occurs in conventional prostate biopsies; however, larger studies should be conducted to further validate our findings.",

On the other hand, TGF-b superexpression might be related to tumor progression, as it is more highly expressed in more aggressive tumors, and this finding could be explained by mutations that confer resistance to TGF-b receptors. This hypothesis also warrants further experimental studies to analyze the potential of TGF-b as a diagnostic or prognostic marker."
