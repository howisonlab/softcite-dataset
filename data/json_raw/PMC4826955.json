            "text": "Background: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury increases the risk of meniscus and articular cartilage damage, but the causes are not well understood. Previous in vitro studies were static, required extensive knee dissection, and likely altered meniscal and cartilage contact due to the insertion of pressure sensing devices. Hypothesis: ACL deficiency will lead to increased translation of the lateral meniscus and increased deformation of the medial meniscus as well as alter cartilage contact location, strain, and area. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: With minimally invasive techniques, six 1.0-mm tantalum beads were implanted into the medial and lateral menisci of 6 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees. Dynamic stereo x-rays (DSXs) were obtained during dynamic knee flexion (from 15 to 60 , simulating a standing squat) with a 46-kg load in intact and ACL-deficient states. Knee kinematics, meniscal movement and deformation, and cartilage contact were compared by novel imaging coregistration. Results: During dynamic knee flexion from 15 to 60 , the tibia translated 2.6 mm (P \u00bc .05) more anteriorly, with 2.3 more internal rotation (P \u00bc .04) with ACL deficiency. The medial and lateral menisci, respectively, translated posteriorly an additional 0.7 mm (P \u00bc .05) and 1.0 mm (P \u00bc .03). Medial and lateral compartment cartilage contact location moved posteriorly (2.0 mm [P \u00bc .05] and 2.0 mm [P \u00bc .04], respectively). Conclusion: The lateral meniscus showed greater translation with ACL deficiency compared with the medial meniscus, which may explain the greater incidences of acute lateral meniscus tears and chronic medial meniscus tears. Furthermore, cartilage contact location moved further posteriorly than that of the meniscus in both compartments, possibly imparting more meniscal stresses that may lead to early degeneration. This new, minimally invasive, dynamic in vitro model allows the study of meniscus function and cartilage contact and can be applied to evaluate different pathologies and surgical techniques. Clinical Relevance: This novel model illustrates that ACL injury may lead to significant meniscus and cartilage abnormalities acutely, and these parameters are dynamically measurable while maintaining native anatomy.",

            "text": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important restraint against anterior tibial translation, medial translation, and internal rotation, working in concert with other soft tissues and bony geometry to guide tibiofemoral kinematics during knee motion. 2,13 The medial and lateral menisci deform along the tibiofemoral joint line to guide tibiofemoral contact and improve load distribution and play a pivotal role in maintaining joint health after ACL injury, with or without reconstruction. Injury to the ACL is associated with high risk for subsequent meniscal injury and degenerative changes of the articular surfaces. 6,8,15,19,20 Because ACL injury alters knee kinematics, meniscal loading and movement may also be altered, possibly compromising knee joint load distribution and contact congruity. 2,6,26 There are, however, few data to support this conjecture.",

Previous studies assessing tibiofemoral contact and/or meniscal motion have employed methods requiring extensive dissections that disrupt the native knee anatomy and function. 3,18,23 Many of these have used sensing methods such as strain gauges to characterize meniscal strain or, more commonly, pressure sensors to measure contact. It is likely that the insertion of these types of devices alters the contact mechanics and the devices themselves result in unrepresentative measurements and an inaccurate model of the joint's true dynamics. 16 Studies evaluating the meniscus have used static in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at various flexion angles but with low loads and in varying positions, limiting their clinical application. 10,27,31 Furthermore, although previous studies have evaluated these parameters individually, none have evaluated the complex dynamic interaction between knee kinematics, cartilage contact, meniscal motion, and deformation in the intact knee as well as changes in these relationships after ACL injury of the same knee.",

Six 1.0 mm-diameter tantalum beads were implanted into the medial and lateral menisci using minimally invasive surgical techniques. For each bead, a vertical incision was made and dissection was carried down to the meniscus, being careful to maintain native ligamentous structures and minimize capsular trauma; then the meniscus was marked with a marking pen. The bead was placed in a hip arthroscopy needle with a bone wax plug in the tip and the needle pushed into the meniscus. The plunger was then used to evacuate the bead ( Figure 1A). Two beads were placed in each of 3 regions: anterior horn, midportion, and posterior horn. Bead locations were confirmed with fluoroscopy, and the capsule and other soft tissues were sutured ( Figure 1, B and C). Three additional beads were implanted into the femur and tibia for bone tracking by dissecting down to bone, where a pilot hole was drilled. The beads were placed in different planes, and locations were confirmed with fluoroscopy. Bone wax was again placed during implantation as well as over the pilot hole to secure the bead, and the overlying soft tissue was sutured. The quadriceps tendon was isolated, and the femur and tibia were potted in custom molds using fiberglass resin (Bondo Body Filler).",

The change in arc length between beads was used to measure circumferential meniscal deformation in the anterior, middle, and posterior regions in the 2 states. Radial deformation was measured between the center of the ellipse and the bead locations in these same regions. Finally, we measured vertical deformation, or meniscal compression, by the vertical movement of the beads relative to the underlying tibia, which was converted to a percentage relative to the unloaded knee. Each knee was compared with its unloaded static state.",

ACL-deficient knees had greater anterior tibial translation and internal rotation compared with knees in the intact state. 12,24 Meniscal translation was greater in the lateral compartment than in the medial compartment in the intact state and increased with ACL deficiency, and cartilage contact location was more posterior in both compartments after ACL transection. These dynamic results confirm our hypotheses and qualitatively are consistent with static in vitro studies. 12,17 We expect that modifications to the testing protocol would elicit more pronounced changes in these parameters with ACL deficiency. The flexion angles of this initial study were limited to 60 maximum, and the applied weight was limited to 46 kg due to limitations of the quadriceps clamp and the testing apparatus used. Deeper flexion, we believe, will lead to greater meniscal displacements and deformations, 33 as will increased loads. Although our load was considerably greater than that of other studies, for future work we plan to develop an improved quadriceps clamp that can sustain increased loads. However, the peak quadriceps force measured during testing was similar to that of squatting. 30 Furthermore, our knee apparatus limits us to only test the activity of a squat. A greater number of specimens may provide better statistical data: a post hoc power  analysis suggested a much greater sample size (>100) for detecting a significant difference in the deformation results with a power of >0.8. Standardized bead placement was difficult due to the minimally invasive technique as was securing the beads. This may impart some form of experimental error; however, the algorithm used mathematically minimized that error. For future testing, we plan to use better bead fixation techniques and also increase knee flexion angle and axial loading.",

Although not able to be concluded from this study, the authors believe 1 or more millimeters of shift in the meniscus and/or cartilage may lead to degeneration overtime due to loss of normal contact between the articular cartilage of the tibia and femur. During dynamic knee flexion in the intact knee, the lateral meniscus translated more than the medial meniscus, and as knee flexion angle increased so did lateral meniscus posterior translation. With ACL deficiency, both menisci showed increased posterior translation, with a greater increase in the lateral compared with the medial meniscus. A greater difference was seen at low knee flexion angles. These results are consistent with our hypotheses; as the tibia translates anteriorly with knee flexion, the menisci are pulled posteriorly on the tibia, with greater effect on the more mobile lateral meniscus. 24,29,33 Using different methodologies and low loads, previous studies found highly variable normal meniscal translations, Figure 7. Tibial internal rotation, used to evaluate knee kinematics, was increased with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency.    .

Our finding of increased meniscal translation with ACL deficiency is contrary to limited other studies that found meniscal translation was influenced by loading and not by ACL deficiency. 22,24,32 Those studies, however, were static and were further limited by MRI slice thickness or invasive techniques. 27 Dynamic meniscal evaluation, as performed in this study, likely is a better representation of true motion due to the complex nature of the meniscus and knee. The authors do not know if the observed increase in meniscal movement may lead to greater rates of meniscal tears. However, the greater change in translation of the lateral versus medial meniscus may explain the increased incidences of acute lateral meniscus tears and chronic medial meniscus tears. The medial meniscus likely sees greater stresses, and with time, likely experiences greater tear rates. 24 It is known, however, that meniscal translation is essential to prevent stress concentrations between the cartilage surfaces during knee range of motion. 1 When evaluating deformation of the menisci during dynamic knee flexion, although not statistically significant, vertical deformation or meniscal compression increased while the change in radial and circumferential deformation was minimal. These changes may lead to early meniscal degeneration. These results may be secondary to inconsistent medial-lateral and rotatory tibiofemoral kinematics with ACL deficiency, as described in the literature; however, studies evaluating meniscal deformation are limited, and the authors are not aware of any doing so dynamically. 7,17 With flexion angles limited to 60 and a 46-kg load, forces may not have been sufficient to produce marked changes in meniscal deformation. Again, we expect that with deeper flexion angles and larger loading, the circumferential fibers would be further stressed and therefore show more significant meniscal deformation.",

            "text": "Cartilage contact location is altered with ACL deficiency, possibly leading to abnormal wear and osteoarthritis. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found cartilage contact location to be significantly more posterior with ACL deficiency in both the medial and lateral compartments and exceeded the change in meniscal translation. This difference is likely due to meniscal roots and capsular attachments, which constrain the movement of the meniscus. 27 These results illustrate that the lateral compartment is more at risk for injury with ACL deficiency acutely, as seen with the pivot-shift phenomenon and the common bone bruise pattern, and chronically may lead to early osteoarthritis. 11 We found minimal differences in cartilage contact area and strain between ACL intact and deficient states. The lack of change in acute contact area and strain is consistent with the thought that the menisci are secondary restraints, so the menisci likely are picking up the forces that the ACL usually experiences, 27 thereby reducing the effects on the cartilage. These results are also consistent with the theory that chronically overloading the meniscus leads to degeneration and subsequent changes to the cartilage. 32,33 Our dynamic study evaluated only the acute phase without meniscal injury or degeneration, and therefore, cartilage changes have not yet occurred. For this reason, quantitative values found in our study are slightly different than others in the literature.",

These discrepancies are most likely due to significant differences in the loading scenarios for the 2 studies. While the true axial load for the in vivo studies is unknown, the lunge position most likely requires active stabilization, with cocontraction between the quadriceps and hamstrings to maintain a static knee flexion angle. Hamstrings activation would tend to reduce anterior tibial translation (and the associated posterior shift of tibial cartilage contact) relative to the present cadaver study, which utilized only quadriceps force to control knee flexion. While it could be argued that in vivo studies are more relevant to actual function, Li et al 17 were unable to assess meniscal function in their model. Interactions between tibiofemoral kinematics, meniscal motion, and cartilage contact were a key goal for this study.",

The core technical innovation is the unique combination of implanted radiopaque markers, DSX, and CT/ MRI-based 3D geometric modeling to assess meniscal movement and deformation during dynamic knee flexion, while maintaining native anatomy without implantation of devices within the joint that likely alter meniscal and cartilage contact mechanics. The authors are not aware of any previous studies that investigate the complex dynamic interplay between knee kinematics, meniscal motion and deformation, and cartilage contact in the intact knee as well as changes in these relationships after ACL injury. Combining simultaneous assessment of multiple parameters is essential to elucidate the role of the meniscus in the pathway from ACL injury to osteoarthritis. This knowledge is fundamental for developing and evaluating optimal treatments that preserve long-term knee joint health.",
