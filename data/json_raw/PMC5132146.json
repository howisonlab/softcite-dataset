            "text": "Various animal models of stroke have been developed to simulate the human stroke with the development of the ischemic method facilitates preclinical stroke research. The photothrombotic ischemia model, based on the intravascular photochemical reaction, is widely used for in vivo studies. However, this study has limitations, which generated a relatively small-sized infarction model on superficial cortex compared to that of the MCAO stroke model. In this study, the photothorombosis mouse model is adapted and the optimum conditions for generation of cell death and deficits with high reproducibility is determined. The extent of damage within the cortex was assessed by infarct volume and cellular/behavioral analyses. In this model, the neural cell death and inflammatory responses is detected; moreover, the degree of behavioral impairment is correlated with the brain infarct volume. Further, to enhance the understanding of neural repair, the effect of neural differentiation by transplantation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) is analyzed. The authors demonstrated that transplantation of BM-MSCs promoted the neural differentiation and behavioral performance in their photothrombosis model. Therefore, this research was meaningful to provide a stable animal model of stroke with low variability. Moreover, this model will facilitate development of novel MSC-based therapeutics for stroke."

However, permanent MCAO produces significant edema and hemorrhage within the forebrain cortex and the lesions are variable in size, which can result in unexpected behaviors [4]. In addition, differences among mouse strains in susceptibility to the effects of focal ischemia were identified, for example, the C57BL/6 strain is unsuitable for MCAO model [5]. In this study, we used a photothrombotic ischemia model that has been widely used as an experimental model. Photothrombosis models have the advantages of reproducibility, low mortality and low invasiveness with no mechanical damage to the endothelium. This model also can produce easily the well-defined infarcts in specific regions of the cortex based on photochemical reaction, and can be readily controlled by adjusting the intensity and field of light/laser [6,7].",

In particular, mice treated with C-6 irradiation exhibited the greatest increases in the levels of these proteins. Interestingly, the C-6 irradiation treated-mice also showed significant phosphorylation of p38 and MAPKAPK-2, which regulate cellular responses to extracellular stress stimuli. The p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) family and its downstream signaling molecule MAPKAPK-2 are known as signaling cascades which can control the cellular responses to cytokines and stresses [21].",

The ischemic stroke induced by photothrombosis has emerged recently as an alternative MCAO surgery, which has poor reproducibility and small infarct size. Photothrombosis is based on photochemical reaction between light and a photo-sensitive dye such as Rose Bengal. It was injected intravenously and activated by light, generating thrombotic events including peroxidative damage, platelet aggregation and coagulation cascades, which lead to microvascular occlusion [8]. This model can be easily changed by different infarct sizes and regions on focal brain. Several studies have focused on design and development of the photothrombotic ischemic model by regulating the various light sources and intensities.",

As shown in Fig. 1, infarct size in the C-6 irradiation group was greater on day 30. In contrast, the C-4 and C-5 groups showed small-sized infarct lesions that recovered spontaneously from injury. These results were verified by Western blotting and a behavioral test shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. We performed a Western blot analysis of proteins related to apoptosis and the inflammatory-response. Many reports have been already shown that inflammatory cascades are activated after ischemic events or brain injury because the ischemia closely mediates with various pathophysiological mechanisms such as disruption of glucose metabolism, reactive oxidative stress (ROS) production, necrosis and apoptosis [21-23, 25, 26]. In infarcted lesions, we detected significantly increased inflammatory responses, particularly in the C-6 irradiation group.",

These observations are consistent with previous reports that the behavioral performance of ischemic animals tended to recover spontaneously after surgery, in particular after photothrombosis [3,6,27,28]. The photothrombotic model showed a smaller ischemia penumbra on the superficial cortex compared to the MCAO model, so that infarct lesions by photothrombosis tend to readily mediate axonal reorganization and functional recovery within the brain. The exact mechanism underlying spontaneous recovery is unclear. This phenomenon is generally known due to brain plasticity with cortical reconnection and axonal sprouting in adjacent cortical areas [29,30]. After ischemia, few damaged neurons are replaced by neurogenesis, and these express markers of developing and mature of new neurons [31,32]. Therefore, to make severe ischemia penumbra with large and deep infarction like MCAO model is an important point in terms of design of animal stroke model. Recently, many studies have been focused on modifying the photothrombotic method to induce internal damage and produce severe motor deficit [33][34][35]. Therefore, our photothrombotic mouse model has possibility to replace the MCAO model as it shows longlasting neurological severity and behavioral deficit.",

After transplantation of BM-MSCs, the expression of neural and synaptic-related protein levels was increased. In particular, the human specific-proteins were detected and their expression levels increased in MSCs-treated mice. As shown in Fig. 4, we observed that the cells not only were well incorporated into the injured site but also enhanced endogenous neurogenesis. These results were confirmed in an additional experiment, Prussian blue staining. After transplantation of hBM-MSCs incorporated with nanoparticle, the cells were well detected in infarct lesion with blue dots (data not shown). Further, infarct volume and behavioral performance also recovered significantly (Fig. 5). Therefore, human BM-MSCs were successfully transplanted at the lesion site and promoted endogenous neural differentiation in our ischemia-induced mouse model. This tendency for behavioral recovery and neurogenesis is in agreement with many previous in vivo studies. The method of BM-MSCs transplantation was well known as excellent and used for neural cell therapy and for treatment of experimental ischemic stroke [9][10][11][12]. However, most studies used the MCAO model. To date, few studies using the photochemically-induced mouse model have been reported. Wang et al. demonstrated that in the photothrombosis model, the size of the irradiated area affected infarct volume and neuronal death within the cortex [34]. Li et al. reported microglia proliferation and behavioral deficits after photothrombosis-induced brain ischemia in adult mice [36]. Ma et al. and Hou et al. reported that transplantation of neural stem cells enhanced neurological function in a photothrombosis stroke model, showing decreased infarct areas [37,38]. However, there were no reports on the effects of transplantation of MSCs on neurogenesis in the photothrombosis stroke model. Our study is meaningful as it is the first report of the neurogenic effect of BM-MSCs in a photothrombosis mouse model, which has not been demonstrated before.",

This model will contribute to provide novel methods for developing a stable animal model of stroke. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that our study has the potential to improve understanding of the photothrombotic stroke model. Moreover, we proposed a new parameter for MSC-based stroke therapy. To establish the clinical trials, further studies will be required to understand the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiological processes after ischemic stroke."
