RESULTS Tpl2 is induced by IL-12 stimulation To identify genes rapidly induced by IL-12, microarray analysis was conducted using human PBMC enriched for CD3 + T cells after stimulation for 6 h. Approximately 90 genes were diff erentially induced by IL-12 stimulation. The top 30 most highly IL-12-inducible genes are depicted in Fig. S1 (available at http:// www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081461/DC1). These include known IL-12-inducible genes such as IFNG, IL12RB2, IL18R1, TBX21 (T-bet), and GZMB, lending validity to this study (17). In addition, the MAPK family member Tpl2 (also known as MAP3K8) was noted to be IL-12 inducible. A previous microarray study of polarized Th1 cells stimulated with IL-12 also included Tpl2 as a Th1-specifi c gene, but these results were not verifi ed (17). To confi rm these microarray results, we fi rst performed Northern blot analysis on PBMC stimulated with various cytokines. Consistent with the microarray data, IL-12 alone specifi cally induced Tpl2 mRNA (Fig. 1 A , lane 5). Furthermore, Tpl2 was preferentially induced in human naive CD4 + cord blood T cells that had been cultured under Th1, compared with Th2, diff erentiating conditions for 7 d (Fig. 1 B). IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR to confi rm the proper polarization of the Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively (unpublished data). Because IL-12 is a potent inducer of IFN-\u2425 and Th1 cells produce IFN-\u2425 , these studies did not discriminate between induction of Tpl2 directly by IL-12 or indirectly through IFN-\u2425. The time course of Tpl2 mRNA induction in response to IL-12 was very rapid, within 1 h of stimulation (Fig. 1 A , right), suggesting a direct mode of regulation. To formally test this hypothesis, we stimulated cells directly with IL-12 or IFN-\u2425. IL-12 stimulation of human PBMC induced Tpl2 expression, whereas direct stimulation with IFN-\u2425 did not (unpublished data). The same was true in purifi ed mouse CD4 + T cells, demonstrating that Tpl2 was regulated by IL-12 directly in both human and mouse cells (Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, IL-12 stimulation induced Tpl2 expression even in IFN-\u2425-defi cient mouse T cells, excluding an indirect mode of regulation through IFN-\u2425 (Fig. 1 D). To determine if Tpl2 induction is specifi c to IL-12 stimulation, we investigated whether IL-23, which shares the p40 ligand subunit and the IL-12R \u2424 1 receptor chain with IL-12 (26), could induce Tpl2 expression. Although IL-23 induced production of IL-17 mRNA as expected (not depicted), IL-23 failed to induce Tpl2 expression (Fig. 1 E). These data provide further evidence of direct and specifi c induction of Tpl2 by IL-12. However, previous studies on cell lines have suggested that Tpl2 is also induced by TCR signaling (18, 24, 27). Indeed, activation of CD4 + T cells with plate-bound anti-CD3 and-CD28 led to rapid and sustained induction of Tpl2 (Fig. 1 F). We therefore conclude that Tpl2 is dynamically regulated in T lymphocytes by both T cell receptor engagement and IL-12. Because the major IL-12 signaling intermediate is Stat4, we investigated whether Tpl2 up-regulation is dependent on this transcription factor. Notably, IL-12 stimulation failed to induce Tpl2 mRNA expression in Stat4-defi cient CD4 + T cells, suggesting that Tpl2 gene expression is regulated by",

Specifi cally, IL-12 is required for Th1 eff ector cell diff erentiation from naive CD4 + T cells and for the secretion of the potent infl ammatory cytokine, IFN-\u2425 ( 5 -7 ). IFN-\u2425 , in turn, plays a major role in cell-mediated immunity by enhancing the bactericidal responses of macrophages, stimulating antigen presentation to T cells, inducing B cell antibody class switching, enhancing cytotoxic responses Tpl2 (Tumor progression locus 2), also known as Cot/MAP3K8, is a hematopoietically expressed serine-threonine kinase. Tpl2 is known to have critical functions in innate immunity in regulating tumor necrosis factor -\u2423 , Toll-like receptor, and G protein -coupled receptor signaling; however, our understanding of its physiological role in T cells is limited. We investigated the potential roles of Tpl2 in T cells and found that it was induced by interleukin-12 in human and mouse T cells in a Stat4-dependent manner. Defi ciency of Tpl2 was associated with impaired interferon (IFN)-\u2425 production. Accordingly, Tpl2 \u060a / \u060a mice had impaired host defense against Toxoplasma gondii with reduced parasite clearance and decreased IFN-\u2425 production. Furthermore, reconstitution of Rag2 \u060a / \u060a mice with Tpl2defi cient T cells followed by T. gondii infection recapitulated the IFN-\u2425 defect seen in the Tpl2-defi cient mice, confi rming a T cell -intrinsic defect. CD4 + T cells isolated from Tpl2 \u060a / \u060a mice showed poor induction of T-bet and failure to up-regulate Stat4 protein, which is associated with impaired TCR-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. These data underscore the role of Tpl2 as a regulator of T helper cell lineage decisions and demonstrate that Tpl2 has an important functional role in the regulation of Th1 responses.",

The importance of Tyk2, Jak2, and Stat4 in IL-12 signaling is substantiated by strong genetic evidence ( 8 -11 ). Defi ciency of Tyk2 greatly diminishes IL-12 signaling ( 13 ), but defi ciency of Jak2 has even more profound consequences, including embryonic lethality caused by its role in erythropoiesis ( 14 ). Other signaling molecules, such as the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinse (MAPK), have also been implicated in IL-12 signaling, but their actions have not yet been fully defi ned ( 15,16 ).",

To this end, we and others have performed microarray analysis to identify IL-12 -regulated genes ( 17 ). One gene that was prominently induced by IL-12 was Tpl2/Cot (tumor progression locus 2/Cancer Osaka thyroid; also known as MAP3K8). Originally identifi ed as a protooncogene ( 18 ), Tpl2 is a serinethreonine kinase belonging to the MAPK family that has essential functions in innate immune cells where it transmits signals via Toll-like receptors, the TNF family of receptors ( 19 ), and G protein -coupled receptors ( 20 ). When overexpre ssed in a variety of cell types, it activates all of the MAPK pathways, NFAT, and NF-B ( 21 -24 ). Its signaling output, however, appears to be cell type dependent and signal dependent ( 20,25 ). In APCs, it is reported to be an obligatory upstream activator of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and to function as a critical regulator of TNF-\u2423 production in response to TLR signals ( 19 ). However, surprisingly little is known about its functions in normal T cells.",

            "text": "To investigate the role of Tpl2 in T helper polarization, we isolated naive CD62L hi CD44 lo CD4 + T cells from WT or Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice by FACS sorting and cultured the cells with appropriate cytokines and anticytokine antibodies to generate Th0, Th1, Th2, or Th17 cells. Under neutral conditions (Th0), fewer IFN-\u2425 + cells were generated by Tpl2deficient cells ( Fig. 4 A , left). Even when Tpl2-deficient cells were cultured under optimal Th1-polarizing conditions, differentiation into Th1 cells was still attenuated as measured by intracellular cytokine staining, ELISA, and realtime PCR ( Fig. 4, A -C ). However, Th2 diff erentiation was not further augmented by Tpl2 defi ciency under optimal Th2 conditions ( Fig. 4 A , right). Interestingly, IL-17 production was also impaired in Tpl2-defi cient cells cultured under Th17 conditions ( Fig. 4 D ). These data are consistent with the idea that Tpl2 defi ciency is associated with an intrinsic impairment of TCR-and IL-12 -dependent Th1 responses. stimulation, WT or Tpl2-defi cient CD4 + T cells were fi rst activated with anti-CD3 and -CD28 for 3 d to induce IL-12R expression, rested in cytokine-free medium for 5 h, and stimulated with IL-12. Tpl2-defi cient T cells were signifi cantly diminished in their capacity to produce IFN-\u2425 ( Fig. 3 A , left). Furthermore, this defect could not be overcome by stimulation with IL-12 in combination with IL-2 and was only partially rescued by IL-12 plus IL-18 ( Fig. 3 A , middle and right), both of which are known to synergize with IL-12 for IFN-\u2425 production. Although IL-12 stimulation alone was insuffi cient to visualize intracellular IFN-\u2425 staining (not depicted), the combination of IL-12 and IL-18 yielded 14% IFN-\u2425 + cells in WT compared with only 1% in Tpl2-defi cient T cells ( Fig. 3 B ). These data clearly indicate that there is a decrease in the proportion of Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea CD4 + T cells capable of making IFN-\u2425 under these conditions. The IFN-\u2425 defect was also confi rmed in human cells using a small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown approach ( Fig. S2, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/ jem.20081461/DC1). The siRNA approach additionally demonstrates that altered IFN-\u2425 production by Tpl2-defi cient T Figure 3. Tpl2 is required for optimal IL-12 -induced IFN-\u2425 production. (A and B) IL-12 -induced IFN-\u2425 production was analyzed in WT and Tpl2-defi cient CD4 + T cells. CD4 + T cells isolated from WT or Tpl2defi cient mouse LN and spleens were activated and expanded on anti-CD3 -and -CD28 -coated fl asks for 3 d. Cells were then rested for 5 h in cytokine-free medium before stimulation with 0 -10 ng/ml IL-12 alone or in combination with 50 U/ml IL-2 or 10 ng/ml IL-18 for 24 h. Cytokine production was measured in cell culture supernatants using cytometric bead array (A) or intracellular cytokine staining (B). (C) For intracellular cytokine staining, rested cells were restimulated with IL-12 and IL-18 for 24 h with the addition of Golgi transport inhibitor for the last 5 h of culture. Whole splenocytes were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 for 48 h, and the production of IFN-\u2425 was measured by cytometric bead array.

Error bars represent SD from replicates within a representative experiment. defi cient mice as measured by real-time PCR ( Fig. 5 A , top) and surface staining ( Fig. 5 A , bottom). Despite normal receptor expression, both IL-12 -dependent Stat4 serine and tyrosine phosphorylation were dramatically reduced in Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice, owing to reduced levels of total Stat4 protein and mRNA ( Fig. 5, B and C ).

Assessment of IL-12R \u2424 1 and IL-12R \u2424 2 showed similar expression levels of both subunits in activated CD4 + T cells from WT or Tpl2-  Encysted bradyzoites are found in the muscle and nervous tissue of chronically infected animals, and their abundance can be related to parasite control during the acute phase. Consistent with the defect in IFN-\u2425 production and increased pathogen load, Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice developed fourfold greater numbers of brain cysts after 5 wk of infection ( Fig. 6 E ). Collectively, CD4 + T cells did not have altered levels of Stat4 expression ( Fig. S3, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/ full/jem.20081461/DC1). However, Stat4 is inducible upon T cell activation ( 12 ), and this Stat4 induction was diminished in TCR-activated Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea T cells ( Fig. 5, B and C ). The reduced levels of Stat4 protein in cultured CD4 + T cells were associated with reduced recruitment of Stat4 to the mouse Ifng promoter in response to IL-12 signaling, demonstrating that this diff erence is functionally relevant ( Fig. 5 D ). Additionally, purifi ed CD4 + T cells from Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice failed to properly induce T-bet protein when stimulated with anti-CD3 and -CD28 ( Fig. 5 E , left), whereas Gata3 protein was regulated normally. Accordingly, at the transcriptional level a greater than twofold increase in the ratio of Gata3/T-bet mRNAs was seen by real-time PCR ( Fig. 5 E , right). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Tpl2 contributes to Th1 diff erentiation in activated T cells by ensuring proper induction of the key transcription factors T-bet and Stat4. These defects appeared to arise during the TCR activation phase. Therefore, we examined Tpl2-dependent events in response to TCR activation. We analyzed ERK activation in response to CD3 cross-linking and, consistent with recently published data ( 28 ), we found that ERK activation is impaired in the Tpl2-defi cient T cells ( Fig. 5 F ). Based on these data, we propose a model for the role of Tpl2 in Th1 diff erentiation as depicted in Fig. S4.",

Despite the fact that Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea APCs overproduce IL-12 both in vitro in response to TLR ligands ( 19,30 ) and in vivo in response to T. gondii infection ( Fig. 6 A ), T. gondii -infected Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice produced significantly less IFN-\u2425 systemically than WT mice. Additionally, reduced amounts of MCP-1 (CCL2), an IFN-\u2425 -inducible chemokine, were present in sera of infected mice, whereas IL-6 levels were unaff ected by Tpl2 defi ciency ( Fig. 6 A ). There were similar numbers and proportions of T cells and NK cells in spleens and peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) isolated from infected and uninfected WT or Tpl2-defi cient mice (unpublished data), suggesting that altered cellular responsiveness and not development/recruitment was responsible for the defective IFN-\u2425 production. Recall responses of lymphocytes to soluble T. gondii antigen (STAg) taken from day-7 infected mice also showed impaired antigen-specifi c T cell responses in the Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea cells as measured by IFN-\u2425 secretion ( Fig. 6 B ). The susceptibility of Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice to T. gondii was further assessed by quantifying the number of infected PECs persisting at day 7 after infection. Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice retained detectable parasites within the PECs, whereas WT mice had cleared the local infection by this time point ( Fig. 6, C and D ).",

It is clear that Tpl2 has a T cell -intrinsic role in IL-12 signaling and IFN-\u2425 production because in vitro polarization of naive CD4 + T cells toward the Th1 phenotype is impaired in Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea cells, even under conditions antagonistic to Th2 polarization (i.e., in the presence of neutralizing IL-4 antibody). In this setting, continued neutralization of Th2 responses did not reverse the Th1/IFN-\u2425 defect in vitro, indicating that impaired IFN-\u2425 production by Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea CD4 + T cells cannot be explained simply by enhanced Th2 responses.",

Although this results in impaired IL-12 signaling as determined by Stat4 recruitment to the Ifng promoter, the impaired expression of Stat4 apparently arises during initial TCR-dependent actions. A recent study has shown that Tpl2 is required for the optimal activation of ERK and MEK in response to TCR stimulation ( 28 ). Our data have confi rmed that ERK phosphorylation induced by TCR occupancy is partially Tpl2-dependent in T cells ( Fig. 5 F ). Whether Stat4 induction by TCR signals is ERK dependent remains to be determined. However, T cells defi cient in the ERK-activated transcription factor Ets-1 have been shown to have impaired Th1 responses and reduced levels of Stat4 ( 36 ). Precisely how Tpl2 contributes to the regulation of Stat4 and T-bet protein levels is unclear but is worthy of future investigation.",

To more carefully assess the in vivo function of Tpl2-defi cient T cells, we reconstituted Rag2-defi cient mice with WT or Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea CD4 + T cells and then infected the mice with T. gondii . As expected, Rag2-defi cient mice that did not receive any T cells rapidly succumbed to infection, whereas mice receiving WT T cells were protected ( Fig. 6 F ). Similar to what was observed in Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea mice, mice adoptively transferred with Tpl2-defi cient T cells produced signifi cantly less IFN-\u2425 than mice receiving WT T cells ( Fig. 6 G ). Furthermore, mice receiving Tpl2 KO T cells died shortly after infection with kinetics similar to Rag-defi cient mice that had not received any T cells ( Fig. 6 F ), although no diff erences were found in reconstitution potentials between WT and Tpl2 \u03ea / \u03ea CD4 + T cells (not depicted). We interpret these data to suggest that hyperproduction of IL-12 by Tpl2-defi cient APCs in the complete Tpl2-defi cient mice likely partially masks a more dramatic T cell phenotype in this model.

In this study, we show that Tpl2, which is inducible by TCR occupancy and IL-12, is important for T cell diff erentiation and eff ector functions. Activation of Tpl2-defi cient CD4 + T cells via cross-linking of the TCR led to impaired development of Th1 responses. Furthermore, IL-12 stimulation of activated Tpl2-defi cient T cells also showed major defects in IFN-\u2425 production. Accordingly, Tpl2-defi cient T cells had reduced levels of Stat4 and T-bet, two factors which are critical for Th1 diff erentiation. This abnormal response was physiologically relevant in host defense against the model pathogen T. gondii , in which IFN-\u2425 induction was impaired and the pathogen burden was increased. Using adoptive transfer experiments, we established that this increased susceptibility was caused by an intrinsic T cell defect. These fi ndings are interesting from several perspectives and have multiple implications.",

Because TNF blockade has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of several infl ammatory diseases ( 40 ), Tpl2 kinase has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target. A Tpl2 inhibitor has been generated and shown to inhibit LPSinduced TNF-\u2423 production by human monocytes and in LPStreated mice ( 41,42 ). Despite the fact that Tpl2 inhibition might also be benefi cial in treating autoimmunity driven by IFN-\u2425 and IL-17, our data suggest that targeting Tpl2 might attenuate Th1 diff erentiation and impair T cell responses to infection.
