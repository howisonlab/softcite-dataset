            "text": "The aim of this study was to identify prognostic significance of microRNA-100 (miR-100) in solid tumor. Methods: Literature search was conducted in databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science, using the following words \"(microRNA-100 OR miR-100 OR mir100) AND (tumor OR neoplasm OR cancer OR carcinoma OR malignancy).\" The search was updated up until July 10, 2016. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of studies. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for patients' survival was calculated by using a fixed-effects or a random-effects model on the basis of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis, sensitive analysis, and meta-regression were used to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated by using Begg's and Egger's tests. Results: A total of 16 articles with 1,501 patients were included in the present meta-analysis. It was demonstrated that a lower expression of miR-100 plays a negative role in the overall survival (OS) of patients with solid tumor (HR =1.92; 95% CI =1.25-2.94). In addition, the association between miR-100 and prognosis was also revealed in the following subgroups: nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; HR =2.46; 95% CI =1.98-3.06), epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC; HR =2.29, 95% CI =1.72-3.04), and bladder cancer (BC; HR =4.14, 95% CI =1.85-9.27). Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicates that lower expression of miR-100 is related to poorer OS in patients with solid tumor, especially in those with NSCLC, EOC, and BC. MiR-100 is a promising prognosis predictor and may be a potential target for therapy in the future."

            "text": "MicroRNAs, noncoding small RNAs, regulate mRNA at the posttranscriptional level, leading to degradation or inhibition of the target mRNA. Research on microRNAs began in 1993. 1,2 Since then, an increasing number of microRNAs were discovered, and it was found that play an important role in a variety of biological activities including proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and apoptosis. [3][4][5] The association between microRNAs and cancer was first reported in 2002 by Calin et al, who observed that miR-15 and miR-16 acted as negative regulators of Bcl-2 in cancer, especially chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 6 It is now clear that microRNAs play a crucial role in cancer cells. Moreover, the clinical use of microRNA is being widely investigated. As a result, currently, multiple research studies have been exploring the prognostic function of microRNA-100 (miR-100) in cancer patients in order to find a reliable biomarker to guide for cancer treatment. 7,8 As a member of the miR-99 family, miR-100 is located on Chromosome 11 at 11q24.1. 9 Its aberrant expression was reported in various cancers including nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), 10 oral squamous cell carcinoma, 11 esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), 12 small cell carcinoma of the cervix (SCCC), 13 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 14,15 endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), 16 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 17,18 bladder cancer (BC), 19,20 renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 21 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 22,23 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 24 colorectal cancer (CRC), 25,26 and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 27 This aberrant expression of miR-100 not only has diagnostic implications but also can predict cancer patient survival. 28 From this perspective, it may be feasible to predict prognosis based on miR-100 expression level. However, the correlation between them remains controversial to some extent. In some studies, miR-100 was reported as a tumor suppressor, whose low expression level was a negative prognostic factor. 16,17 In contrast, in some articles, miR-100 was regarded as an oncogene. 21,27 Therefore, this metaanalysis was conducted to identify the relationship between miR-100 expression level and the survival of cancer patients, by pooling the hazard ratio (HR) from studies addressing the correlation between miR-100 and overall survival (OS) of patients with solid tumor.",

HR \ue02e1 indicates that lower expression of miR-100 is an unfavorable prognostic factor, and HR \ue02c1 suggests that lower expression of miR-100 confers survival advantage to the patients. If the HR value was calculated by a multivariate analysis, then it was extracted directly; if multivariate analysis was not available, then results from univariate analysis were also accepted in the meta-analysis. If both multivariate analysis and univariate analysis were not offered, Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate HR value by using the described method. 31 In addition, original survival data obtained, if possible, can also be used to calculate HR by conducting survival analysis.",

            "text": "Lack of a reliable biomarker to predict prognosis is a main hurdle to realize individualized treatment. Fortunately, emerging data favor the potential use of miR-100 as a cancer prognostic predictor. In recent years, downstream targets of miR-100 have widely been investigated in several signal pathways, which may provide evidence for its potential clinical use at a molecule level. First, miR-100 facilitated cancer cell proliferation and growth by targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). By using GeneChip \u00ae miRNA Array and qRT-PCR, Xu et al 41 identified decreased expression of miR-100 in bladder tumor tissues and found that ectopic restoration of miR-100 expression suppressed tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis indicated that mTOR was the direct target of miR-100. 41 Consistently, another study on esophageal squamous cell cancer also supported this report. Sun et al transfected esophageal squamous cell cancer cell lines with miR-100 precursor molecules and reported the subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation, which was attributed to the fact that miR-100 downregulated the expression of mTOR by directly targeting its 3\u2032UTR in a posttranscriptional manner. 22 In gynecologic cancer, this interaction exists. Torres et al observed that decreased miR-100 in EEC tissues coexisted with increased mTOR kinase. 16 With respect to cell growth, another potential target of miR-100 may be FGFRs. Bi et al transfected U2OS cells (human osteosarcoma line) with a miR-100 construct or with an antisense of miR-100. 42 It was observed that overexpression of miR-100 led to decreased expression of FGFR3 protein. Conversely, inhibition of miR-100 induced FGFR3 protein expression. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay implied that 3\u2032UTR of FGFR3 mRNA was the direct target of miR-100. Based on these experimental results, Bi et al 42 pointed out that miR-100 served as a tumor suppressor by  12 4 0 e,f 2 g 6 huang et al 13 4 0 e,f 2 g 6 Torres et al 16 4 0 e,f 2 g 6 Peng et al 17 4 1 e 2 g 7 Wang et al 19 4 1 e 2 g 7 liu et al 14 4 1 e 2 g 7 Wang et al 21 4 1 e 2 g 7 sun et al 22 4 2 1 g,h 7 chen et al 24 4 1 e 2 g 7 chen et al 25 4 1 e 2 g 7 Zhou et al 23 4 1 e 3 8 cao et al 20 4 1 e 2 g 7 Zhang et al 40 0 a-d 0 e,f 1 g,h 1 luo et al 15 4 0 e,f 2 g 6 Dhayat et al 27 4 1 f 3 8 Zhang et al 26 4 1 e 1 g,i 6 Azizmohammadi et al 18  4 1 e 1 g,h 6",

Another study on BC also revealed that the reduction of miR-100 expression induced sixfold upregulation of FGFR3 protein through an interaction with FGFR3 mRNA. 43 Similar result was also reported in non-small-cell lung. 15 Second, miR-100 participated in cancer cell apoptosis, which also determines the development of the tumor. Chen et al observed that miR-100 precursor elevated expression of cleaved caspase-3 and pro-caspase-3 protein, which are two key apoptosis proteins. 24 In order to find the mechanism, flow cytometry and Western blot analysis were used to assess the apoptosis in siRNA/plk 1-transfected human hepatocellular cells. The outcome showed that  siRNA/plk 1 could mimic the effect of miR-100, indicating plk1 as a potential target of miR-100. In another digestive cancer, gastric cancer, Notch pathway was reported to participate in the miR-100-mediated apoptosis, which is initiated by the interaction between miR-100 and HS3ST2. 44 Third, miR-100 regulated several components of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, including \u03b2-catenin, metalloproteinase-7, T-cell factor-4, and lymphoid enhancing factor-1, which were closely related to cell invasion and tumor metastasis. 45 Transwell migration and invasion assay by Jiang showed that transfection of miR-100 mimic suppressed migration and invasion of breast cancer compared to the control group. The direct target of miR-100 in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be FZD-8. 46 Bhushan et al also found that downregulation of miR-100 may account for less invasion of breast cancer cells. 47 In addition, Fu et al also consolidated the role miR-100 played in invasion and metastasis of esophageal squamous cell cancer by using bioinformatics analyses. 48 Fourth, cell cycle arrest, which is responsible for radio-resistance or chemo-resistance, was mediated by miR-100. Xiao et al discovered that the introduction of miR-100 mimic in H69 cells (human small cell lung cancer cell line) led to downregulation of HOXA1 protein, inducing G0-G1 and G1-M cell cycle arrest, which was associated with drug resistance. 49 A study by Shi et al documented that miR-100 can target plk1 and mediated G2/M arrest in NPC. 10 Together, miR-100 might be a promising prognostic predictor. Despite the sort of inconsistency, clinical investigations favor predictive use of miR-100 for the survival of cancer patients. Peng et al retrospectively collected fresh surgical tissues from 98 patients with EOC and used qRT-PCR assay to assess the expression level of miR-100. 17 It is revealed that the expression of miR-100 was significantly lower in epithelial ovarian tumor tissue than in adjacent normal tissue. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lower expression of miR-100 was accompanied by shorter survival (HR =2.12; 95% CI =1.88-3.41). Further evidence on endometrial carcinoma also supported the finding that decreased expression level of miR-100 worsens prognosis, with a HR of 2.94 (low/ high). 16 Similar results were obtained for digestive system cancers. Zhou investigated 120 patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer who received radiotherapy alone and concluded that HRs for locoregional progression-free survival (PFS), distant PFS, and OS (low/high) were 8.9, 8.34, and 8.02, respectively, suggesting that downregulation of miR-100 indicated poor prognosis. 23 In BC, Wang et al reported that 3-year OS and 3-year PFS for high expression level of miR-100 were 33 and 26 months, respectively; on the other hand, for low expression level of miR-100, they were merely 23 and 16 months, respectively. 19 However, it should be noted that literature on the prognostic value of miR-100 reveals conflicting findings. Wang et al found increased miR-100 expression in cancer tissues compared with normal tissues in patients with renal cell cancer. 21 HRs for OS and tumor-specific survival were 0.28 and 0.41, respectively, both of which were statistically significant, suggesting that lower expression of miR-100 confers survival advantage. Dhayat et al focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Union for International Cancer Control stage II and found that lower level of miR-100 is a favorable factor to predict treatment response and OS. 27 Apart from studies revealing the survival difference, a study by Zhang showed that the difference in miR-100 expression level did not lead to statistic difference in the survival of patients with CRC. 26 In order to clarify the relationship between miR-100 and survival of patients with solid tumor, this meta-analysis was conducted.  In order to ensure reliable outcome, the inclusion criteria were strictly limited. First, source of RNA was restricted to tissue or blood. As a result, a study by Wang et al was not accepted, because it explored miR-100 in malignant effusion in NSCLC. 39 Second, Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used. As shown in Table 1, most studies (16 of 17) were evaluated as of high quality; however, only two studies received nine stars, the highest score. The most common reasons why the research was deprived of stars lay in the comparability and outcome aspects. In terms of comparability, majority of the studies (15 of 17) did not control the most important factor such as TNM stage; some studies (6 of 17) did not control other less important factors, such as age, gender, and smoking status of the patients, which would bring potential bias to the survival outcome. In addition, it is necessary for prognosis studies to describe whether the survival outcome was attained by self-report or blind assessment, which was stated in Newcastle-Ottawa scale. However, only two studies mentioned this category. 23,27 Lastly, follow-up rate is not fully recorded. Only a minority of studies described the number of lost patients and offered the reason for loss. Considering these reasons, more stars have been provided in outcome category. It is noteworthy that Zhang et al analyzed survival data from the TCGA database and did not provide sufficient related information to get at least six stars according to Newcastle-Ottawa scale. 40 Hence, although it investigated the association between miR-100 expression and OS, it was excluded as a study of low quality.",

            "text": "Finally, 16 studies were included. According to the present study, decreased miR-100 expression level confers survival disadvantage in patients with solid tumor (HR =1.92; 95% CI =1.25-2.94). This relationship was also found in the following subgroups: NSCLC (HR =2.46; 95% CI =1.98-3.06; fixed-effects model), EOC (HR =2.29; 95% CI =1.72-3.04; fixed-effects model), and BC (HR =4.14; 95% CI =1.85-9.27; fixed-effects model). In order to find the potential source of heterogeneity, first, subgroup analysis was conducted, which revealed that heterogeneity declined dramatically in NSCLC group (I 2 =0; P=0.70), EOC group (I 2 =69.6%; P=0.07), and BC group (I 2 =52.7%; P=0.15). Therefore, cancer type might partly account for heterogeneity. Previously, several meta-analyses classified subgroups according to the method used to assess RNA (qRT-PCR versus in situ hybridization) and the source of RNA (blood versus tissue). 30 Nonetheless, these variants were similar between the studies included in the present meta-analysis. As a result, the possibility of these variants as the source of heterogeneity was eliminated, and there was no requirement to perform further subgroup analysis. Owing to the results that sensitivity analysis did not reveal the source of heterogeneity, meta-regression was further conducted, which revealed that P-value of patient origin, the method used to calculate HR, and cancer type were all \ue02e0.05, with adjusted R 2 being 16.54%, \u22128.6%, and \u221210.95%, respectively. Meta-regression results showed that although these factors might explain part of heterogeneity, but it did not reach statistical significance. Meta-regression could have been used to analyze whether other factors such as follow-up time, related treatment methods, and cutoff value had an impact on heterogeneity, but, due to insufficient information on or remarkably different definition of cutoff value, the necessity and scientific implication to carry out this metaregression in these variants were uncertain.",

            "text": "As it is well known, meta-analysis results are more robust than the result of single research. However, it is noteworthy that strict inclusion and exclusion criteria are a prerequisite for pooled data, which made the present results more reliable than the previous ones. 50,51 Despite careful assessment of study quality, there are limitations in the present study. First, heterogeneity among the studies included is relatively high. According to subgroup analysis, tumor type could partly explain the source of heterogeneity. Nonetheless, other potential factors may also exist. For instance, pathological type may be a potential source. The pooled HR from ESCC subgroup was 4.61 (95% CI =2.36-8.99; I 2 =0; fixed-effects model) compared to esophageal cancer (HR =1.82; 95% CI =0.32-10.32; I 2 =88.5%; random-effects model). 22,23 In addition, because of insufficient data, it was difficult to further assess the effects of other variants on heterogeneity. For instance, TNM stage, postoperative treatment, and follow-up method were not clearly stated in all the studies. Second, the power of miR-100 as a stand-alone biomarker is presumably weak and varies for different tumor types, given the fact that interaction between microRNA and its target is complicated. Undoubtedly, microRNA signature may be a better option that has been investigated in other microRNAs. 52 However, to date, such microRNA signature comprising miR-100 was not reported. Third, the definition of cutoff value varied among the studies. Some research studies chose median value to define the expression level of miR-100, yet some used mean value or value calculated by receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, although publication bias was not revealed by Begg's and Egger's tests, the funnel plot is slightly asymmetric. The limitations emphasize the need for well-designed and well-conducted prognostic studies on miR-100 in the future.",
