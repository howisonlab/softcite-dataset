Increased intima-media thickness and decreased arterial compliance are associated with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. This study included 20 patients and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The compliance and intima-media thickness of the right common carotid artery within 1 cm to the bifurcation were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode echocardiography. Blood samples were obtained to measure levels of hemoglobin, phosphorus, total calcium, total CO2, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, serum total cholesterol, LDL-and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. We found that the compliance of common carotid artery was lower in the patient group than in the control group. In the patient group, the compliance of common carotid artery was positively correlated with serum albumin concentration, and intima-media thickness of common carotid artery was negatively correlated with serum albumin levels. Stepwise regression analysis showed that serum albumin concentration was independently related to the compliance of common carotid artery, suggesting hypoalbuminemia can independently give deleterious effects on the arterial wall in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.",

            "text": "Despite renal replacement treatment, cardiovascular disease is the prime cause of morbidity and mortality among endstage renal disease patients, leading to more than 50% of the deaths in such patients (1). Structural and functional changes such as increased intima-media thickness and decreased arterial compliance are associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease (2). A carotid intima-media thickness of >0.09 cm and/or the presence of discrete plaques are markers of generalized atherosclerosis and have a positive graded association with cardiovascular risk factors (3). Arterial compliance, an important vessel wall property, reflects the buffering capacity of a vessel. A low arterial compliance caused by arterial stiffening widens pulse pressure amplitude by increasing systolic blood pressure and decreasing diastolic blood pressure. Increased systolic blood pressure induces left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas decreased diastolic blood pressure impairs coronary blood flow. Wide pulse pressure may be a major predictor of cardiac risk, especially coronary mortality (4)(5)(6).",

In the dialysis population, there is increasing evidence of a link between inflammation, signified by elevated C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 levels, and cardiovascular mortality (21,22). Therefore, it is possible that poor nutrition, serum albumin levels and atherosclerosis could be interlinked by inflammation. However, in contrast, a recent study (23) showed that protein malnutrition (diagnosed based upon total body nitrogen levels) and hypoalbuminemia were independently predictive of mortality, whereas only hypoalbuminemia was predictive of vascular morbidity. That study suggested hypoalbuminemia itself was pathogenically associated with vascular disease, but dissociated this effect from protein malnutrition (23). In the present study, we excluded patients with severe malnutrition and those with a level of established infection above the upper level of that observed in normal controls. Our data revealed no relationship between serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels and common carotid artery compliance in the patient group. This finding suggests that the serum albumin level itself is related to changes in compliance and intimamedia thickness in the elastic common carotid artery.",

In our stepwise regression analysis, serum albumin levels were correlated with common carotid artery compliance independent of age, blood pressure, common carotid artery intima-media thickness, calcium and phosphorus levels, lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Furthermore, the common carotid artery intima-media thickness was found to be inversely proportional to serum albumin levels.
