Using this instrument for ACDF has potential strengths compared with the anterior plating method. First, Zero-P could reduce the volume of the anterior plate, which might reduce post-operative dysphagia and simultaneously fix the cage strongly between the segments. Several published studies support this hypothesis without any significant disadvantage in clinical and radiographic"

To reduce postoperative complications, such as post-operative iliac pain and dysphagia, the stand-alone cage was developed [2][3][4]11,27) . Compared to the traditional procedure, multiple studies have argued that the stand-alone cage produces more subsidence and local kyphosis at the index level, however no difference in clinical outcome has been proven 2,4,6,11,21,27) . Because of its advantages (convenience of use and decreased complications, as noted above) and less evidence of disadvantages relative to the standard procedure, the stand-alone cage is widely used for ACDF.",

We measured the Cobb angle of segmental area (Cobb-s) and Cobb angle of global cervical spine (Cobb-c) in the cervical spine plain X-ray lateral view to evaluate the aggravation of kyphosis ( Fig. 1). Initially, we planned to evaluate bone fusion, but because of a lack of CT data (post-operative CT is not a standard procedure because of radiation hazard), we evaluated bone fusion through X-ray lateral view. Bone fusion was judged by 2 spine surgeons on radiographs by 1) less than 10 degree movement on lateral flexion/extension views, 2) presence of bridging trabecular bone between the endplates on anteroposterior and lateral views, 3) less than 50% radiolucency in the perimeter surrounding the cage, and 4) no evidence of pull out of the device. We compared the bone fusion rate of the each group on post-operative 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The kappa coefficients for hinge status at each observation were 0.69, 0.71, 0.68, and 0.77, respectively. Kappa coefficients of 0.68-0.77 suggest good agreement among the observers. Also, we compared pre-and post-operative disc height (DH) and vertebral height (VH) in the plain X-ray images to evaluate the degree of subsidence to estimate the spinal alignment state indirectly. We measured the anterior-posterior length of the superior vertebrae at operation level in the X-ray 18) and in the pre-operative CT scan or MRI, which demonstrate actual length (aAP). These data were used for the calculation of actual length of DH (aDH; DH\u00d7aAP/AP) and VH (aVH; VH\u00d7aAP/AP) 11) .",

Spine surgeons commonly use the stand-alone cage to avoid the discomfort of the anterior plate and autologous bone graft. However, if the Zero-P shows a superior outcome over the standalone cage and a similar outcome to the anterior plate system, this technique could be a good alternative. In this study, we followed patients for more than 2 years to compare radiographic and clinical outcomes of the Zero-P and the stand-alone polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage (Cervios; Synthes GmbH, Oberdorf, Switzerland) packed with demineralized bone matrix (DBM; Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, NJ, USA)."

The aVH measure had a similar tendency to the aDH scores. The VH was also improved right after the surgery; 38.4\u00b13.6 in the cage group and 39.0\u00b12.7 in the Zero-P group (p=0.442). These scores also worsened over time : 35.4\u00b13.8 and 36.8\u00b12.2 at the 12-month follow-up (p=0.165), respectively, and 34.7\u00b14.3 and 36.0\u00b12.3 at the 24 month follow-up (p=0.070), respectively. The difference between the immediate post-operative time point and the later follow-up results revealed a gradual worsening. Similar to aDH, the gap between the two groups widened as time passed, and the results of the last follow-up (the difference between the immediate post-operative and 24 month post-operative follow-ups) showed significant differences between the two groups, with a better outcome for the Zero-P group (p=0.033) ( Table 6).

ACDF is one of the most common surgical interventions performed by neurosurgeons. Overall complication rates reported for ACDF vary from 5% to 15% according to published studies 5,13) . ACDF with autologous bone graft and anterior plating has been the gold-standard operation for cervical degenerative spondylosis, including herniated nucleus pulposus 12,15,22) . Because of problems associated with the operation, such as autologous bone graft subsidence, donor site pain, dysphagia due to anterior plate and screw failure, stand-alone cages were developed [2][3][4]11,27) . The Cervios cage is one of these devices; it is designed to provide a scaffold for bony fusion and stability. The apparatus also restores the height of the disc space 2,4,6,9,11,27) .
