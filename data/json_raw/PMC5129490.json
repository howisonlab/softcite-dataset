Disease activity has been defined as the ongoing presence of urate deposits that lead to acute arthritis and joint damage. Every measure for each Outcome Measures in Rheumatology core domain was considered. A 3-step approach (factor analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and linear regression) was applied to derive the Gout Activity Score (GAS). Decision to change treatment or 6-month flare count were used as the surrogate criteria of high disease activity. Baseline and 12-month followup data of 446 patients included in the Kick-Off of the Italian Network for Gout cohort were used. Construct-and criterion-related validity were tested. External validation on an independent sample is reported. Results. Factor analysis identified 5 factors: patient-reported outcomes, joint examination, flares, tophi, and serum uric acid (sUA). Discriminant function analysis resulted in a correct classification of 79%. Linear regression analysis identified a first candidate GAS including 12-month flare count, sUA, visual analog scale (VAS) of pain, VAS global activity assessment, swollen and tender joint counts, and a cumulative measure of tophi. Alternative scores were also developed. The developed GAS demonstrated a good correlation with functional disability (criterion validity) and discrimination between patient-and physician-reported measures of active disease (construct validity). The results were reproduced in the external sample. Conclusion. This study developed and validated a composite measure of disease activity in gout. Further testing is required to confirm its generalizability, responsiveness, and usefulness in assisting with clinical decisions.",

Serum UA (sUA) approximates tissue levels well, and it is the main target of treatment in gout (2). The relevance of using sUA as the outcome measure in gout is strengthened by the consideration that drugs without influence on sUA do not have any plausible effect on the disease process (3). Furthermore, sUA levels associate with the risk of acute arthritis in a dose-dependent manner, and their persistent control leads to a reduction of tissue deposits and risk of flare (4). However, sUA is only weakly associated with other relevant outcomes, such as disability and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with gout (2).",

Beyond its clinical (and statistical) relevance, the main methodologic concerns rely on the face validity of the items to be included, the assumption of a compensation among items, and the relative response to treatment of single items within the composite score (7). Previous studies explored the relative relevance of items belonging to the OMERACT domains to be included in a composite outcome measure, showing substantial disagreement among clinicians, researchers, and patients (5,8,9). Nevertheless, more recently, a preliminary definition of remission has been proposed, suggesting the potential validity of measuring a state within the continuum of disease activity in gout (10).",

A 3-step method followed the methodology applied to other composite disease scores in rheumatic disease (19)(20)(21). Variables selected from the Delphi exercise were standardized. A factor analysis was then applied, and factors explaining more than 80% of the cumulative variance and eigenvalues .0.8 were retained. Factor loadings were then fitted in a linear discriminant function analysis, using the criterion of low/high disease activity as the classification rule. A classification table was used to evaluate the misclassification rates of the model. Discriminant scores were then computed for each subject and used as the dependent variable of a multivariate hierarchical linear regression analysis including transformed variables as regressors. The combination of variables explaining more than 0.95 of variation of the discriminant score were selected to be included in the final disease activity score for gout (Gout Activity Score [GAS]). Finally, beta coefficients were normalized and used to weight the transformed variables in order to compute the GAS at every time point.",

Experts then chose by consensus those measures that better defined the concept of disease activity compared to other related constructs, such as disease severity and general health: sUA, flares, patient-reported outcomes, tophi, and joint inflammation. The candidate items comply with the most important ones identified by other studies, as well as the novel definition of clinical remission for gout (3,5,10). The most relevant difference is the inclusion of joint inflammation and the exclusion of measures of function. These differences might be due to the fact that items were entirely derived from the experts and were specifically chosen to discriminate disease activity from other constructs, particularly disease severity. The inclusion of an extensive joint count might threaten the feasibility of our instrument. Also, because of the lack of gout-specific restricted joint count, GAS scores without joint count were developed. In the absence of fully validated goutspecific instruments for the evaluation of disability in gout (23), current instruments may potentially underestimate the impact of the disease on function (24). Similarly, the clinical measurement of tophi is not the most sensitive method available (e.g., ultrasonography, dual-energy computerized tomography), but is still the most feasible in clinical practice (13). Acute-phase reactants would be of interest as an additional item to be included, but because they are not routinely collected in gout databases they were excluded.",

            "text": "Despite the experts having reached a consensus about the most relevant measures to include in a composite disease activity score, this does not overcome the substantial lack of consensus among clinicians and patients about their relative importance, as shown by recent robust qualitative research (3,5). Building on these results, we applied a methodology to weight variables, following the approach proposed by van der Heijde et al in the first development of the disease activity score for rheumatoid arthritis (19). This is a data-driven approach that statistically identifies the combination of variables and their relative weights that best discriminate between disease states, using an external definition of active disease. In the absence of a gold-standard definition of active disease, by analogy from other disease activity measures, we opted for a relevant decision point in patient management: the moment when the rheumatologist considered gout sufficiently active that the patient had to start treatment with or switch to or increase the dose of urate-lowering drugs or symptomatic drugs. This choice reflects the perception of the physician of a poor control of the disease process. Such a reference standard described the real process of decision making in practice, because the rheumatologists were unaware that their therapeutic decisions were part of the investigation. The choice of this classification criterion for disease activity alone would be quite arbitrary and may be associated with a high misclassification. Alternatively, although the occurrence of flare has a high positive predictive value (almost 100%) in identifying active patients, all patients with no flares in the followup might be misclassified as \"not active.\" For this reason the performance of a score developed only on the risk of flare is likely to be insufficiently accurate. Based on statistical and conceptual considerations, we combined the \"treatment criterion\" and \"flare criterion\" in order to increase the performance of classification and to cover all the aspects of our definition of disease activity. Sensitivity analyses support the robustness of this approach, showing only a slight decrease of weight for sUA and increase for joint inflammation in the scores developed using only \"treatment criterion\" as the classification rule. Using the KING data set it was possible to develop the GAS because of the prospective followup of a large number of patients, belonging to the entire spectrum of disease and with a large number of variables prospectively collected. This is a rheumatology practice-based multicenter cohort that ensures high reliability in the assessment but selection of more severe or refractory disease. Of note, we included a relatively higher proportion of men than expected in a general population sample (25). Further validation in a primary care setting is worthwhile to define its generalizability.",
