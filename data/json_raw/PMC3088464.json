            "text": "Background: Quality improvement (QI) initiatives characterised by iterative cycles of quantitative data analysis do not readily explain the organisational determinants of change. However, the integration of sociotechnical theory can inform more effective strategies. Our specific aims were to (1) describe a computerised decision support intervention intended to improve adherence with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis recommendations; and (2) show how sociotechnical theory expressed in 'Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology' framework (FITT) can identify and clarify the facilitators and barriers to QI work. Methods: A multidisciplinary team developed and implemented electronic menus with DVT prophylaxis recommendations. Stakeholders were interviewed and human factors were analysed to optimise integration. Menu exposure, order placement and clinical performance were measured. Vista tool extraction and chart review were used. Performance compliance preimplementation was 77%. Results: There were 80e110 eligible cases per month. Initial menu use rate was 20%. After barriers were classified and addressed using the FITT framework, use improved 50% to 90%. Tasks, users and technology issues in the FITT model and their interfaces were identified and addressed. Workflow styles, concerns about validity of guidelines, cycle times and perceived ambiguity of risk were issues identified. Conclusions: DVT prophylaxis in a surgical setting is fraught with socio-political agendas, cognitive dissonance and misaligned expectations. These must be sought and articulated if organisations are to respond to internal resistance to change. This case study demonstrates that QI teams using information technology must understand the clinical context, even in mature electronic health record environments, in order to implement sustainable systems.",

            "text": "In modern healthcare's knowledge-intensive environment, information technology (IT) is frequently incorporated into quality improvement (QI) initiatives to narrow provider knowledge gaps and influence the trajectory of behaviour. 1 It follows then that implementation specialists introducing new technology and computerised decision support (CDS) tend to use quality improvement methods popularised by Deming (ie, the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle) and Donabedian (ie, Structure-Process-Outcome (SPO) framework). 2e4 These models improve the rigour of an implementation by emphasising mechanisms of cause and effect and expressing performance outcomes quantitatively. However, QI initiatives are by their very nature, multi-dimensional and context dependent; the impact of technology on performance is often a function of the organisational culture as much as the technology or the systems-of-care. 5 Unfortunately, most QI models incompletely capture complex, heterogeneous and culturally textured healthcare systems activities. 6 7 In contrast, sociotechnical approaches drawn from the behavioural sciences explore the organisational and cultural interdependencies that influence technology adoption by incorporating facets of informatics, cognitive theory and organisational behaviour. 6 8e14 Notably, Ammenwerth and colleagues have developed the 'Fit between Individuals, Task and Technology' framework (FITT), which expresses system change through the match between user group attributes, characteristics of the implemented technology, and affected tasks (figure 1). 9 This framework may be used as a heuristic to inform more effective and durable quality interventions. 15 The purpose of this manuscript is to show how qualitative assessment of organisational context can complement a QI implementation using information technology. Our specific aims are to (1) describe a CDS intervention intended to improve adherence with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis recommendations; (2) show how sociotechnical theory expressed in the FITT framework can help identify the facilitators and the barriers to adoption of new systems and (3) demonstrate how qualitative data categorised using the FITT model can complement the quantitative analysis characteristic of the PDSA model.",

Nationally conducted chart reviews showed that patients either did not receive prophylaxis or received non-standard prophylaxis 75% of the time. Consequently, hospital executive leadership and the surgical department jointly sponsored the development and implementation of health record CDS and an educational campaign to encourage surgeon compliance with DVT prophylaxis recommendations.",

We classified findings according to the components of the FITT framework (ie, user, technology, task) and the interfaces between components (table 1). The most important barriers identified included the presence of accessory or work-around pathways in CPRS, poor order set usability and misalignment between CDS recommendations and pre-existing surgical care patterns. Moreover, provider workflow was non-linear, and highly adaptive, affording ample opportunity to bypass our clinical pathways and recommended guidelines. When clinical pathways were used, providers initially struggled with the order sets. Surgeons had increased order entry time and a decrease in productivity. Focus group respondents argued that patient risk stratification guidelines were frequently not prescriptive enough to effectively apply to individual patients at the point-ofcare. Finally, many providers disagreed with the clinical guidelines, arguing that the risk of hemarthrosis outweighed the potential protection pharmacologic prophylaxis afforded against fatal PE.",

There appeared to be a gradual increase in order use over time; the trend lines show three general trajectories (figure 5), a slow adoption rate after the first PDSA cycle, a second more rapid adoption rate after the second PDSA cycle and a third gradual rise over the last two quarters. We believe that technical design changes (eg, removal of accessory order pathways) were responsible for the rapid increase in utilisation between the first and the second cycle. The team identified several technical problems with the CDS that disrupted workflow or limited usability. These issues were partially design related and partially related to the limitations of the legacy electronic record (eg, VistA/ CPRS does not support complex branched logic). We suspect that the more gradual trajectories of performance improvement were a reflection of slower socio-organisational change including new learning, peer-to-peer influences and socio-political forces. Although we sought to accelerate this process using multi-modal educational campaigns, these strategies appeared to be only marginally effective. In circumstances where surgeons were unfamiliar with patient risk categories and prophylaxis options, teaching initiatives or menu revision proved useful. Conversely, surgeons with firmly established practice patterns or expressing concerns about anticoagulation risks strongly resisted change.",

Conversely, organisational change theories popularised by Rogers propose explanations for how groups adopt innovations across large-scale organisations. 30 Rogers diffusion of innovation theory describes several key organisational and technologic determinants of systemic change: (1) the characteristics of the technology, (2) users' readiness for change and (3) the organisational structure. When introducing new technology for the purposes of QI, it is important to explore entrenched stakeholder belief systems using exploratory methods and engage target users before applying incremental changes. By systematically studying the sociotechnical system, the implementation scientist can rationally choose interventions that accelerate improvement, limit resource expenditure and optimise the sociotechnical fit.",

Although, we cite several technical changes that we hypothesise had a direct impact on the rate of menu use, it is equally likely that the sigmoidal pattern of uptake, in part, reflects the recruitment of different user types along the adoption continuum. Engaging service chiefs and senior residents was critical for identifying improvement opportunities, gaining political capital within the OCD and developing internal momentum to promote menu use.",

By striving to understand the barriers affecting activity system components and the interfaces between them, we were able to develop a plan that addressed user needs, implement an intervention that articulated with workflow, study the contextual determinants of performance, and act in alignment with stakeholder expectations. To our knowledge, this is the first report applying the FITT framework to a QI intervention and suitably captures the human-centred issues intrinsic to QI work. It enriched our QI methods by clarifying the basis of user resistance and highlighting the relationship between organisational attributes and outcomes. The framework draws strategies from the cognitive sciences, anthropology and applied informatics, which in turn, helped inform better overall design. Despite the robustness of the FITT model to understand user acceptance of technology, it is not the only one reported in the health informatics literature. 8 31e35 Most models are complementary, though few have been empirically tested in multiple settings and none have emerged as superior. Although the FITT model establishes an approach to assess the readiness of an organisation to adopt change and the specific facets deserving of study, it may not be suitable for all implementation efforts. For example, the framework may incompletely model the exchange of new information between unlike users in a heterogeneous clinician cohort. Also, the framework does not explicitly focus upon organisational behaviour and, therefore, may incompletely capture the cultural differences at the organisational, team or unit level. 8 Finally, the model was based on analysis of the literature and aimed at new technology implementations. It may be less capable of detecting sociotechnical barriers in sites where clinicians use mature electronic record systems with embedded CDS. In our case study, it is notable that many barriers were not identified until the second QI cycle. Many sociotechnical issues were deeply entrenched in the activity system and only recognised in an applied setting possibly because (1) end users may not be positioned to articulate technology requirements, (2) cognitive dissonance and cultural resiliency are best observed in context, and (3) FITT dimensions are dynamic and tend to evolve in response to system change. 7 9 There are several limitations to this study that deserve mention. First, time series methods lack randomised controls or blinding and are sensitive to bias. Second, the team only examined a single medical centre. Hence, our results may not be generalisable. Finally, the time and resource constraints typical of quality improvement work limited our ability to gather qualitative data. We did not digitally record and code clinical activity or user narratives. Instead, we relied upon ethnographic survey techniques and field notes.",

First, the model has not been well tested in diverse healthcare settings and, to our knowledge, has never been tested in a QI domain. Hence, it should be applied to other QI initiatives in a variety of healthcare contexts to ascertain its relevance to other CDS interventions and clinical sub-cultures. Second, the model is a theoretical representation of many co-existing processes and sub-cultures. Consequently, it may oversimplify or incompletely capture the complex healthcare activity system with sufficient granularity to model all the drivers of change. Finally, the model does not take into account the axis of time. As we stated before, the introduction of innovations into a system can have profound and complex social effects. Hence, it may be important to capture the organisational-state pre-implementation and track the evolution of state as work practices shift to reinforce the cultural norms threatened by new technology. For example, the framework did not explicitly articulate any transient socio-political phenomena, when, in fact, the facility did not have an identified section chief for Orthopaedics at the time of implementation.

This report shows one potential approach to synthesising the complementary disciplines of QI and sociotechnical theory. Although rationalist improvement methodologies appropriately emphasise a data-driven ethic, sociotechnical heuristics such as the FITT model invoke social science discourse to explain the 'why' as much as the 'what' or 'how' of system design. Hidden socio-political agendas, dissonant cognitive frameworks, and misalignment of expectations must be articulated if organisations are to identify and respond intelligently to internal resistance to change. Furthermore, this case study demonstrates that QI teams leveraging information technology must possess a nuanced understanding of context, even in mature electronic health record environments, if they expect to implement durable and sustainable change.",
