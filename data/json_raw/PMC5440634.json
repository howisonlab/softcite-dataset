            "text": "Introduction: Vaginismus is mostly unknown among clinicians and women. Vaginismus causes women to have fear, anxiety, and pain with penetration attempts. Aim: To present a large cohort of patients based on prior published studies approved by an institutional review board and the Food and Drug Administration using a comprehensive multimodal vaginismus treatment program to treat the physical and psychologic manifestations of women with vaginismus and to record successes, failures, and untoward effects of this treatment approach. Methods: Assessment of vaginismus included a comprehensive pretreatment questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and consultation. All patients signed a detailed informed consent. Treatment consisted of a multimodal approach including intravaginal injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) and bupivacaine, progressive dilation under conscious sedation, indwelling dilator, follow-up and support with office visits, phone calls, e-mails, dilation logs, and FSFI reports. Main Outcome Measures: Logs noting dilation progression, pain and anxiety scores, time to achieve intercourse, setbacks, and untoward effects. Post-treatment FSFI scores were compared with preprocedure scores. Results: One hundred seventy-one patients (71%) reported having pain-free intercourse at a mean of 5.1 weeks (median \u00bc 2.5). Six patients (2.5%) were unable to achieve intercourse within a 1-year period after treatment and 64 patients (26.6%) were lost to follow-up. The change in the overall FSFI score measured at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year was statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Three patients developed mild temporary stress incontinence, two patients developed a short period of temporary blurred vision, and one patient developed temporary excessive vaginal dryness. All adverse events resolved by approximately 4 months. One patient required retreatment followed by successful coitus. Conclusion: A multimodal program that treated the physical and psychologic aspects of vaginismus enabled women to achieve pain-free intercourse as noted by patient communications and serial female sexual function studies. Further studies are indicated to better understand the individual components of this multimodal treatment program.",

            "text": "Vaginismus is a subset of the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and is currently defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition as a penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration such as tampons, digit, vaginal dilators, gynecologic (GYN) examinations, and intercourse is often painful or impossible. 1 Genito-pelvic pain/ penetration disorder further collapses dyspareunia and vaginismus into one entity. 2 Based on data that spasm is not always present in vaginismus, 3 Basson et al 4 proposed an alternative definition of persistent or recurrent difficulties in vaginal entry of a penis, finger, or other object despite the desire to do so. Vaginismus is a psychologic disorder manifested by fear and anxiety to penetration 5 and a physical disorder as noted by vaginal spasm 6,7 and is distinct from other sexual pain disorders such as vulvodynia or vestibulodynia. 7 The diagnosis of vaginismus is made by history. 7 Women who cannot tolerate a GYN examination might have an examination under anesthesia during which any vaginal spasm disappears. Then, the patient is told that the examination was \"normal.\" After one such patient was hospitalized for a suicide attempt, another patient told her parents she was going to commit suicide. Symptoms of vaginismus vary according to the severity of vaginismus. Symptoms include fear, anxiety, and pain of vaginal penetration; inability to use a tampon (often noted at a young age); inability to remove a tampon that gets \"stuck\" (the proximal portion of the tampon swells with blood and cannot be extracted through the area of introital spasm, at times necessitating removal under anesthesia); severe pain with penetration; complaints that attempted intercourse is like \"hitting a wall\"; and an inability to tolerate a GYN examination. These symptoms help differentiate vaginismus from vulvodynia and provoked vestibulodynia and are suggestive of spasm at the level of the introitus. 6e8 Vaginismus can be mild, in which different treatment approaches are effective, or severe, making treatment difficult. 6,7 The findings of vaginal spasm support other studies that have noted active vaginal contractions in response to stimuli. 9,10 Compared with other sexual pain disorders such as vulvodynia and vestibulodynia, the treatment of vaginismus has potential for a high rate of success. 6e8, 11,12 Stratifying the severity of vaginismus helps the clinician choose among numerous treatment options to better understand what the patient is experiencing and what she is capable of doing. 6e8,13 We have noted that women with milder forms of vaginismus can cooperate with different treatment suggestions, whereas women who are terrified by any attempted vaginal penetration have difficulty following treatment suggestions. 6e8 Reasons for sexual pain such as herpes virus, lichen sclerosis, and other medical conditions need to be ruled out as a source of sexual pain, as do vulvodynia and vestibulodynia. 14 Despite its description more than a century ago, 15 vaginismus is rarely taught in medical school, residency training, and medical meetings. 7 Vaginismus can be categorized as primary, in which the patient has never experienced non-painful intercourse, or secondary, in which the patient has previously experienced nonpainful intercourse but subsequently experiences pain. 16 The prevalence rate of vaginismus in a clinical setting has been estimated as 5% to 17%, and it is believed to be one of the more prevalent female sexual dysfunctions. 17 Different psychological factors have been associated with vaginismus, such as traumatic sexual experiences, sexual abuse, a strict religious and/or strict sexual upbringing, fear and/or anxiety issues, 18,19 and being held down at a young age during catheterization or enemas, 7 but it is not always associated with psychological issues and some patients give a negative history for those factors.",

This is an important part of your evaluation. Baseline patient demographics and condition characteristics are listed in Table 1. The average age was 30 years (range \u00bc 17e72) with an average duration of vaginismus of 7.8 years (range \u00bc 1e37) from time of discovery. In filling out their questionnaires, 168 patients (70%) noted they had Lamont level 4 or Pacik level 5 at baseline, indicating severe vaginismus. Only 58.5% of women reported penetration with a finger and only 50% could complete a GYN examination. Fewer than 40% of patients could use tampons and only 83 patients (34%) reported attempts at intercourse. Patients who attempted coitus remarked that it was extremely painful or impossible and often further noted that only the tip of the penis could be inserted, which suggests penetration as far as the vestibule but not intravaginal. Table 2 lists prior treatments and coping strategies. Of note is the large number of women who attempted different treatments during a span of many years. Patients had a mean of 4 \u00b1 2.7 failed treatments, with the most common being lubricants and dilator use (attempted by 74% and 73% of patients, respectively). The many failed treatment attempts are consistent with the severity of vaginismus noted in this group of women with vaginismus.     ",

Using a pediatric speculum and bending the needle to 30 , Botox 50 U (20 injections \u00bc 1 mL) was injected into the right bulbospongiosum and Botox 50 U (1 mL) was injected into the left side into the lateral submucosal areas of the introitus, marked by the residual hymenal fragments, at 7 to 9'clock on the patient's right and 3 to 5 o'clock on her left (Figure 3). A headlight is needed for the procedure. Injections are delivered above, into, and below the hymenal fragments on each side to include the full width of the bulbospongiosum. Intramuscular injections were found to be unnecessary and caused more bleeding. (Botox is known to diffuse approximately 1 cm from the injection site.) When other areas of spasm or tightness of the levator ani were identified, an additional 50 U was injected in similar divided doses submucosally into the affected muscles.",

No injections were delivered anteriorly or posteriorly to help avoid urinary and rectal incontinence. Conscious sedation was needed during vaginal injections and dilation, although, rarely, women with less severe vaginismus tolerated the procedure with no sedation. The patient was progressively dilated with the #4 dilator (3-inch circumference), the #5 dilator (4-inch circumference), and then, when possible, the #6 dilator (5-inch circumference) and reassessed with digital examination. Sometimes it was physically impossible to insert the #6 dilator. Approximately 10% to 15% of women required release of a constricting hymenal ring noted to be present around the circumference of the introitus (not to be confused with an intact hymen) with a small snip or the removal of a small triangular wedge on the left and right lateral sides of the ring. This procedure results in a small amount of bleeding that can be controlled with pressure. Hymenectomy was not needed in any of the patients. The procedure was concluded with bimanual examination and reinsertion of a #5 or #6 indwelling dilator, and the patient was awakened and transported to the recovery area (Figure 4). Operative time was approximately 30 minutes. As a private certified OR, partners were allowed to observe the treatment if the patient gave consent. Partners were shown the degree of spasm and with a glove were able to palpate the spasm. During the procedure, they were instructed how to insert the dilators to help with postprocedure dilation (this helped the woman overcome some of her \"control issues\"). The breakthrough for many of these men observing the procedure was often profound and allowed them to understand, often for the first time, that vaginismus is a medical condition over which the woman had no control.",

These group sessions often took approximately 5 hours, which also allowed the participants to ask questions. Counseling included postprocedure instructions for dilator use, lubricants, and progression to coitus (Appendix 3). 7,8 Rarely a patient requested private counseling, which was done in a separate part of the building. Women with vaginismus, especially those with severe vaginismus, usually are sexually inexperienced; their fears and heightened anxiety to penetration persist. Some women exchanged e-mails and phone numbers. This was helpful in maintaining a support system. Postdischarge dilation recommendations are presented in Appendix 4. When applicable, patients were encouraged to continue seeing their clinicians such as psychologists, sex counselors, and physical therapists for ongoing care and support.  Table 1, more than 50% of women attempted the use of dilators and were unable to progress to comfortable penetration because, too often, not enough time was spent dilating. Regardless of the type of treatment, dilation is an important part of the recovery process. Women have mentioned repeatedly that they hate to dilate and even patients who went through this rigorous program sometimes failed to dilate for long enough periods.

During these first attempts at intercourse, patients and their partners are taught to penetrate with no more than the penile tip because women with severe vaginismus are fragile at this juncture and often have considerable fear. Men also are vulnerable in that erectile dysfunction might be noted including loss of erection and premature ejaculation. Everything possible is done to help remove the pressure of this moment. Once penile tip penetration is achieved comfortably, the couple can advance to full penetration; however, thrusting is discouraged because this can be a setback for the woman. Women with severe vaginismus might note \"leg lock,\" the involuntary closure of the thighs in anticipation of penetration. The \"spooning position\" with entry from behind has been found to be helpful in overcoming leg lock.

(i) Although severe vaginismus can be difficult to treat and treatment failures are common, this group of women had a rapid response to treatment. (ii) Stratifying the severity of vaginismus allowed us to properly support these women, many who had multiple prior failed treatments and had high levels of fear and anxiety. (iii) The multimodal nature of this program treated the psychologic fear and anxiety and the physical vaginal spasm. (iv) Giving these patients our personal contact information helped support them. (v) Some patients who showed no improvement after Botox injections elsewhere did not have counseling or support. Some had multiple attempts at Botox injections with continued failure. (vi) Vaginismus is not a surgical problem. Hymenectomy and episiotomy are inappropriate treatments for this condition. (vii) The clinician needs to be aware of the many secondary challenges these women face and to be prepared for ongoing treatment or referrals. These include residual fear and anxiety for penetration, 7,25,26 inability to progress to intercourse despite using dilators, 7 low libido 26 (sometimes of both partners), heightened harm avoidance and pain catastrophizing, 27 disgust issues, 28 anorgasmia, partner solicitousness and hostility, 29 infidelity, and erectile dysfunction. 7 We hypothesize that the insertion of dilators under conscious sedation at the time of Botox and bupivacaine injections, counseling, and post-treatment support provide the initial breakthrough that allows the patient to realize that pain-free penetration is possible and that her anatomy is normal. 30 The chemodenervation of Botox injections takes effect approximately 2 to 7 days after injection and lasts for approximately 4 months. 7 This gives these women adequate time to advance with their dilators and progress to intercourse. Women are not aware when the Botox is no longer active. Some women do not achieve intercourse for at least 1 year yet can be successful if they continue dilating.",

During the past 20 years, Dr Pacik has treated thousands of patients using Botox for dynamic facial wrinkles, excessive sweating, migraine headaches, and vaginismus, with only rare minor untoward effects mostly the result of migration of Botox to nearby tissues. At the time of Dr Pacik's retirement, 391 women (of 555 inquiries) were treated using this program with few minor untoward events such as temporary mild stress incontinence. No permanent sequelae were noted. This treatment program can be added to the armamentarium of a GYN practice. Treating these desperate women can be one of the highlights in a career dedicated to helping others (Appendix 6).",

A large cohort of women with vaginismus participated in the study. This multimodal treatment approach appears to treat the physical and psychologic manifestations of vaginismus, demonstrating a high rate of success and safety and a low recurrence rate, and has demonstrated successful pain-free intercourse in patients who have had long-term failures with other types of treatment for vaginismus. There were no major complications and few minor untoward effects in this study.",

            "text": "1. An important weakness in this study was the lack of comparison treatment. This multimodal vaginismus treatment approach included injections of Botox and bupivacaine, dilation under anesthesia, the use of an indwelling dilator during recovery, and postprocedure counseling and support and suggests the need for a larger placebo-controlled clinical trial to better understand the role of each of the components. This was not possible in this cohort study because of the widespread geographic distribution of patients who could not be followed with office visits, resulting in incomplete postprocedure data and patients lost to follow-up. 2. As a cohort study, findings should be interpreted within the limits of this design. 3. Although patients were encouraged to submit FSFIs with Dr Pacik at 3, 6, and 12 months, some data of successful advancement with dilators and progression to intercourse were delivered by e-mail logs, which could be prone to interview bias. 4. The diverse geographic locations of patients obviated pre-and post-electromyographic studies, which could have been helpful in the assessment and follow-up. Women with severe vaginismus generally cannot participate with electromyographic studies as noted by the physical therapists who treated some of these patients. 5. The references cited using onabotulinumtoxinA injections did not include limitations in their respective discussions. 6. A \"quality of life\" survey would have been helpful in this study to compare pretreatment with post-treatment outcomes. 7. The study was conducted in the setting of a private practice. A university setting would be helpful so that participants could be followed more closely.",
