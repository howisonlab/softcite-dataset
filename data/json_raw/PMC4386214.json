Method: This pilot study used a pre-post design using a historical control. Setting: Two PICUs at different hospitals in an Australian metropolitan city. Participants: Patients admitted to the PICU and ventilated for \u226524 h, aged more than 1 month and not admitted for seizure management or terminal care. Intervention: Guidelines for sedation and analgesia management for critically ill children including algorithm and assessment tools. Outcome variables: In addition to key outcome variables (ventilation time, medication dose and duration, length of stay), feasibility outcomes data (recruitment, data collection, safety) were evaluated. Guideline adherence was assessed through chart audit and staff were surveyed about merit and the use of guidelines. Results: The guidelines were trialled for a total of 12 months on 63 patients and variables compared with the historical control group (n=75). Analysis revealed differences in median Morphine infusion duration between groups (pretest 3.63 days (87 h) vs post-test 2.83 days (68 h), p=0.05) and maximum doses (pretest 120 \u03bcg/kg/h vs post-test 97.5 \u03bcg/kg/h) with no apparent change to ventilation duration. Chart audit revealed varied use of tools, but staff were positive about the guidelines and their use in practice. Conclusions: The sedation guidelines impacted on the duration and dosage of agents without any apparent impact on ventilation duration or length of stay. Furthermore, the guidelines appeared to be feasible and acceptable in clinical practice. The results of the study have laid the foundation for follow-up studies in withdrawal from sedation, point prevalence and longitudinal studies of sedation practices as well as drug trial work."

The main indications for their use include: to reduce patient pain, anxiety and agitation, induce amnesia, facilitate mechanical ventilation, prevent the displacement of endotracheal tubes, and decrease cellular metabolism. [1][2][3] The detrimental impact of poor sedation practices intensive care units (ICUs) has increasingly become a focus for researcher and clinicians. The impetus for this stem from concerns about under-sedation and over-sedation. 4 Both under-sedation and oversedation have the potential to lead to agitated patients with compromised short-term safety issues and impact on duration of ventilation and length of stay (LOS). 5 6 The consequences of prolonged use of sedative and analgesic agents in the ICU patient include central nervous system activation, gastrointestinal disturbances and sympathetic hyperactivity. These signs and symptoms have been related to tolerance and withdrawal phenomena and also hold implications for the patient's physical and psychological well-Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa Detailed outline of the guideline development process based on the consensus paper and available evidence. \u25aa Original dual site feasibility ( pilot) study testing the impact of guidelines on patient, quality and practice outcomes. \u25aa Generation of clinical and trial process data to inform future trial work. \u25aa No firm evidence or 'cause and effect' can be concluded due to the pre/post study design and small sample size.",

The key recommendations of the guidelines developed and tested in this study were based on the key recommendations in the 2006 consensus paper which are summarised in table 1. 12 A range of non-pharmacological strategies to minimise patient stress and pain and optimise comfort are supported by varying levels of evidence ranging from case studies to Cochrane systematic reviews. These were not new strategies, but it was important to incorporate them into the guidelines to promote a holistic approach to pain and sedation management and reflect the recommendations of the consensus guidelines. Strategies recommended were aimed at moderating the PICU environment where possible (ie, minimising highintensity light and noise, ensuring rest periods); 21 22 minimising discomfort of invasive devices; regular repositioning and limb support with pillows, pressure relieving devices or swaddling; 23 24 monitoring and optimising hydration, nutrition and essential cares (eg, oral and eye care); supporting parental visitation and reassurance as well as therapeutic (non-technical) touch. 25 26 New assessment scales for behavioural state, pain and withdrawal assessment were integral to the guidelines. These included the State Behaviour Scale (SBS), 27 28 the Multidisciplinary Assessment of Pain Scale (MAPS) [29][30][31][32] and the Opioid Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Assessment Scale (WAS). 33 34 The three phases of sedation (acute, plateau and weaning) management were derived from patterns observed in a retrospective audit conducted earlier by the research team 35 36 and from the literature. 9 12 37-39 The guidelines reflect the dynamic nature of a PICU patient's admission and allow for movement between and within phases according to the patient's need, response and condition.",

They are typically used in combination as together they have a synergistic effect that often allows for use of lower doses. Midazolam doses can be reduced as much as 30-50% when combined with an opioid. 41 Nonetheless, prolonged and/or heavy sedation persists in critical care units, and as a result tolerance and withdrawal syndrome complicate recovery.",

This approach is based on the principles of narcotic withdrawal where withdrawal syndrome is managed by conversion to an orally active drug with a longer half-life (such as methadone or diazepam) that has a more steady state serum concentration, more readily facilitating a slow tapering of the drug and minimising the severity of withdrawal symptoms or i. The potential for opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome should be considered after 7 days of continuous therapy ii. When subsequently discontinued, the doses of these agents may need to be routinely tapered even development of the withdrawal syndrome. [43][44][45][46] The advantages of methadone are an oral bioavailability of 75-80%, allowing for oral administration, and a prolonged half-life of 12-24 h, allowing twice daily administration (ibid). There is a general reluctance to use diazepam for critically ill patients because of its long elimination and concerns about excessive and prolonged sedation. However, similar to methadone, diazepam's long-acting active metabolites theoretically should result in small changes in serum drug concentrations and may decrease fluctuations in sedation state and therefore be a more appropriate agent for long-term sedated patients. 39 The formal acknowledgement of a sedation weaning phase with a dedicated assessment tool and tapering regime was new practice for the study units. No validated opioid or benzodiazepine weaning schedule was found; however, a consensus of opinion across the literature supports a daily reduction of 5-10% or an initial reduction of 20-40%, followed by a 10% reduction once or twice daily, depending on the patient response. 39 47 The protocol for sedation weaning incorporated into these guidelines approximated these recommendations.",

It was important to establish that the outcomes were not adversely affected by the guidelines before considering larger and more extensive trial work. Feasibility data outcomes included the success of screening and recruitment strategies; data collection and entry processes; confirmation of Research Nurse time and cost, and produced further estimates of ventilation times and medication dosing, which can be used to finalise sample size requirements for the larger trial, and inform funding applications for same. Potentially confounding variables collected included patient age, gender, diagnosis and the Paediatric Index of Mortality (PIM2) as a measure of acuity. Nurses in the study setting routinely collect and record standard demographic and biophysiological patient measurements on the local computerised information system. The revised PIM2 is a simple model of mortality in PICU based on admission data and uses 10 explanatory variables. 48 Post-implementation compliance/fidelity was assessed by chart review using an audit tool based on the 19 key components of the guidelines. Adherence to 75% of the key components overall and then within each phase was nominally chosen as the minimum acceptable value for fidelity at this stage. However, the results whatever they were would inform any future implementation processes and trial work. Nursing staff perceptions of the guidelines were ascertained through administration of a researcher-developed survey with questions on ease of use, impact on practice, perceived benefit, facilitation of team management and promotion of nurse autonomy at the bedside.

Ultimately, there were 75 in the control group and 63 in the post-implementation group. Data were analysed on a per-protocol basis. Figure 1 demonstrates the sampling framework and exclusion criteria. Table 2 shows the main characteristics measured for each sample. Both groups were comparable with no significant differences between age, weight, sex or reason for admission. There were also no differences identified between the TVT and LOS for each group. There were no incidents of accidental extubation or readmission within 48 h for participants in either group for the study. Table 3 shows the different drug characteristics between groups, demonstrating a greater variance in drug usage. The decrease of 19 h in the median infusion time of morphine between groups approached significance (87 vs 68 h, p=0.059).

The observed increases in median minimum and maximum doses of morphine and midazolam do not appear to be associated with an increase in patient TVT or LOS, and in fact the duration of each infusion was reduced. Similar changes in medication administration have been observed in other PICU guideline studies.

Allows for uniform/consistent decision-making \u25b8 Empowers and rationalises nursing changes in sedation \u25b8 Everyone using the same guide should translate to more consistent care. There is more autonomy for nurses, particularly with less experienced registrars. It potentially irons out variations in individual consultant preferences \u25b8 It has increased the awareness among staff and prompts discussion \u25b8 It places importance on sedation and assists nurses to provide better sedation. Patients more comfortable equals parents more comfortable Limitations \u25b8 Can be complicated because of the amount of detail \u25b8 Needs definitions and differential diagnoses for each of the phases \u25b8 Not all patients fit the guidelines or respond as predicted \u25b8 Requires full concentration with attention to detail and practice to become familiar \u25b8 Lack of medical leadership/ownership shared \u25b8 Difficult to continue in ward, particularly with weaning \u25b8 Have trouble with some long-term patients following the guidelines and keeping them comfortable research variable.

The adoption score for the withdrawal phase was the lowest of the three phases, which may have resulted from less familiarity and knowledge with the tool and phase. This is consistent with findings found in a review of similar studies. 51 Suggested reasons for non-adherence included complexity of the guideline or algorithm, staff not valuing or understanding the goal of the guideline and perceived redundancy of the guideline if the staff were already competent practitioners in this area (ibid). Potential solutions to these issues included ongoing staff education and timely feedback related to the guideline to continuously reinforce importance, ease of use and troubleshoot issues. 52 In addition to surveying staff opinion, it is also important to conduct periodic chart audits to quantify guideline fidelity. This will help minimise self-report bias as was reflected somewhat in this study. 53 Staff perceptions of guideline principles and use were positive, although the level of adherence was variable. So the full impact of the guidelines was not realised.",

Full adoption of all phases and tools in the guidelines was not realised and this has implications for ongoing implementation and larger trial work. Additionally, the small response rate and selective population for the survey may introduce some bias in the current understanding of staff acceptance of the guidelines. A more inclusive (medical and nursing) survey population is recommended for follow-up research. Conducting the study in two units assists with the generalisability of the study and its results. Some specifics of the guidelines and algorithm, however, might need modification to reflect local practice, for example, use of different drugs (fentanyl instead of morphine) and different patient populations ( post cardiothoracic surgery)."

Weaning from sedation agents and the concept of withdrawal appear to be areas of practice that need more attention. The researchers went on to trial and evaluate a revised withdrawal assessment tool and a study comparing the outcomes of dexmedetomidine versus midazolam is about to start. The study units plan to continue to use the guidelines and tools in their modified form pending the results of a larger trial work recently completed in the USA. The modern ICU is an important focus for quality improvement efforts. Guidelines cannot automatically guarantee improved quality of care; however, they do direct the clinician in the pursuit of this objective, particularly when supported by high-level evidence."

Any correctable environmental and physical factors causing discomfort should be addressed alongside the introduction of pharmacological agents ii. A normal pattern of sleep should be encouraged. Attention should be paid to lighting, environmental noise and temporal orientation of patients 2. Pain assessment and analgesic management i. All critically ill children have the right to adequate relief of their pain. Local and regional anaesthetic techniques should be considered. A patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device may be useful in older children ii. Pain assessment should be performed regularly by using a scale appropriate to the age of the patient and routinely documented. The level of pain reported by the patient must be considered the current standard of analgesia. Patients who cannot communicate should be assessed for the presence of pain-related behaviours and physiological indicators of pain. A therapeutic plan for analgesia should be established for each patient and regularly reviewed iii. Recommended pharmacological agents for analgesia include opioids (eg, morphine, fentanyl) for the relief of severe pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for moderately severe pain, and paracetamol for mild to The level of sedation should be regularly assessed and documented using a validated and age-appropriate sedation assessment scale. The desired level of sedation should be identified for each patient and regularly reassessed. Doses of sedative agents should be titrated to produce the desired level of sedation iii. Recommended pharmacological agents for sedation include midazolam or clonidine. Early use of enteral sedative agents (eg, chloral hydrate, promethazine) is recommended. Propofol should not be used to provide continuous sedation in critically ill children 4. Withdrawal syndrome assessment, prevention and management"
