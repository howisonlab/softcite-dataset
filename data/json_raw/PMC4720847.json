A better understanding of the pathologic characteristics of the CTO lesion may helpful to improving CTO PCI success rates. We evaluated the CTO lesion in patients with stable angina (SA) by virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS). Subjects and Methods: The study population consisted of 149 consecutive patients with SA underwent VH-IVUS examination. We analyzed demographic and VH-IVUS findings in 22 CTO patients (17 males; mean, 62.3 years old) compared with 127 non-CTO patients (82 males; mean, 61.3 years old). Results: A significantly lower ejection fraction (57.6\u00b113.0% vs. 65.4\u00b18.8%, p=0.007) was detected in the CTO group compared with the non-CTO group. Reference vessel lumen area of the proximal and distal segment was significantly less in CTO group than in non-CTOgroup. The lesion length of the CTO group was significantly longer than those of the non-CTO group (24.4\u00b19.6 mm vs. 17.2\u00b17.4 mm, p<0.001). Total atheroma volume (224\u00b1159 mm 3 vs. 143\u00b186 mm 3 , p=0.006) and percent atheroma volume (63.2\u00b19.6% vs. 55.8\u00b18.5%, p=0.011) of the CTO group were also significantly greater than those of non-CTO group. However, the lesion length adjusted plaque composition of the CTO group was not significantly different compared with that of the non-CTO group. Conclusion: CTO lesions had a longer lesion length and greater plaque burden than the non-CTO lesion in patients with SA. However, lesion length adjusted plaque composition showed similar between the two groups. These results support that plaque characteristics of CTO lesions are similar to non-CTO lesions in patients with SA.",

[2][3][4][5] CTO percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can decrease or eliminate symptoms. 6)7) Successful PCI performed on a CTO lesion can decrease the need for anti-anginal medications, improve exercise capacity, 8) decrease the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), improve left ventricular systolic function, 9) decrease the risk for arrhythmias, 10) and improve overall survival of patients. 7) There have been significant improvements in procedure techniques for CTO PCI in recent years, and success rates for CTO PCI have risen to greater than 80 to 90%. Major complication rates of CTO PCI are acceptable and similar to non-CTO PCI. 1) Interventional cardiologists typically hypothesize that calcium deposition within and around the CTO segment is a primary cause of CTO PCI failure, particularly during wiring.",

The CTO group was defined as an obstruction of a native coronary artery with no luminal continuity and TIMI flow grade 0 and with an estimated occlusion duration of three months or more. The occlusion duration was determined by the interval from the first diagnostic coronary angiogram documenting a CTO or from the duration of ischemic symptoms in patients that had not previously undergone angiography. 11) The control group was composed of patients with SA according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification.

However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of remodeling index, plaque area, plaque burden, plaque components, and percent plaque composition. The minimal lumen area of the CTO group, which was measured after ballooning, was similar to the non-CTO group (3.67\u00b11.05 mm 2 vs. 4.08\u00b11.52 mm 2 , p=0.264).

We found that lesion length and plaque burden of the CTO group were significantly longer and greater than those of the non-CTO group. In addition, the CTO group had greater overall fibrous volume, dense calcified volume, and necrotic core volume in volumetric analysis performed over the whole lesion length, but the lesion length adjusted plaque composition showed no significant difference between the two groups. These findings suggest that plaque characteristics of the CTO lesion were similar to those of non-CTO lesion and that the difference of absolute plaque volume, especially in terms of fibrous volume, dense calcified volume, and necrotic core volume, was due to the difference in large plaque volume caused by the longer lesion length in CTO lesion.",

A compartive study of the lesion characteristics in patients with ACS and SA found that the necrotic core volume of ACS was significantly greater than those of SA. 10) Therefore, these investigators hypothesized that the lesion of ACS had more vulnerable plaque composition compared with those of SA. Another study on the pathologic findings of CTO lesions reported that long duration-CTO lesions were characterized by severe negative remodeling, moderate calcification (16.8%), and low composition of necrotic core area (7.8%). 14) Our study revealed that the necrotic core volume of the CTO lesion (19.8%) was similar (p=0.166) to those of non-CTO lesion (17.5%) in lesion length adjusted volumetric analysis. This finding suggests that the CTO lesion is not more vulnerable than non-CTO lesion. This result is in keeping with previous studies that have found a small necrotic core volume in the CTO lesion. A prior study that investigated the correlation between histology and angiographic findings of CTO lesions suggested that the plaque of CTO lesions evolved from a cholesterol laden plaque to fibrocalcific plaque as a result of an aging process. Formation rates of neovascular channels in intimal plaques derived from the tunica adventitia increase with age and are also associated with intimal plaque cellular inflammation. 15) These findings may help explain the adverse events of PCI in elderly CTO patients, such as coronary arterial dissection and coronary arterial rupture. However, necrotic core volume in lesion length adjusted volumetric analysis of CTO lesions was not different in those of non-CTO lesions in our study. PCI of CTO may carry a risk of adverse events due to neovascular channels derived from the tunica adventitia, but plaque composition of CTO lesions was not different from those of non-CTO lesion, particularly with respect to necrotic core volume, in our study. Thus, CTO lesions may not be more vulnerable than non-CTO lesions.",

            "text": "To date, there have been few studies comparing in vivo plaque composition of CTO and non-CTO lesions. Our findings are in keeping with a recent study on VH-IVUS findings in CTO lesions and non-occlusive lesions, which revealed that the necrotic core percentage was similar to non-occlusive lesions. 16)17) However, these investigators reported that the dense calcium in CTO lesions was less than that in non-occlusive lesions and, thus, the necrotic core/ dense calcium ratio tended to be greater (although statistically insignificant) in the CTO lesions than in non-occlusive lesions. They also reported that a high necrotic core/dense calcium ratio was associated with plaque instability and that this ratio was also associated with an increased creatinine kinase-MB levels in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome. 18)19) We also evaluated for differences in necrotic core/dense calcium ratio of CTO and non-CTO lesions. However, we did not detect a significant difference in the present study ( Table 2). The previously study included ACS patients in their study population, while our study included only SA patients. In the previous study, they suggested that CTO lesions may be more vulnerable than non-occlusive lesions (although there was no statistical significance), but our study suggests that CTO lesions may not be different from non-CTO lesions in terms of plaque vulnerability. This study has several limitations. Firstly, this study was a singlecenter, retrospective study and included a relatively modest number of patients. CTO lesions have been reported that describe the proximal, middle, or distal end of the lesion segment having unique plaque compositions. 14) However, we had modest number of CTO patients, and we analyzed the entire lesion length but did not analyze the lesion according to the proximal, middle, or distal segment. Alas, this study was done to primarily compare the plaque characteristics between CTO and non-CTO lesions. Secondly, all patients in the CTO group underwent VH-IVUS after ballooning, so there was iatrogenic luminal dilatation in CTO lesions, which may have decreased plaque burden and, consequently, affect the percentage of each component of the plaque. However, this is inevitable while performing VH-IVUS in CTO lesions. Thirdly, VH-IVUS cannot appropriately identify a thrombus. Thrombus is often indicated as \"green\" or \"green-yellow\" by VH-IVUS, which was classified as a fibrous or fibro-fatty plaque. However, our study population consisted of patients with SA, which is typically not associated with the presence of a coronary thrombus. In addition, the study population in this study had all undergone successful PCI, and, thus, a modest selection bias is inevitable. However, all 22 CTO lesions in this study underwent PCI and VH-IVUS examination without any difficulty, so this may add minimal distortion of data. Moreover, the distal vessel of CTO lesions is usually contracted and we did pre-dilate the CTO lesion before IVUS examination with intracoronary nitroglycerin. This iatrogenic channel will contribute a bias to the true, pre-dilated lumen diameter of the CTO lesion. However, this problem was inevitable given what is required to perform VH-IVUS in CTO lesions currently.",
