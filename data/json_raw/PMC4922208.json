Mammography screening has been introduced as a beneficial method for reducing mortality and morbidity of this disease. Objectives: We developed an analytical model to assess the cost effectiveness of an organized mammography screening program in Iran for early detection of the breast cancer. Patients and Methods: This study is an economic evaluation of mammography screening program among Iranian woman aged 40-70 years. A decision tree and Markov model were applied to estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs. Results: The results revealed that the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of mammography screening in Iranian women in the first round was Int. $ 37,350 per QALY gained. The model showed that the ICER in the second and third rounds of screening program were Int. $ 141,641 and Int. $ 389,148 respectively. Conclusions: Study results identified that mammography screening program was cost-effective in 53% of the cases, but incremental cost per QALY in the second and third rounds of screening are much higher than the accepted payment threshold of Iranian health system. Thus, evaluation of other screening strategies would be useful to identify more cost-effective program. Future studies with new national data can improve the accuracy of our finding and provide better information for health policy makers for decision making.",

Based on the report published by the Iranian cancer registry, in 2009, there were a total number of 7,582 women diagnosed with breast cancer and the age standardized incidence rate (ASR) was 28.25 per 100,000 (2). Regardless of the underestimated report, it is estimated that about 10,000 women are annually diagnosed and treated with breast cancer. Iran has a relatively young population causing a lower age distribution of breast cancer compared to its counterparts (3). About 51% of diagnosed breast cancer cases are less than 50 years old (2). According to Harirchi et al. (2011), the frequency of patients diagnosed with the advanced stages of disease was higher in Iran compared to the developed nations (4).",

Early detection of breast cancer through population based screening program may decrease the amount of resources spent on the treatment of patients. Otherwise, it imposes extra burden on the society in terms of resources spent on the screening process consisting initial investments needed for screening and the further operational costs required for clarification of the abnormal cases (1).",

Findings of Barfar and colleagues do not support the implementation of national mammography screening programs in Iranian women aged less than 50 years (7). The question is that whether decreases in the cost of treatment and the rate of mortality and disability would be big enough to compensate for the cost of screening and the operational costs of abnormal findings. In other words, would a prospective population based mammography screening program be a cost effective strategy in order to reduce the burden of breast cancer in Iran.",

It was assumed that almost 80% of the target population (7,300,000 women) would participate in the screening program. According to the experts, abnormal findings would be detected in 60% of at-tendances in which almost 7% (3% -10%) require more assessment (13,14). The probability of using invasive or noninvasive assessments procedures were assumed to be 20% and 80% respectively. Akbari et al. (2012) showed that the sensitivity and specificity of mammography are about 69% and 48% in women less than 50 years old and 82% and 67% in 50 years and above respectively (5). In two screening projects conducted by BCRC, similar finding have been discovered (9, 10). Thus, according to expert opinions, overall sensitivity and specificity of mammography were considered 75% and 55% respectively. Women with positive result were considered as breast cancer patients and entered the Markov model. According to the previous studies conducted in Iran, the breast cancer detection rate was estimated to be 1/1000 in screened women (8)(9)(10)15). The probability of developing breast cancer in the intervals between routine screenings (interval cancers) was assumed 0.0001 (0.000072 -0.00024 (14,15).",

About 10,000 patients with breast cancer are diagnosed annually in this target population. Advanced cancers were frequent in 44% of patients while about 14% of them were in stage I of the disease. Table 2 demonstrates the changes in stage distribution of breast cancer before and after screening. It has been shown that due to screening program the proportion of patients in stage I, increases from 14% to 33% and stage III decreases from 32% to 11%. The effect of screening on the target population was demonstrated by a decision tree model (Figure 1). Considering model assumptions, it was noticed that screening could find 5110 cases more than non-screening strategy. To show the changes of QALY due to screening strategies, Markov model was applied ( Figure 2). Results showed that screening could provide 13.400 QALY more than nonscreening strategy which is 1.34 QALY per each participant. Table 3 demonstrates the mean, minimum, and maximum costs of screening, treatment and diagnostic workups per woman participated in the program. It was estimated that cost of mammography screening and evaluation of the abnormal findings in 7,300,000 recruited women was int. $ 3,186,403,941. It means that the cost of finding each cases due to screening policy would be Int. $ 623.562.",

Results indicate that the cost of mammography screening in Iranian women is Int. $ 37,350 per quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY), with a probability of 53% being cost-effective at a threshold of Int. $ 39.300. ICER varies according to the changes in age groups, interval of screening and basic  In this study, we developed a model for comparing mammography screening versus non screening strategy in 40 -70 year Iranian women.

Results of One-Way Sensitivity Analysis (Tornado Diagram) equipment etc., the triennially interval of screening were adopted. Warner et al. (2011) believe that biennially screening increases the probability of recall rate by 40% and chance of unnecessary biopsy by 3% (6). Similar to Fielder study (30), we considered the variation of interval cancer frequency in a range of 24% to 80% of breast cancer incidence. Variation of interval cancer showed only 13% change of ICER in sensitivity analysis, which is a very low range compared to some parameters like recall rate. So it seems that triennially screening costs and effects are not affected very much by interval cancer rates. Comparing these estimations in annually and biannually screening may lead to more accurate conclusion, which can be studied in the future.",

Implementing mammography screening for breast cancer in young population has been criticized by some stud-ies. Salzmann and colleagues (1997) showed that ICER of screening mammography in 40 to 49 year old women is almost five times more than that of the older (32). Screening mammography for women in their 40s can be effective, but its benefit is tiny and expensive (33). In Iran, nearly 12% of women are in 40 -49 age group, and about 16% are 50 years and more. It stresses the need for precise economic evaluation to establish screening program in this young population.",
