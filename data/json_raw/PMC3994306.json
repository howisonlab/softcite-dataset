Three endothelial dysfunction models were established in male W istar rats after exposure to homocysteine (Hcy), high fat diet (HFD) and Hcy+HFD. The results showed that there was endothelial dysfunction in all three models with varying degrees. However, the expression of NEI network was totally different. Interestingly, treatment with simvastatin was able to improve vascular endothelial function and restored the imbalance of the NEI network, observed in the Hcy+HFD group. The results indicated that NEI network may have a strong association with endothelial function, and this relationship can be used to distinguish different risk factors and evaluate drug effects.",

Endothelial dysfunction of either the coronary-, the peripheral-or the cerebral vasculature is a predictor of vascular events and appears to be a marker of atherosclerotic risk. As the largest endocrine organ of the body, the endodermis can receive signals of neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines [2], and can this way be controlled by the NEI network. This fact suggested that NEI network may be a potentially ideal index for the evaluation of endothelial dysfunction.",

Previous literatures have demonstrated that exposure to homocysteine (Hcy) and high fat diet (HFD) can lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction, but the main differences between Hcy and HFD is still unclear. In this study, we compared two models of exposure to Hcy and HFD respectively, with the combined model of Hcy+HFD on vascular endothelial function. The results showed that the vascular endothelial function was affected in all three model groups, in which the No level was significantly decreased and the vWF and sICAM-1 levels were significantly increased. However, there were still some differences among the model groups. For example, the ET level was not obviously changed in the HFD group, and endothelial function was impacted most seriously in the Hcy+HFD group. In addition, endothelial function of the rats in the Hcy+HFD+ Sim group showed a recovery tendency because the levels of ET, vWF and sICAM-1 were significantly lower and NO was significantly higher than in the Hcy+HFD group.",

Increasing evidence has shown that the NEI network plays a pivotal role in regulating homeostasis and optimizing health and makes great contributions to various complex diseases [16]. In this study, we also observed the changes of the NEI network in the three models. The results suggested that Hcy mainly affected the balance of neurotransmitters, HPTA and SAM, while HFD mainly influenced the HPAA, HPTA and RAAS. The combination of Hcy and HFD impacted almost the whole NEI network and showed synergetic damaging effects. It is worth mentioning that, simvastatin reversed the imbalance of the NEI network disturbed by the Hcy+HFD, especially visible at the levels of DA, CRH, CORT, T4, PRA, ALD, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, suggesting that the regulatory role of simvastatin on endothelial function may be associated with the NEI network.",

However, the potential biomarkers found by metabonomics may be surrogates of the metabolic process rather than direct reporters of disease target. Conversely, NEI network has tight connection with disease state, and the discriminating indices captured in the PCA loading plots may lead to therapeutic targets. For example, in this study, we found the levels of T4 in the three model groups were significantly lower than the control group, and these changes can be reserved by simvastatin. This result suggested that T4 may be the key index for vascular endothelial dysfunction. Clinical studies have shown that there is an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and coronary artery disease, and that after treatment with L-thyroxine the endothelial function in the subclinical hypothyroidism patients was improved [19,24]. This fact supported the idea that T4 plays a key role in endothelial function.",
