Material/Methods: Seventy-two New Zealand white rabbits weighing 1.8~2.0kg were used to build a critical-sized cranial defect model and were randomly divided into 3 groups. X-ray, HE staining, general and histological observation, and immunohistochemistry were used to describe the changes caused by normal saline, icariin, and ACGF. Results: Cranial defects were covered with newly formed bone tissue at the 12 th week in icariin and ACGF groups, with red color, hard surface, and no obvious boundary. Densities were the same in 2 groups at 4 timepoints. HE staining showed defects filled with a large amount of fibrous connective tissue, thick collagen fibers, and abundant osteoclasts. No new bone matrix appeared in any of the 3 groups. Trabecular area, trabeculae width, and osteoblast number in 2 groups were more than that of the control group, and osteoclast number was lower. However, osteoclast number among the 3 groups at the 12 th week had no significant difference, which was the same with 4 indicators between the icariin and ACGF groups. From the 4 th to 12 th week, regenerated cartilage was formed and showed positive reaction with BMP-2 and TGFb1 from primary bone, which also was demonstrated by granulation tissue and uniform dyeing. Conclusions: ACGF and icariin both can increase new bone quantity and improve bone quality, which can also promote healing. The effects and mechanisms of icariin and ACGF on the expression of gene are not exactly the same.",

Bone healing is an extremely complex process of biological repair, and has been a major problem in clinical practice. How to promote the healing of bone defect is a current focus of medical research. Scholars in China and other countries have done many experiments and widely discussed the bone healing mechanism with the help of histology, histochemistry, histology, ultrastructure, and biomechanics [2].",

            "text": "Chinese herbal medicine has a history of 7000 years in China. Icariin (C 33 H 40 O 15 , molecular weight 676.67), is an active component of Epimedium, and was reported to have physiological activities such as improving cardiovascular and cerebral vessels, enhancing the sexual glands and the immune system, delaying aging, resisting tumors and viruses, inhibiting osteoclast formation, and promoting osteoblast growth [3][4][5][6]. The mechanism of promoting bone repair and regeneration by icariin is well understood. Autologous concentrated growth factor (ACGF), a new type of biological material, was first proposed by Sacco [7]. ACGF contains transfer growth factor b (TGF-b), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [8,9]. Recent studies have shown that ACGF has the ability to promote new bone formation and implant bone bonding, and shortens the time required for this process [10]. In a certain sense, ACGF can enhance the repair and regeneration of bone defects.",

            "text": "Epimedium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae and is a typical representative of Chinese herbal medicines (Yang) used to repair strengthen bone. Icariin, as the active component of Epimedium, was reported to have many physiological activities, which not only stimulate new bone formation and increase bone mass, but also promotes bone marrow stromal stem cell differentiation to osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclast differentiation [15][16][17]. In addition, except for promoting the expression of TGF-b in rat osteoblasts, icariin also can inhibit the expression of IL-6 and TNF-a, which can inhibit bone resorption and promote bone formation [18]. Thus, icariin has been widely used and is a highly developed method to repair bone defects.  At present, there are 2 kinds of plasma extract in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery: platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) [19,20]. ACGF is isolated from venous blood, just like PRF. However, ACGF is completely without additives such as calcium chloride and bovine thrombin, and is safer than PRF in the control of infection. Studies had confirmed that ACGF can speed the reconstruction of new bone and does not cause viral infections [7]. Due to its fibrous framework composed of various high-concentration growth factors and fibrous protein, ACGF is successfully used as a healing biological material. TGF-b can promote mitotic division of osteogenic precursor cells and fibroblast cells [21]. PDGF can increase OBN, stimulate mitotic division of bone marrow stromal stem cells, and promote capillary regeneration [22]. IGF is involved in the development and differentiation of bone, skin, and nerves, and also has the function of promoting mitosis [23]. VEGF can promote differentiation of osteoblasts, fracture healing, formation of new blood vessels, and enhances permeability [24]. In addition, the polymerization of fibrinogen molecules can capture fiber protein blocks to form a 3-dimensional polymer grid structure, which is thin, soft, osmotic, and rich in elastin. In bone repair and regeneration, fibrin coagulation plays an important role in mechanical support.",

TGF-b is a secreted protein that controls proliferation, cellular differentiation, and other functions in most cells and is widespread in animal bone tissue and platelets [26]. Because of its extensive biological activity and variety of regulatory function, TGF-b can promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, inhibit the activity of osteoclasts, and promote fiber cells to secrete fiber mucin and collagen, which has an important regulatory role in bone cell growth, immunity, and differentiation. TGF-b is an important biological transmitter in injury. TGF-b1 is an important subtype of TGF-b, which can induce the differentiation of primary mesenchymal stem cells into cartilage tissue, and promote the proliferation and maturation of cartilage cells during the process of embryonic cartilage formation [27]. BMP is a multifunctional growth factor in the TGF-b family; it is a highly conserved and functional protein with structure similar to that of other members of the family [28]. Because it can induce bone and cartilage formation in vivo, BMP is called \"osteogenin\" or \"bone morphogenetic protein\". BMP-2 is the most widely studied BMP and is the most active in inducing osteogenesis. BMP-2 was widely found to be highly expressed in cartilage cells, osteoblasts, and their precursor cells [28].",
