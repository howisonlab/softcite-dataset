We estimate different probit models on two panel datasets covering a three-year period before the reform (1987-1989) and a three-year period afterwards (1994-1996). Contrary to a priori expectations, our findings indicate that during transition young children were much less of a deterrent to the employment probability of their mother than they were before transition."

A priori expectations, based on a few indisputable phenomena -the nearly universal female labour market participation in the pre-transition period, the rapid deterioration of child-care facilities during transition, and the increasing discrimination in the labour market against women who could become mothers -suggest that being a mother in transition Poland entailed greater difficulties in combining paid work and family responsibilities than before. However, we will show that employment was more responsive to motherhood before than during transition. In our analysis we will investigate some explanations for this puzzling result and we will discuss the results in the final part of the article."

Fong and Lokshin (2000) examined how women's labour force activity depends on household child-care choices in Romania. They showed that after transition women's labour market activity was strongly affected by the presence of children and was highly responsive to the cost of child care. Saget (1999) estimated a model of labour supply decisions of married women in Hungary to measure the impact of the number and age of children on women's labour supply (in addition to a host of women's characteristics, such as individual wages and a household's non-labour income). Using post-transition data, she found that the presence of young children decreased the probability of a woman participating in the labour market, while the presence of teenagers had the opposite effect.",

In their study of participation behaviour of East German women after German unification, Bonin and Euwals (2002) examined precisely this issue. They wondered how the high unemployment rate and the change in public policies that followed transition impacted the high female labour market participation of the pre-transition period, and whether East German women will eventually adapt their behaviour to West German patterns, characterized by a much lower female employment rate. They found that labour force participation was negatively affected by the number of pre-school children, and that this negative effect increased over time after the unification. However, they do not use data from the period before the unification to estimate how different women's labour market behaviour was before 1990.",

We will argue, based on our results, that in the pre-transition period characterized by virtually no constraints to join the labour market (no unemployment, availability of child-care facilities), preferences -including cultural attitudes and social expectations about the role of mothers in a traditional society such as Poland -played a fundamental role in shaping mothers' employment patterns. On the other hand, during transition, the need for a second earner in the household, the great uncertainty in the labour market, and (for highly educated women) the new opportunities offered by a rapidly developing private sector were powerful reasons for mothers to be in employment, and be able to overcome the increasing difficulties represented by the deterioration of child-care facilities.",

In a patriarchal society such as Poland, women were expected to fulfil the role of main child-care providers. At the same time, women were also expected to work in remunerative employment, both for wages needed to support their family, and because women's labour was essential to the production system in a period of rapid industrialization (Nowakowska and Sw\u00eadrowska, 2000). As Leven (2008) very effectively pointed out, gender equality was ideologically consistent with a socialist state and womenfriendly policies were mandated by a government that lacked popular support. Employed women were concentrated in low skilled and low paid occupations, despite being disproportionally highly educated. 2 Because supply of part-time jobs 2 It should be noted, however, that the pre-transition Poland had one of the lowest female activity rates of all Central and Eastern European countries. Around 1989, about 68 percent of women in 15 -54 years of age were participating in the labour force -a much lower percentage than, for example, in Czechoslovakia, the Baltic States, Belarus, Moldova, Russia, or Ukraine, all with more than 80 percent of female labour market participation. Still, women's activity rates were substantially higher in Poland than in most Western countries. More specifically, all women in the labour force were employed (unemployment being nonexistent in socialist countries) and almost all employed women were working full-time, given the negligible size of part-time employment (UNICEF, 1999).",

            "text": "During transition, activity rates dropped considerably, for both women and men. Polish women experienced a dramatic drop in employment -about 900,000 jobs were lost by women from 1989 to 1995. Unemployment, non-existent in the communist period, was 13 percent in 1997 for women of all ages, and 10 percent for men (UNICEF, 1999). Transition hit women in particular, not just because women were more likely to lose their job and less likely to find one -thus becoming the majority of the long-term unemployed -but also because they were systematically discriminated against in the labour market (especially in the nascent private one). 3 While published statistics and empirical studies on Polish transition extensively document the changes in the social and economic position of women in general following the 1990 events, data on changes in the labour market participation of mothers are hard to find. Some evidence exists on two adverse phenomena for mothers' position in the labour market in transition Poland -the rapid increase in women's discrimination in the private labour market and the substantial decrease in public child care provision. Despite the fact that the cost of maternity leave was still fully covered by the social insurance system, employers in post-1990 Poland were reluctant to hire women who could become pregnant -either to avoid the hassle of finding a temporary replacement or due to the assumption that, once back to work after the childbearing period, mothers would become unenthusiastic workers with outdated skills (Lohmann and Seibert, 2003;World Bank, 2004). According to some studies, increasing discrimination in the private sector meant that women with children were disproportionately more likely to be out of work. A UNICEF study based on the Polish Labour Force Survey finds that 'Poland marriage status -a reliable proxy for the presence of children -was not a factor for unemployed men in finding work, but was a serious handicap for unemployed women' (UNICEF, 1999, p. 29). However, it should be noted that, according to the same study, the presence of children did not increase the chances of employed women losing jobs with respect to men, indicating that many women needed and were actually able to combine paid work and family commitments.",

            "text": "As far as the decrease in public child-care provision is concerned, it is undeniable that child-care services were severely cut during transition (especially in kindergartens), and their fees increased considerably. Nowakowska and Sw\u00eadrowska (2000) estimate that at the end of the 1990s the typical kindergarten fee could account for 30-45 percent of an average salary of a woman with a university diploma. Some authors have stressed that, during transition, increasing costs of child care and demand-side factors were actually more important than the closure of child-care centres in explaining the decrease in enrolment rates. For example, Meurs and Giddings (2004) show that in the case of Bulgaria the drop in fertility rates, as well as the increase in unemployment rates and decrease in real wages -which accounted for a substantial decrease in disposable income and thus in the ability to pay for increasingly expensive child care -were the main drivers behind the decrease in enrolment rates. In Poland, some of the decrease in availability of state-subsidized child care can be explained by a drop in fertility, however the decreased supply of kindergartens and nurseries outweighed the drop in demand -the majority of kindergartens were full or above their capacity during transition (Lohmann and Seibert, 2003), although large geographical variations existed. In any case, it is unquestionable that the cost of raising a child increased substantially, as did the conflict between women's family duties and professional careers (Lohmann and Seibert, 2003). 4 The lack of adequate and affordable child-care services together with labour market discrimination could have 'encouraged' women to drop out of the labour force to raise children. On the other hand, women's dependency on their spouses' and other family members' income as well as their increased inability to return to paid work after long spells out of the labour force 5 were powerful reasons for mothers with a job to stay employed, even at the cost of exceptional efforts to juggle work and family responsibilities. 6 Which of the above contrasting forces prevailed in shaping employment opportunities for mothers during transition is an open question. In addition, it is unclear whether having children affected women's participation in the labour market more during transition than in the pre-transition period. We will explore these issues in the current analysis. 4 It should be stressed that, while child-care provision suffered substantial cuts during transition, the duration of maternity leave and the amount of maternity benefits were maintained at the pre-transition levels. Mothers were paid a basic maternity benefit corresponding to 100 percent wage replacement for 16, 18, or 26 weeks after delivery (of the first child, any subsequent children, or in case of multiple births, respectively) and, if employed, were entitled to unpaid parental leave until the third birthday of the child, while retaining the right to their previous job (Golinowska et al. , 2003). Until 1996, the last year of our sample data, these provisions remained unchanged, and are therefore not responsible for changes in women's labour supply which we may observe between the two periods. Overall, means-tested and insurance-based family benefits characterized Poland as one of the least generous countries in the pre-transition Central and Eastern Europe (Fodor et al. , 2002). 5 In 1997, the female unemployment rate was 13 percent, and almost half of unemployed women (43 percent) were long-term unemployed (out of work for longer than one year) (UNICEF, 1999). 6  Rostgaard (2004) comments that the high cost of child care and the policy of means-tested cash benefits '. . . runs the risk of encouraging low-income women to withdraw from the labour market to care for their children at home, while high-income women are likely to combine work and caring responsibilities because they can better afford costly day care' (p. 34). However -referring to evidence provided by Kurzynowski - Golinowska et al. (2003) claim that '. . . In the late 1990s, women with low-paid but permanent jobs tended to take parental leave and claim parental allowance over four times less frequently than at the time the benefit was introduced' (p. 26).",

Although the individuals observed are not the same in the pre-and post-transition period, we can still exploit all the advantages of using panel data to estimate a model of mothers' employment and compare the results in the two periods. The main advantages of using the Polish datasets through PACO are the consistency of variable definition over time (the original variables have been standardized and codified according to standardized international classifications), and (potentially) the comparability of the results with other countries included in the database (Hungary, among transitional economies, and some West-European economies like Germany and the UK). Moreover, in the case of Poland, PACO includes two panels, one covering the pre-reform period and the other covering the transition period -overall a relatively long time span that allows for comparisons before and after the reform.",

It should be stressed that the first period panel made available through PACO also includes 1990, but we chose to drop this last wave given that reforms in Poland were adopted starting from the 1 January 1990 (Poland is probably the best-known application of the 'shock therapy' among the newly emerging economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union). We chose 16-44 years as the relevant age interval to account for the existence of a non-zero percentage of very young mothers (lower bound); the upper threshold of 44 is typically chosen as the oldest fertile age in studies on fertility behaviour. 10 Figure 1 shows a very interesting and unexpected pattern. For women aged 16-44 years the employment rate dropped very little, on average from 69 percent in the first period to 67 percent in the second period. However, the employment rate of mothers varied substantially depending on the age of the youngest child; moreover, the patterns were quite different in the two periods. Before the transition, only 41 percent of women with a child aged 0-2 years were employed, compared with 68 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 3-5 years, and 79 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 6-11 years. 11 During transition, the employment rate of mothers also increased with the age of the youngest child, but the differences were much less pronounced. Thus, a higher percentage of mothers of a child aged 0-2 years were employed than before the transition -50 vs. 41 percent. However, only 59 percent of mothers of a youngest child aged 3-5 years and 71 percent of mother of a youngest child aged 6-11 years were employed during transition (while the corresponding pre-transition figures were 68 and 79 percent).",

Children aged 3-5 years were much more likely to be in kindergarten before than during transition, and even before transition much more likely to be in child care than children aged 0 -2 years old. The largest difference in the employment rate before and during transition existed for the group of women without dependent children, 87 vs. 73 percent. However, the surprising finding is the comparatively large percentage of mothers of children aged 0-2 years old who were employed during transition -larger than in the first period. These patterns suggest that there were substantial differences in the probability of women to be employed between the two periods that were unrelated to motherhood (as illustrated by the differences in employment rates for women without dependent children between the 1987-1989 and the 1994-1996 periods).",

            "text": "The stylized facts presented in Figure 1 also suggest that the presence and the age of children was a crucial element in explaining women's employment before transition rather than during transition. That is, during transition the female employment rate was much less responsive to the age of the youngest child than it was before transition. This is in contrast with the general notion of universal female labour market participation before transition (which, in the case of Poland, was less than universal) and the foreseeable negative impact on mothers' employment during transition due to the deterioration of child-care facilities, as well as the increased discrimination in the private labour market. Figure 1 shows the employment rates of women by age of the youngest child but does not take into account the total fertility and the changes in fertility patterns between the two periods. It can be argued that fertility is endogenous to labour supply -in fact, fertility rates dropped during transition and postponement of marriage and childbearing became one of the strategies to decrease the conflict between family commitments and paid work (UNICEF, 1999;Lohmann and\u00a9 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Siebert, 2003). Therefore, the large differences in employment rates of mothers with children of different ages observed before the transition could have been driven by a total higher fertility. This is to say that the age of the youngest child heavily influenced the employment rate of the mother due to the presence of more siblings in the first period than in the second period. Table 1 shows that, if there is some validity in this explanation, it is very limited.",

Second, the transition does not seem to have affected the employment rate of mothers as much as it affected the employment rate of non-mothers. While women with non-dependent or no children had substantially lower employment rates in the period 1994 -1996 than they had in the period 1987 -1989 at almost all educational qualifications, the employment rate of mothers was lower in the post-transition period but not by the same large amounts and in the case of mothers of children aged 0-2 years it actually increased during transition.

Women with lower educational qualifications (mothers and non-mothers), by contrast, generally experienced large drops in employment rates, the exception being the mothers of children aged 2 years and younger.

            "text": "Finally, Table 3 shows the employment rates of married women depending on the participation in employment of their partner. Before transition -when the employment rate of men and women was very high -having a partner out of employment was associated with a very high employment participation of the wife, while women with a working partner were less likely to work. This could be due to a genuine effect of the husband's employment status on his wife's employment status (compatible with the added worker effect, as well as with the effect produced by an increase in the household non-earned income on the woman's labour supply). Interestingly, after transition, the difference in the employment rates of the two groups of women is reversed, and having a partner out of employment is associated with a lower probability that the wife is employed. During this period, the employment rate of men also dropped; therefore it is much more common to observe couples where both partners do not work. These patterns suggest that the higher-than-expected participation in employment of mothers (especially of young children) in transition Poland is probably not driven by the spouse being unemployed or inactive. At the same time, the differences between the two periods in the employment behaviour of the two partners suggest that it is important to control for the spouse's characteristics in the multivariate analysis, to account for a certain degree of heterogeneity among women (women whose partner is in employment are likely to be different from women whose partner is out of work). 13 In the multivariate analysis we will explore more rigorously the candidate explanations put forward in the descriptive analysis presented in this section. In particular, we will account for the possibility that fertility and participation in employment are simultaneously determined. Moreover, we will control for the partner's characteristics, in particular his employment status and level of earnings. Finally, we will control for a host of personal and household characteristics of the woman, in particular to address the possibility of correlation between level of education and presence and age of children. It should be noted that the model we estimated and present in the next section is a reduced form, which does not allow disentangling supply-and demand-side effects. Despite this limitation, it can give a good indication of whether any of the explanations put forward thus far is a plausible one.",

Two exhaustive surveys are given by Browning (1992) and Nakamura and Nakamura (1992). These articles review the main issues concerning the estimation of the effects of the presence of children on women's labour supply and examine some select studies on this topic. The vast majority of the empirical studies find a negative correlation between fertility and women's labour supply. However, the interpretation of this result must consider a number of issues. The existence of heterogeneity among women, differing in their fixed unobserved preferences for work and children, introduces selection effects that can bias 'genuine' effects. For example, it could be that women with a higher 'taste' for children are those with lower unobservable abilities and skills in the labour market. In that case, it would be this selection effect to drive the observed association between a higher number of children and lower labour market participation, rather than a 'true' causal effect due to discrimination",

Availability of panel data in the more recent empirical investigations of female labour supply allows for a proper consideration of unobserved heterogeneity. However, when this womanspecific time invariant component is correlated with the desired number of children, a problem of endogeneity of the fertility variables arises. A possible approach to this problem is to follow Chamberlain (1984) and parametrically specify the individual unobserved heterogeneity allowing for correlation with the observed fertility variables. We follow this suggestion in our empirical analysis, given the major problems characterizing alternative solutions, like the Instrumental Variable (IV) estimation. 14 Such an approach allows for simultaneous correlation between fertility and labour supply behaviour, but still rests on the strict exogeneity assumption, ruling out any correlation pattern between fertility and past and future working status, and thus a possible feedback from past employment on future fertility. Given the difficulties arising from relaxing the strict exogeneity assumption, we will follow Wooldridge (2002) and run a test to get some evidence on its plausibility in our specific application.",

There is evidence of a high degree of serial persistence in individual participation decisions, possibly due to state dependence (with current participation depending on past participation) and persistent heterogeneity (when the unobserved individual component determines current participation irrespective of past participation). As a consequence, econometric models of female labour supply should explicitly include dynamic factors. Recent studies by Hyslop (1999) and Troske and Voicu (2004) adopt a dynamic framework to evaluate the interaction between fertility and labour supply decisions.

This indicates that the specified correlation between the fertility variables and the individual unobserved heterogeneity is able to capture at least part of the mechanism generating a feedback effect from past participation to future fertility behaviour, although we cannot claim that the validity of our estimation results is free from any threat due to endogeneity of the fertility variable. In particular, in case of (neglected) feedback from past employment to current fertility, the coefficients of the fertility variable are likely to suffer from an attenuation bias, as it is reasonable to argue that past participation is positively related to both current fertility and participation. With this caveat in mind, we can nevertheless look at the general pattern displayed by the estimated coefficients of the fertility variables -the key variables of interest in our analysis -and observe that they are negative in both the pre-reform and transition period (that is, having children negatively impacts the probability of working, as expected). Not surprisingly, the size of this effect decreases as the age of the child increases, indicating that a lower amount of mother's time is needed for child-care of older children. 19 The most striking pattern emerging from our results is the decrease in the absolute value of the coefficients of the fertility variables moving from the first to the second period, for all three models. Within the CRE model, while in the first period all the fertility variables have significant coefficients, during the transition period the only significant effect is associated with the presence of very young children (aged 0-2 years). The pattern presented in Figure 1 and discussed in the descriptive analysis is therefore confirmed, even after controlling for the potential endogeneity of fertility, and all the relevant personal and household characteristics of the woman, including the characteristics of her partner.",

Similarly, during the transition period, the biggest effects -in absolute terms -were estimated for women with low or professional education, while the likelihood of employment of women with high educational qualifications was less affected by the presence of a young child. These results confirm that the educational level was a key dimension affecting employment after transition, eventually more important than family circumstances. There is abundant evidence that during transition the increase in unemployment hit the lowest educated people in particular, 20 while the demand for employees with high level of human capital increased steadily. 21 On the other hand, the demand for employees with primary or incomplete primary education, and for graduates from postsecondary schools declined significantly (Kwiatkowski, Socha and Sztanderska, 2001).",

None of the variables included in the model (women's age and education, partner's employment status, earnings of the partner, area characteristics) can reverse the finding of a smaller (in absolute value) effect of children in the second than in the first period, nor can the fact of having allowed for endogenous fertility using the CRE model.

For example, an increase in part-time employment in the transition period could explain why mothers were more likely to be employed -availability of part-time employment usually mitigates the negative effect of children on women's labour supply. Unfortunately we do not have information of whether employment was part-time or full-time, so we cannot control for this variable. However, there is evidence of no increase in part-time job opportunities in the second period; data provided by enterprises indicate instead that a slight drop in the share of part-time employment occurred, from about 10 percent before transition to 8.8 percent in 1998 (Kwiatkowski, Socha and Sztanderska, 2001). Also, we do not have information on women's earnings and other nonearned income. It is possible that during transition mothers were pressured to stay in employment (if they had a job) or to take up employment because of the powerful, negative income effect produced by the drop in real wages (theirs and their husband's).",

We can think of reasons why mothers in the transition period may have had an incentive to remain in the labour market. The change in the general economic environment represented by the transition to a market economy was characterized by tremendous adjustments and restructuring, high layoff rates and low re-employment rates. The resulting uncertainty in the labour market could have represented a powerful incentive for women to work despite the presence of young children. Moreover, in the first period, despite labour market constraints (including no unemployment) being much lower and women's labour market participation rate being higher, the traditional role of caregiver assigned to women represented a powerful disincentive for mothers of young children to join the labour market."

            "text": "Finally, the two phenomena that lead us to expect a stronger disadvantage for mothers in the second period -increasing labour market discrimination and substantial cuts in child-care facilities -may have been overemphasized as far as their effects on the labour market participation of mothers of young children are concerned. Lohmann and Seibert (2003) report that, during transition, employers preferred women aged 25 -35 years over older women. The reasons for this preference probably being that younger women are better educated, better able to adapt to a free market economy, more likely to master ICTs and foreign languages, and also more physically attractive. That is, as much as employers may have disliked the possibility that these women could become mothers, there were plenty of advantages in hiring younger rather than older women that compensated for the risk of the employee becoming pregnant. On the other hand, younger women, many of them highly educated, were eager to stay in employment even after the birth of a child to make the most of career opportunities that were much more exciting than in the pre-transition period. As for child-care provision, while it dramatically decreased during the 1990s and its cost soared, this was much less the case for nurseries, which were very few even before transition. In general, child care was not adequate before transition and was less widespread than in other countries of the former Socialist Block, especially in rural areas. As a matter of fact, only 4 percent of children below 3 years were enrolled in day nurseries in the 1980s. 22 Interestingly, a demographic study on the propensity of becoming a mother before 1989 reaches conclusions that are coherent with our findings. In comparing first-birth intensity in Hungary and Poland during state socialism, Ol\u00e1h and Fratczak (2004) find that in Poland, where the family policies were less generous than in Hungary, the propensity to become a mother was reduced for employed women. Although they investigate fertility choices (rather than labour supply behaviour), one of their main findings is that the combination of full-time employment \u00a9 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and family responsibilities was more difficult in pre-transition Poland than in Hungary. 23",

Before transition, despite the very high female participation in employment, Polish mothers -especially mothers of young children -were substantially less likely to work than childless women. During transition, to our surprise, the negative effect of motherhood was substantially lower than in the pre-transition period. In the multivariate analysis, a significant coefficient was estimated only for mothers of children aged 0-2 years old and even in this case the average population effect turned out to be much smaller than in the pre-transition period. This result goes in the opposite direction to what one would have expected, based on the common notions of very high female labour market participation in the communist Poland, sustained by the existence of family-friendly policies and a publicly-funded affordable network of child-care facilities, which were dismantled during transition, making women's participation in employment theoretically more difficult.",

The most plausible interpretation is that, before transition, in absence of constraints in accessing the labour market, women could realize their preferences for lower employment in coincidence of motherhood or were 'forced' out of work by the expectations of a traditional society that required mothers (especially of very young children) to be the primary caretakers of their children. At the same time, although child-care services were much more affordable before than during transition, in the pre-1989 Poland availability of child care was already a problem, especially for very young children and in the rural areas of the country. On the other hand, during transition, the uncertainty in the labour market, the process of restructuring, the necessity of relying on two earners in the household, the need (and desire) of not being cut out of new job opportunities in the growing private sector, and the gloomy perspective of long-term unemployment after a prolonged period out of the labour market could have represented more powerful 'pushing' factors for women to work than the disincentive produced by the deterioration of child-care facilities. This is not to say that women were not experiencing growing difficulties in combining paid work and family responsibilities, \u00a9 2009 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2009 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development nor that this conflict was without potentially negative consequences for women's employment.
