            "text": "I collect data on how subjects acquire information about risky choices in both real and hypothetical settings using process-tracing software called Mouselab. On average, there are no significant differences across settings in the amount of time subjects take to make a choice or the completeness of the information they acquire. Subjects also acquire information in sequences consistent with an integration model of decision-making, such as expected utility theory or prospect theory. I do not find significant differences in risk preferences across settings, on average, but I do find that subjects' risk preferences are related to the completeness of the information that they acquire and where they start their information acquisition. (JEL C91,D80,D83) Estimating individual risk preferences using \"real-world\" decisions with economically significant consequences is often impractical. Studies that do use real-world choices must generally proceed without observing the probabilities used in the decision-making process or contend with other confounding factors. The obstacles associated with using real-world data have encouraged the use of laboratory experiments to explore many questions related to risk preferences because experiments provide increased control. But the choices used in laboratory experiments typically involve real stakes of less than 100 dollars (usually much less), so laboratory experiments that use real payoffs are often criticized for studying decisions with economically insignificant stakes (Levitt and List 2007). Moreover, laboratory experiments are normally prohibited from exploring how individuals behave when faced with the prospect of losing their own money.",

            "text": "Given the challenges to using real-world choices and the doubts about the generalizability of results from laboratory experiments that use real, but economically insignificant stakes, Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 265) concluded, \"By default, the method of hypothetical choices emerges as the simplest procedure by which a large number of theoretical questions can be investigated.\" Economists, however, have been extremely reluctant to use hypothetical choices to explore risk preferences, even though the evidence on whether individuals treat hypothetical risky choices differently than real risky choices is inconclusive. 1 Several studies find that individuals faced with hypothetical choices indicate that they are less risk averse than they actually are (Battalio, Kagel, and Jiranyakul 1990;Harrison 2006;Holt andLaury 2002, 2005), but other studies do not find evidence of such \"hypothetical bias\" (Beattie and Loomes 1997;K\u00fchberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Perner 2002;Wiseman and Levin 1996). Taylor (2013) finds that only individuals with higher cognitive ability tend to make choices exhibiting hypothetical bias. 2 These contradictory results have yet to be explained. Camerer and Hogarth (1999) illustrate that real incentives are likely to alter behavior when the task involved depends on the subject's effort level. But the choices that are typically used to measure risk aversion are designed to measure preferences, not effort. Moreover, while it is clear how economic incentives can cause individuals to misrepresent their willingness to pay for clean air in a survey that could influence environmental policy, there is not an obvious economic motivation for why individuals would systematically misrepresent their risk preferences so that they appear more risk tolerant when they make choices with hypothetical consequences. 3 This study uses a method of process tracing to explore whether individuals acquire information about the risky choices in the commonly used Holt and Laury multiple-price list (HL MPL) differently when the choices have hypothetical monetary consequences rather than real monetary consequences (Holt and Laury 2002). It is possible that individuals may attend to the information in hypothetical choices differently than real choices, and several studies have demonstrated that how individuals acquire information can be related to their decision-making. For instance, Costa- Gomes and Crawford (2006) show that simplified searches are correlated with deviations from equilibrium in a two-person guessing game, and Caplin, Dean, and Martin (2011) find that search patterns can affect subjects' decisions conditional on choice complexity.",

Murphy and Stevens (2004) discuss the lack of theoretical reasoning for hypothetical bias with respect to willingness-to-pay elicitation and their case is actually more applicable to risk preference elicitation. Carson and Groves (2007) consider the incentive properties of \"inconsequential\" survey questions in the context of valuation studies, but their conclusion that \"economic theory makes no predictions\" about respondent behaviour is equally relevant here. acquisition behavior is significantly different for hypothetical and real risky choices. Wilcox (1993) is the only other study that explores a similar question. In particular, it tests whether subjects spend different amounts of time on decisions when there is variability in the fraction of subjects who will be paid. This mechanism, known as the random lottery mechanism (RLM), adds additional uncertainty to an experiment from the perspective of the subject because only a portion of subjects will be paid based on their decisions. Wilcox finds that subjects spend more time on higher-yielding decisions, where \"higher-yielding\" implies a greater probability that the subject will be selected to have at least one of her choices have real consequences. Like Wilcox (1993), I also observe the amount of time subjects spend on each choice, but I also observe what types of information subjects acquire, how much information they collect before making a decision, and the sequences in which they collect that information.",

Mouselab is a method of processtracing used by psychologists for nearly three decades, and economists more recently, because it is lower-cost alternative to eye-tracking and provides analogous measures (Costa-Gomes and Crawford 2006;Costa-Gomes, Crawford, and Broseta 2001;Gabaix et al. 2006;Johnson et al. 2002;Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1988;Reutskaja et al. 2011). The software enables the researcher to \"mask\" selected information so that a subject must move the computer pointer over the attribute to reveal it. In this experiment, the probabilities and payoffs (the attributes) of each gamble were masked and the individual was required to \"unmask\" the attributes by scrolling over the cell to view it. Once the mouse pointer leaves the cell, the attribute is hidden again. By requiring a subject to unmask the gambles' attributes and allowing them to view only one piece of information at a time, individuals' strategies for acquiring information about risky choices is observable in this stylized context. 6 An example of how each pair of gambles was presented to subjects in the experiment is shown in Figure 1. 7",

Finally, to address concerns about possible left-to-right and top-to-bottom bias in subjects' attention to different areas in a choice display (Reutskaja et al. 2011), the presentation of the gambles was randomized along three different dimensions: (1) whether the probabilities or the payoffs were presented in the top row, (2) whether the safe gamble or the risky gamble was on the left, and (3) whether the high payoff or low payoff was on the left within each gamble. This randomization was by subject, and not across choice scenarios for any one subject.

This measure acknowledges that some subjects may recognize the complementary nature of the probabilities and the fact that they can compute expected value without opening both probabilities in each gamble. This measure is called 1(EV-Sufficient), and it takes a value of zero or one for each choice depending on whether the subject viewed sufficient information to compute expected value. A second measure of information breadth is how many unique attributes a subject opened for a given choice, Unique Attributes. Since each choice has eight pieces of information, this measure ranges from zero to eight for each choice. 10 Given that the results are not substantively different for the two measures, I present the results for 1(EV-Sufficient) below."

Interdimensional transitions are transitions among the dimensions of a particular option, each option has four dimensions in this experiment, and they are consistent with an individual integrating the components of an option into a single value, like expected value. Intradimensional transitions are transitions across options to the same dimension. These types of transitions are consistent with an individual using a heuristic. For instance, someone may always choose the option with the highest potential payoff. The search metric (SM Index) introduced by B\u00f6ckenholt and Hynan (1994) is one index that indicates whether information acquisition is dominated by interdimensional transitions or intradimensional transitions, and it takes the following form:",

Although the panel structure of the data allows fixedeffects models to be estimated, the experimental design imposes a constraint on fixed-effects models that prevent us from using them to appropriately address the primary question of this study. A more detailed explanation is provided in Appendix S1. Fortunately, a fixed-effects model is not necessary. Table A1 in Appendix S1 shows results from fixedeffects specifications that are consistent with the main results discussed below, and Table A2 in Appendix S1 shows that coefficient estimates and standard errors generated from ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects, and random-effects models for Decision Duration are nearly identical. spent less time on each choice, approximately 5% less, and made fewer acquisitions, as they progressed through the first task in the real setting. This is congruent with the expectation that individuals will spend more time on the choices they see earlier and will decrease the amount of time on each choice as they become more familiar with the format. Somewhat counterintuitively, however, the coefficient estimates on the interaction of Position Number and treatment imply that subjects who faced hypothetical choices in both tasks and real choices in the second task reduced time spent on choices at a slower rate than subjects who faced real choices in the first task. Figure 2 reveals the reasons for this result. First, subjects who faced real choices in the first task spent significantly more time on the first choice. These subjects spent more than 22 seconds on their first choice, on average, while subjects who faced hypothetical choices in the first task spent approximately 16.4 seconds on their first choice (p = .025, adjusted for withinsubject correlation). After the first choice in the first task the amount of time subjects spent on each choice is comparable across settings-the two lines for the first task overlap and they do not significantly diverge in the second task. If the first choice that subjects completed is excluded and an identical model is estimated there is no difference between the slopes. 15 Second, subjects spent significantly less time on the first choice in the second task because they were repeating the same task, regardless of the setting.",

In other words, subjects are less responsive to changes in the difficulty of the choices when the choices are hypothetical than when they are real, but only in the second task. Figure 3 shows this pattern visually. For each treatment, Decision Duration is fit with a quadratic with respect to the HL Decision Number. The two thin lines plot the real and hypothetical settings in the first task, and both follow very similar paths. The thick-dashed line plotting Decision Duration for the hypothetical choices in the second task, however, diverges dramatically from the thick-solid line plotting the time spent on each decision in the real choices, and this explains the difference in unconditional means shown in Table 3.

The complementary nature of the probabilities allows a subject to infer the difficulty of the choice by opening any of the probability cells, and, in fact, there was a slight tendency for subjects to begin their searches in a probability cell-more than 53% of searches started in a probability cell-but the percentage is not significantly different from 50% (p=.135). 16 Location.

In this case, it does not appear that this difference in duration in the second task affected choices, but it should be considered when designing an experiment that asks subjects to repeat a task in both real and hypothetical settings."

            "text": "Hypothetical scenarios in surveys and experiments are valuable because they allow economists to explore questions that would be extremely costly or impractical with real consequences. In some cases, the only way to proceed with research is to use hypothetical choice scenarios. This study finds that some measures of information acquisition are related to risk aversion, but on the whole individuals do not acquire information about hypothetical choices in a significantly different way than they do about real choices, and that risk preferences are not significantly different across settings in this context. Considered in conjunction with several prior studies that do not find differences in risk preferences across settings (Beattie and Loomes 1997;K\u00fchberger, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, and Perner 2002;Wiseman and Levin 1996), there is evidence to suggest risk preferences obtained via hypothetical choices are not necessarily biased and that economists should not reflexively dismiss them.",
