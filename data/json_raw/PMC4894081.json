            "text": "Background: Hospitalized premature babies often undergo various painful procedures. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) and swaddling are two pain reduction methods. Objectives: This study was undertaken to compare the effects of swaddling and KMC on pain during venous sampling in premature neonates. Patients and Methods: This study was performed as a randomized clinical trial on 90 premature neonates. The neonates were divided into three groups using a random allocation block. The three groups were group A (swaddling), group B (KMC), and group C (control). In all three groups, the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were measured and recorded in time intervals of 30 seconds before, during, and 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds after blood sampling. The neonate's face was video recorded and assessed using the premature infant pain profile (PIPP) at time intervals of 30 seconds. The data was analyzed using the t-test, chi-square test, Repeated Measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis, Post-hoc, and Bonferroni test. Results: The findings revealed that pain was reduced to a great extent in the swaddling and KMC methods compared to the control group. However, there was no significant difference between KMC and swaddling (P \u2265 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that there is no meaningful difference between swaddling and KMC on physiological indexes and pain in neonates. Therefore, the swaddling method may be a good substitute for KMC.",

            "text": "According to the international association of pain study, pain is an unpleasant feeling and an emotional experience following actual or potential tissue damage (1), which is created by a harmful stimulus, and its goal is essentially to defend and protect (2). Presently, it is accepted that neurons are formed during the embryonic period and anatomically and functionally have the necessary efficiency to conduct painful stimuli (3). Premature neonates are able to identify and react automatically to pain as early as 20 weeks of age (4). In addition, premature neonates are less able to reduce or inhibit painful stimuli because of descent neuron lines, which make them more sensitive to pain (3,5). According to the world health organization (WHO), 15 million premature neonates are born globally each year, which is more than 0.1 of total neonate births (6). Premature neonates undergo many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which is reported to be more than 10 to 16 interventions per day (7)(8)(9). Unfortunately, 40 to 90 percent of neonates do not receive any preventative or therapeutic actions to reduce the pain of these painful interventions (7,8,10). The most common intervention is blood sampling, or heel stick, to prepare laboratory samples (11). Continuous pain impulses by afferent nerves to specific areas of the brain cause atrophy of that part of the brain. The repeated pain of procedures leads to ventricular bleeding in premature neonates, increases in brain plasticity of neonates, and reduction of subcortical white and gray matter, with subsequent increases in fluctuations inside the skull (12). Therefore, controlling the pain of harmful procedures, such as blood sampling, is of great importance, especially in premature babies, as it is proposed that the neonatal pain threshold is 30 to 50 percent less than in adults (3,5). Moreover, uncontrolled pain can increase the risk of infection, the hospitalization period, and the death rate of neonates (13). Pain relief, which is among nursing interventions, can be done with or without medicine (14). Although the use of powerful medications for neonatal surgeries is an accepted practice, using such medications in painful interventions such as blood sampling is not appropriate (15). Fortunately, it has been proven that nonmedical interventions have greater impact on reducing pain caused by procedure (14). Swaddling and Kangaroo mother care (KMC) are two of the non-medical methods. KMC was innovated in 1979 in Colombia (16) and its pain controlling function can be justified with the neuromatrix theory of pain (17). The effect of KMC on neonate pain was first examined in 2000 with term neonates (18), then in 2003, in preterm neonates (19), and after that, by many researchers, with its effectiveness being established. Another pain controlling method for neonates is swaddling, which has advantages including improving sleep (20) improving neuromuscular growth, reducing pain and crying (21), and reducing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (21, 22).",

After a dressing was placed on the blood sampling site, the neonate's hand was placed back in the swaddle and the condition was kept for 2 minutes after blood sampling. Before blood sampling each neonate, the initial part of the tool was completed by the researcher, and this part included demographic and physiological information of the neonate (heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation). Physiologic information was obtained with a Saadat co. Arya brand monitoring machine that was calibrated by the medical equipment engineer in the hospital. In addition, the neonate's face was video recorded with a Canon camera for 2 minutes following the moment of blood sampling. In KMC, the neonate had only a clean diaper and socks and was placed in direct skin contact with the mother's chest, with the head at a 60 degree angle. In order to avoid lowering the neonate's body temperature, the neonate's back was covered with a thin blanket and the mother was asked to wrap her hands around the neonate's back, limit the neonate's movement, and avoid any additional actions, such as talking, caressing, moving, and feeding the neonate. After 10 minutes (18) of KMC, blood sampling was done on the neonate's hand and KMC was maintained for a further 2 minutes. The neonate's face was video recorded from the time of blood sampling until 2 minutes after. The videos were then coded and a single observer (an experienced research assistant that was unaware of the type of intervention) was asked to complete the premature infant pain profile (PIPP) tool for each video. In order to measure physiological parameters, a pulse oximeter attached to the neonate's hand was used to measure the heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. These parameters were measured and recorded before, during, and after blood sampling.",

            "text": "According to the findings of this study, the swaddling method reduces the pain of arterial blood sampling in neonates to a similar extent as the KMC method. The physiological index differences in both groups of swaddling and KMC were more stable and less than the differences in the control group. The average pain comparison score in neonates with swaddling was less than in the control group. It is possible to justify the reduction of pain in swaddling using the Gate control theory of pain. According to this theory, stimulation of larger sensory fibers from touch receptors in areas of pain, or further ones, leads to pain signals weakening, therefore, it can be suggested that swaddling reduces pain by stimulating touch. One of the other effects of swaddling is warming the neonate. Heat    increases blood flow and may reduce pain through excretion of metabolic materials which cause pain. Another way to reduce pain is muscle relaxation, which means muscle slackness, and reduction of respiratory and heart rates.   Swaddling may reduce pain by reducing the respiratory and heart rates. In a study by Huang, it was found that the pain score in the swaddling group was lower than in the containment group (28). Also, in a review study by Meek in England, swaddling was identified as one of the effective nursing actions in reducing premature neonate pain (29). The findings of these two studies are consistent with the findings of the current research. In a review article in 2011 in Canada by Pilla Riddell et al. (30), it was suggested that swaddling can inhibit pain but may not be as effective as KMC, which is not consistent with the findings of this clinical trial. It is possible that this contrast is because of the guesses based on results of two studies, one by Johnston et al. (31) and another by Huang et al. (28), as no clinical study was done to compare these two methods. According to results of the current study, swaddling as a multi-dimensional intervention can reduce a neonate's pain to a considerable degree. This study found that physiological changes were less in the swaddling and KMC methods, and it was more stable compared to the control group. As was mentioned earlier, perhaps swaddling limits the neonate's movements and prohibits muscle stretch, causing muscle relaxation, and therefore improving respiration, increasing oxygen saturation, and decreasing heart rate. A study by Ho and Ho not only showed that the average pain from blood sampling in swaddling had a significant reduction compared to the control group (P = 0.001), but it also showed that heart rate and oxygen saturation indexes reached the baseline in 2 minutes, whereas in the control group, 6 to 8 minutes were needed for the indexes to return to baseline (32). The findings of this study are in line with the present study. However, a study by Khoddam et al. concluded that neonate and mother skin contact during intramuscular injection do not decrease physiological indexes of pain and only cause less neonate crying (16), which is in contrast with the findings of the current research. This contrast may be because the insufficiency of the sample in Khoddam's study, which was only 15 in the intervention group and 15 in the control group. It may be further explained by the short period of hugging time, as in Khoddam's study the neonate was hugged just at the moment of blood sampling, whereas in this study the neonate was hugged for 10 minutes before blood sampling. Considering the results of the current study, swaddling, like KMC, is an effective way to stabilize the physiological indexes of the neonate.",

A systematic review which was done in 2007 on swaddling behavior stated that swaddling organizes the nervous behavior of the neonate well (21), which is in line with the findings of this study. Multiple studies refer to the effect of swaddling on neonate's sleep (33). It is possible that the improvement of neonate's sleep by swaddling is a reason which reduces the facial changes in response to pain. In the present research, it may be proposed that the neonates became sleepy when swaddled, and this reduced the changes in their face during the painful intervention. Fernandes stated that the appearance reaction can be a more practical observation than body movements and crying, and also can be more specific than physiological changes which are the total response to stressful stimuli (1). Assuming that this is true, nurses can understand the neonate's pain experience without using any specific tool and only by observing the neonate's face.",

This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.020). The Bonferroni test revealed that there was no significant difference between the swaddling and KMC groups (P = 0.407) and also between the swaddling and control groups (P = 0.498), but there was a significant difference between the KMC group and control group (P = 0.016). It was observed that the blood sampling time was less in the KMC group than the other two groups. A possible explanation may be the vertical position and gravity, which improves blood flow and therefore allows sampling to be done faster. This issue has been mentioned in Johnston's study as well (31). Considering these findings, sampling can be done in a shorter period of time in the KMC method.",

Considering the limitation of sample volume, some differences are seen in the basic value of some demographic factors, such as birth weight, which is possibly the cause of random error.",
