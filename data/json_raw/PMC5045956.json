However, as getting older, patients with thalassemia experience different complications which impair their quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a nurse-implemented orientation program on quality of life in patients with thalassemia. Methods: A convenience sample of 55 patients with thalassemia were recruited in this quasi-experimental study. Patients were randomly allocated to control or experimental groups. A demographic questionnaire, Thalassemia quality of life questionnaire, and 36-item short form health survey were used for data collection before and one month after the intervention. In the intervention group, 1.5-month orientation program including of the three steps of inauguration, implementation, and closure was implemented, while the control group received routine care. The Chi-square, independent t-test and paired-samples t-test were used for data analysis by using SPSS ver.13 software. Results: The intervention and control group did not differ significantly from each other regarding demographic characteristics. Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the quality of life scores after the implementation of orientation program. Conclusion: Implementing a short-term orientation program was not effective in enhancing the quality of life in patients with thalassemia; hence, developing long-term multimodal strategies may result in better improvement.",

            "text": "Thalassemia is the most common hereditary hemoglobinopathy worldwide. 1 It is more common in the Mediterranean, north African, as well as east and west Asian countries such as Greece, Italy, Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. 2 It is also common in our country, Iran; however, the prevalence of the disease differs in different areas of Iran. Akhavan-Niaki et al., reported that the prevalence of thalassemia in the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf areas of Iran is more than 10% of population while it ranges from 4% to 8% in other areas of the country. 3 Thalassemia is treated mainly by blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy. 4 Currently, great advances have been made on the strategies for managing thalassemia and prolonging survival among afflicted patients. 5 Nonetheless, the signs, symptoms, and complications of thalassemia still negatively affect patients and their families' physical and mental health, 6 quality of life (QOL), and their functioning. 7 Previous studies have shown that patients with thalassemia have significantly poorer QOL compared with healthy people. [8][9][10][11][12] Given the better life expectancy of patients with thalassemia due to the aforementioned advances, the challenging issues of managing long-term complications of the disease and improving afflicted patients' QOL have been raised. 13 Str\u00f6mberg argued that patients with thalassemia need to learn self-care skills for improving their own QOL. 14 Moreover, studies have shown that patients with thalassemia are eager to receive self-care information and educations.",

However, for having sound statistical analyses and considering the attrition rate, we recruited 30 patients for each group. The study sample was drawn by using the convenience sampling method. Patients were included if they were desired for participation in the study, had an age of sixteen years or older, had no healthcare professional among their family members, were able to read and write Persian, and had no severe hearing or visual problems affecting their orientation to place, time, and person. The exclusion criteria were developing infectious diseases or severe physical complications. Patients were randomly allocated to either the intervention or the control groups by using a table of random numbers.

The demographic questionnaire consisted of patients' personal characteristics and clinical data. The TQOLQ was developed by Allahyari et al., based on the Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Quality of Life Questionnaire. It contains eight items for investigating QOL among patients with thalassemia and had 0-6 Likert-type responses for scoring each items of the TQOLQ. Lower scores reflect higher QOL. The validity of the TQOLQ has been confirmed by assessing its content validity; Cronbach's alpha of the questionnaire was 0.84 based on a previous study. 18 We also used the SF-36 for evaluating patients' general QOL. This questionnaire is used for assessing health-related QOL and it consists of 36 items in eight domains of physical functioning, social role functioning, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health perceptions. These 36 items are scored on 0-100 scale-the higher the score, the better the QOL. 19 Previous studies have reported that the Persian SF-36 is a reliable instrument for assessing QOL. Montazeri et al., translated the SF-36 into Persian and reported Cronbach's alpha values of 0.65-0.90 for it. 20 Primarily, we invited the study samples to complete the demographic questionnaire, the TQOLQ, and the SF-36. Patients in the intervention group attended an orientation program which included the three steps of inauguration, implementation, and closure. In order to enhance the effectiveness of the orientation program, we divided patients in the intervention group into three sub-groups and oriented each group independently.",

Gollo et al., also reported a score of 86.1 for the physical functioning domain which was higher than the scores of other domains of SF-36. 10 On the other hand, the lowest score was related to the emotional role functioning domain. Hadi et al., also reported that among the domains of the SF-36, thalassemia patients' emotional role functioning score (67.86) was the lowest one. 11 These findings can be attributed to the fact that thalassemia care in Iran mainly focuses on managing patients' physical problems rather than other aspects such as psychological problems. Consequently, patients usually feel higher QOL in the physical functioning domain. However, despite considerable negative effects of thalassemia on patients and their families' emotional and psychological health, they are usually neither assessed nor cared for their emotional or psychological problems. These findings highlighted the necessity for providing consultation and psychological care services to these patients.",

Most of the complications of thalassemia start to develop at the earlier ages of life, as early as the age of six months; hence, at older ages, patients with thalassemia are usually suffering from severe effects of both thalassemia and its associated complications. This could be the reason behind the ineffectiveness of our short-term intervention in improving patients' QOL.",

Patients with thalassemia need different types of physical and particularly psychological and emotional care. Given the chronic nature of the disease and the severity of associated complications, a short-term orientation program, like our intervention, would be insufficient for improving patients' QOL. Accordingly, thalassemia care services should be provided over a long period of time for achieving significant outcomes. It seems that the results of this research will help to engage patients in the care and treatment effectiveness.",
