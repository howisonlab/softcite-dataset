            "text": "Epithelia transport solutes and water between body compartments and external surfaces, using both transcellular and paracellular routes. Paracellular ion transport is believed to occur through pores in the tight junction (for review see Reuss, 2001). These pores are now known to be formed by four-transmembrane domain proteins known as claudins (Tsukita and Furuse, 2000 ; Van Itallie and Anderson, 2006). In channels that mediate transcellular transport, ions move perpendicular to the plane of the cell membrane, traversing the low-dielectric environment at the interior of the lipid bilayer, with stabilization and selectivity conferred by the transmembrane domains of the pore protein. Paracellular ion permeation through claudins is likely to be quite different because ions move parallel to and extracellular to the plane of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 1). This pathway is potentially highly hydrated and lined predominantly by the extracellular domains of claudins. The permeability properties of the native paracellular pathway have been carefully characterized in leaky epithelia, such as rabbit gallbladder (Barry et al., 1971 ; Wright et al., 1971) and cultured kidney tubule cell lines (Cereijido et al., 1978). However, the degree to which claudin-based pores exhibit ion selectivity and the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Attempts to measure claudin permeability quantitatively in an overexpression system have been hampered Correspondence to Alan S.L. Yu: a l a n y u @ u s c. e d u Abbreviations used in this paper: DMC, dynamic Monte Carlo; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; TM, triple mutant; WT, wild-type. by the fact that many claudins behave predominantly as barriers rather than pores. Those that do increase permeability mostly increase it modestly above background, and such results are confounded by the contribution of background permeability due to endogenous claudins that are present in all epithelial cells ("

This is a widely used technique ( Van Itallie et al., 2001 ;Yu et al., 2003 ;Hou et al., 2008 ). However, we now realize that this is inaccurate because there is also a liquid junction potential across the fi lter itself when it is blank, but not when cells are cultured on it. Therefore, to deduce the pipette potentials, we had to correct for this blank fi lter junction potential. Fig. 2 A shows the Ussing chamber setup with a blank fi lter.

            "text": "In our Brownian dynamics simulations, claudin-2 was modeled as a cylindrical pore with a diameter of 6.5 \u00c5 , based on our experimental estimates ( Fig. 7 B ). The pore was assumed to have a length of 10 \u00c5 , connected to two cone-like vestibules on either side, which represent the entrances to the pore and are in contact with the extracellular solution ( Fig. 11 A ) (see Online Supplemental Material II for details of our simulations, including the channel geometry; Fig. S4; both are available at http://www.jgp .org/cgi/content/full/jgp.200810154/DC1). The widest part of these vestibules was assumed to be 7.6 \u00c5 in radius, and the entire length of the paracellular pore was assumed to be 32 \u00c5 . For simplicity, the dielectric constant inside the aqueous pore was assumed to be the same as that in the bulk solution ( Graf et al., 2000( Graf et al., , 2004, with w = 80, and the cell/claudin-2 was characterized by a uniform effective dielectric constant, p = 20, which falls within the range of previously adopted protein dielectric constant ( Smith et al., 1993 ;Simonson and Brooks, 1996 ;Pitera et al., 2001 ). For transmembrane ion channels ( Corry et al., 2001 ;, a comparatively smaller p (i.e., p = 2 -5) is usually used to account for the low dielectric constant in the interior of lipids (i.e., = 2) ( Pethig, 1979 ). For a paracellular pore, we anticipate a larger effective dielectric constant should be used for p because the pore is formed by the extracellular protein (i.e., p = 10 -40) and the dipole layer ( Andersen and Fuchs, 1975 ) formed by the lipid head groups may contribute to an increase in the effective dielectric constant for the cell. D65 was treated explicitly as a negatively charged spherical particle to mimic the carboxylate moiety of this residue, which is characterized by its size R D , charge q D , and the distance between the channel centerline and the sphere center R C , and located in the middle of the pore. The particle description of D65 allowed us to preserve some molecular-level properties of the D65 residue. All other charged residues (E53, D76, R30, and K48) in the fi rst extracellular domain were treated as point charges, and the calculation of electrostatic potential due to these charges was performed by solving Poisson ' s equation. Claudins are multimeric and have been proposed to form hexamers ( Mitic et al., 2003 ); therefore, residue point charges and D65 particles were inserted six times, 60 \u00b0 apart. The effective charges were assumed to be 0.2 e and \u03ea 0.2 e for positive and negative point charges, respectively. For simplicity, the positive charges were assumed to face away from the channel and be separated from their neighboring negative charges by 2.5 \u00c5 in the radial direction (perpendicular to the channel axis; compare Fig. 11 A ).",

To investigate the interaction between permeating cations and the claudin-2 pore, we determined the permeability of claudin-2 to other alkali metal cations using biionic potentials ( Fig. 7 A and  Table I ). The permeability sequence was found to be: K + > Rb + > Na + > Li + > > Cs + . This sequence is quite different from the sequence of their free-solution mobilities and resembles Eisenman selectivity sequence V -VIII. This suggests that permeating cations have to dehydrate to enter the claudin-2 pore, and that there must be a moderately high fi eld strength, negatively charged interaction site within the pore that stabilizes the dehydrated cation ( Diamond and Wright, 1969 ;Eisenman and Horn, 1983 ). This would also explain the high selectivity for cations over anions. However, the ratio between the permeabilities of the most permeable cation (K + ) and the least permeable (Cs + ) was 1.6, which is quite narrow and suggests that the interaction site is partially hydrated.

Dilution potentials determined at different apical/basolateral NaCl activity ratios fi t well to a Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation ( Fig. 4 C ). We therefore used 150 mM NaCl/75 mM NaCl dilution potentials and the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation to derive relative permeabilities for Na + and Cl \u03ea . Table I lists the raw data, which is summarized in Fig. 4 D . Induction of claudin-2 increased P Na by \u202b\u0641\u202c 10-fold compared with control Dox+ cells; P Cl was increased approximately fourfold. By subtracting the conductance and permeability in Dox+ cells from that in Dox \u03ea cells, we derived the increase in transepithelial conductance and permeability attributable to the introduction of claudin-2 -based paracellular pores ( Fig. 4 E ). We therefore have a quantitative measure of the macroscopic conductance and permeability of a claudin-based pore. By this method, the permeability of claudin-2 to Na + was determined to be 7.5 \u00b1 0.9 times its permeability to Cl \u03ea . Thus, claudin-2 forms cation-selective pores. Furthermore, these pores appear to be nonrectifying and exhibit a fairly linear relationship between conductance and Na + concentrations The transepithelial diffusion potential, V TE , was determined at different NaCl activity ratios (apical activity/ basolateral activity) and plotted on a log-linear scale.

When the pH of the extracellular fl uid was lowered, claudin-2 conductance fell promptly, at a rate (time constant 8.2 \u00b1 0.02 s) similar to that of solution mixing in our Ussing chambers, suggesting a diffusion-limited process ( Fig. 7 C ). Moreover, pore, its permeability to three organic cations, methylamine, ethylamine, and tetramethylammonium, was determined and fi t to a Renkin equation ( Fig. 7 B and Table II ). The pore diameter estimated by nonlinear regression was 6.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 . This is smaller than the diameter of a hydrated Na + ion, 7.2 \u00c5 ( Nightingale, 1959 ), so that Na + would likely have to shed at least part of its hydration shell to permeate through the claudin-2  tivity to show convincingly that the fi rst extracellular domain of claudins lines the paracellular pore ( Colegio et al., 2002( Colegio et al., , 2003Van Itallie et al., 2003 ). However, it is unclear whether these mutants also inform on the location of the ion selectivity fi lter or merely refl ect artificially created electrostatic fi elds within the pore that affect ion permeation. Indeed, the fact that mutations of most charged residues in the fi rst extracellular domain have a similar effect would suggest the latter. There are three acidic residues in the fi rst extracellular loop of claudin-2: E53, D65, and D76. To test the hypothesis that one or more of these might be responsible for the negatively charged cation-interaction site in the claudin-2 pore, we mutated each of these to its neutral, polar counterpart (E53Q, D65N, and D76N), generated a triple mutant (TM) bearing all three mutations, and generated stable, inducible MDCK I TetOff cell lines expressing each mutant. By neutralizing instead of reversing the normal charge at each site, we expect to pinpoint only those residues that are part of the normal selectivity mechanism. Clones were selected that expressed similar levels of claudin-2 protein to WT and showed good induction and suppression. Mutant cell lines exhibited similar levels of expression and subcellular localization of claudin-2 protein to the WT claudin-2 clone, and similarly had little effect on expression of endogenous claudins ( Fig. 8 ).",

However, D65N exhibited threefold lower conductance and Na + permeability, with no change in Cl \u03ea permeability, and the TM was indistinguishable from D65N ( Fig. 9, A and B ). Thus, D65 is required for maximum cation permeability of claudin-2. The temperature dependence of conductance and Na + permeability was measured and fi t to the Arrhenius equation to determine the activation energy of permeation (E a ). Mutation of D65 to N increased the activation energy for conductance (41.8 \u00b1 4.3 kJ/mol vs. 39.7 \u00b1 1.9 kJ/mol for WT) and P Na (42.7 \u00b1 2.0 kJ/mol vs. 39.0 \u00b1 1.4 kJ/mol for WT) ( Fig. 9, C and D ). The observed changes of 2 -4 kJ/mol are the right order of magnitude to account for the permeability changes (an e -fold reduction in P Na would be expected with an increase in the height of the energy barrier of 1 RT = 2.6 kJ/mol) and suggest that D65N in some way impedes the kinetics of Na + permeation, rather than reducing the number of available pores. Furthermore, the permeability pattern of organic cations and estimated pore diameter (5.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u00c5 ) of D65N was not signifi cantly different from that of WT claudin-2 ( Fig. 7 B ), excluding steric hindrance as the explanation.

Li + is the smallest and hence most strongly hydrated alkali metal. In order for Li + to permeate a narrow pore such as claudin-2, the huge energy cost of dehydration must be offset by an energetically favorable interaction with a site within the pore. Inspection of Eisenman ' s sequences shows that as the fi eld strength of an electrostatic interaction site decreases, the fi rst consequence is that the relative position of Li + is progressively demoted. Thus, the relative permeability of Li + is a highly sensitive marker of the fi eld strength of an intrapore electrostatic interaction site, and its reduction in D65N and TM strongly supports the notion that the side chain of D65 is part of such a site.",

Assuming the same ion diffusivity profi les for all cations (compare Table S6, model 4), the relative permeability ratio among different cations is Li > Na > K > Rb > Cs. Our results show that relatively small differences in cation radius can result in detectable differences in selectivity when the geometric features of the channel, dielectric and diffusion constants for the ions, etc., are chosen appropriately. It should be noted, however, that our simple model is unsuccessful in one respect: when the negative charge on the D65 residue is abolished, the relative permeability plot remains qualitatively similar to that shown in Fig. 11 D for the anionic D65 case. That is, the relative permeability of Li + does not decrease in the Brownian dynamics simulations as it does experimentally (compare Fig. 10 D ). This failure may be due to the highly simplifi ed rendering of the D65 residue adopted here, as noted in Discussion below. our experiments ( Fig. 11 C ). The model also allows us to estimate the conductance of a single claudin-2 pore over a range of Na + concentrations. At a concentration of 150 mM Na + , the conductance was \u202b\u0641\u202c 70 pS, and at saturation it was 450 pS. Fig. 11 D shows the sequence of cation selectivity predicted by the Brownian dynamics model developed herein, which bears a respectable similarity to the corresponding experimental curve shown in Fig. 7 A . It is not obvious a priori that such a model can distinguish between cations of the same valence, and indeed previous discussions have expressed pessimism concerning the fl exibility of Brownian dynamics simulations in this regard ( Corry et al., 2005 ). The primary differences between, say, an Na + ion and a Cs + ion in this type of simulation are the radius of the bare ion and its bulk diffusivity.

We chose to use cations as size probes because we wished to know the effective size of the pore for cation permeation. However, there are only a few small nitrogenous organic cations. Moreover, the chemical characteristics, and particularly the availability of groups for hydrogen bonding, of different nitrogenous cations are quite different. To the extent that this may affect interactions with the pore wall, their permeability is not a pure function of size. Thus, it is reassuring to fi nd that our estimate is not dissimilar from that of Van Itallie et al.

We suggest that this yields a quantitative measure of the macroscopic conductance and cation permeability of claudin-2 -based pores. Our reasoning is supported by three observations. First, claudin-2 induction does not alter the number of tight junction strands. Thus, claudin-2 pores are presumably inserted into existing strands, and their conductance would be expected to be additive over the background conductance. Second, claudin-2 does not substantially alter the expression of other known endogenous tight junction membrane proteins (claudins 1, 3, 4, and 7, and occludin). Thus, changes in paracellular permeability are probably not confounded by changes in endogenous tight junction proteins, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other as yet unidentifi ed endogenous claudins could be affected. We currently do not have a structural explanation of how \" extra \" claudin molecules can insert into existing strands without displacing endogenous tight junction proteins. Third, the conductance of overexpressed claudin-2 is very high compared with the baseline transepithelial conductance of MDCK I cells, so that the signal to noise ratio is high. site, whereas the other acidic residues in the fi rst extracellular domain, E53 and D76, are not. The role of the fi rst extracellular domain in determining charge selectivity of claudins has already been fi rmly established ( Colegio et al., 2002( Colegio et al., , 2003Van Itallie et al., 2003. However, our fi ndings differ substantially from those of James Anderson ' s group. Van Itallie, Colegio, and colleagues used analysis of the number of charged residues in WT claudins, and the effect of charge-reversing mutations to indicate that charge selectivity depends on the additive effect of all the charged residues in the second half of the fi rst extracellular loop ( Colegio et al., 2002 ;Van Itallie et al., 2003 ). This would suggest a mechanism in which the general electrostatic environment within the pore determines charge selectivity, and not a discrete binding site. However, charge-reversing mutations are potentially misleading because they introduce new charges that did not exist in the native protein and therefore may refl ect artifi cially created electrostatic effects, rather than inform on the location of the normal selectivity fi lter.",

This is based on the fi nding that the permeability of alkali metal cations follows a high-order Eisenman sequence, and that the cation selectivity is abrogated by extracellular acidifi cation. Acidifi cation could of course be acting allosterically at a distant site to alter claudin-2 conformation and hence permeability. However, the fi nding that acidifi cation reduces P Li /P Na and changes the alkali metal selectivity to a lower-order Eisenman sequence strongly suggests that it is titrating the negatively charged binding site. The suggestion that this is an intrapore site and not a surface charge is also supported by the fi nding of a linear conductance -concentration relationship. At low Na + concentrations and hence low ionic strength, screening of any surface charges by the bulk solution is minimized and the local Na + concentration at the pore entrance would be increased ( Green and Andersen, 1991 ). This would be expected to result in anomalously high conductance at low Na + concentrations. Instead, we observe a linear relationship, suggesting that the negatively charged site is within the pore.",

In this model, consistent with experimental suggestion of dehydrated permeating cations, different alkali metal cations are assumed to be fully dehydrated (for simplifi cation) and distinguished by their bare ion sizes and diffusivities. Ions having a smaller radius can approach the charge on D65 more closely, as well as giving it access to a larger accessible volume (entropic effects, i.e., excluded volume effect) in the selectivity fi lter.

For example, while keeping all other parameters the same, a cylindrical channel with a uniform pore size of 3.25 and 32 \u00c5 in length gave a channel conductance almost 1.7 times smaller than the claudin-2 model with conical vestibules (same minimum pore size and channel length, but with a funnel-like channel entrance).

We found that over experimentally reasonable ranges of these parameters, the basic computational conclusions reached for the claudin-2 model pore developed herein did not change.
