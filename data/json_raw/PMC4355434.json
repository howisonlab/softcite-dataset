            "text": "Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) can be a challenging procedure for an inexperienced surgeon. We suggest an easy technique for TURBT, which we have named the \"grasp and bite\" technique. We describe this technique and compare its effectiveness and safety with that of conventional TURBT. Materials and Methods: Monopolar TURBT (24-Fr Karl Storz) was performed in 35 patients who had superficial bladder tumors. After defining the tumor margin, the tumor and surrounding mucosa were grasped by use of a loop electrode and resectoscope sheath. With tight grasping, linear moving resection was performed. The patients' demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were analyzed between the conventional and grasp and bite TURBT groups. Results: Of 35 patients, 16 patients underwent conventional TURBT (group 1), and the other 19 patients underwent grasp and bite TURBT (group 2). Both groups were similar in age, tumor multiplicity, size, anesthesia method, and location. Grasp and bite TURBT could be performed as safely and effectively as conventional TURBT. There were no significant differences in irrigation duration, urethral catheterization, postoperative hemoglobin drop, or length of hospital stay. No significant side effects such as bladder perforation, severe obturator reflex, or persistent bleeding occurred. There were no significant pathological differences between specimens according to the type of resection technique. Conclusions: The grasp and bite TURBT technique was feasible for superficial bladder tumors. It may be a good tool for inexperienced surgeons owing to its convenient and easy manner.",

For the grasp and bite technique, the operator initially defined the tumor morphology and safe margin. In small and f lat lesions, the tumor and surrounding mucosal lesions were positioned between the resection loop and the end portion of the resectoscope sheath. The resectoscope sheath was then moved backward carefully. The tumor could be held tightly with the loop electrode and sheath. We call this the \"grasp\" step ( Fig. 1; Video clip, Supplementary material). Using the grasping technique, the tumor lesions were lifted up. In the \"bite\" step, the surgeon maintained a tight hold and resected the tumor while grasping. A cystoscopic view and schematic illustrations are shown in Fig. 1. For resection during the bite step, the movement of the electrode loop was straight backward in a linear direction. Resection was performed carefully so as not to cause bladder perforation without excessive bladder wall distention. Poorly located tumors were accessed by suprapubic pressure and nearly emptying the bladder. When necessary, cold cup biopsy was done at the tumor base and edges. The resection site was carefully inspected for bleeding and coagulation. In bulky or pedunculated tumors, the protruding mass was resected rapidly with the grasp and bite technique. After removal of the bulging mass, the base lesion and surrounding mucosa were resected carefully by using grasp and bite TURBT as mentioned earlier. Also, the tumor margin could be resected in the same manner repeatedly.",

Achievement of the above purposes is not so easy for an inexperienced surgeon. Also, tumor recurrence after TURBT is relatively high. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the probability of recurrence after 1 year ranges from 15% to 70% [6,7]. Many obstacles can arise during the procedure, such as bladder perforation, bleeding, obturator reflex, and damage to the ureteral orifices. To overcome these difficulties, many surgical techniques and innovative devices have been developed. For example, endoscopic snare resection of a bladder tumor can be used to remove pedunculated tumors [5]. Although the snare method offers the advantage of en block resection, smaller and sessile tumors are not suitable for this technique. New devices such as water jet hydrodissection and the thulium:yttrium aluminium garnet laser may be applicable for en block resection of superf icial tumors [8,9]. However, further studies and development of these techniques are necessary to determine efficacy and oncologic outcomes.",

The sideto-side bidirectional lateral rotating handgrip and loop allows excellent precision and control over the loop under direct vision [4].

The movement of the loop is somewhat fast and deep to avoid charring of the surrounding mucosa and bladder perforation [11]. These are key technique of TURBT, but not so easy to perform. Our technique has the merit of acquiring adequate tissue. Direct pressure to the bladder wall may allow deeper tissue to protrude into the bladder wall and then be easily removed by use of the resectoscope. Instead of the curvilinear movement of the resectoscope end according to the curved bladder surface, the easy linear motion can make a curved resection with grasping. Using our \"grasp and bite\" technique, beginners can easily perform TURBT safely. Often, small and sessile tumors are missed and severely damaged during resection and cauterization. The grasp and bite technique can effectively be applied to small, flat, sessile lesions. For larger tumors, the protruding tumor can be removed f irst by the conventional method, and then the stalk and base lesion can be removed by the grasp and bite technique. Poorly accessible tumors are difficult for complete resection. In theory, the grasp and bite technique could have difficulties in a posterior or posterolateral located tumor because of its moving mechanism. In our series, two posterior and four posterolateral tumors were successfully accessed by use of suprapubic pressure and nearly emptying the bladder. Similar to conventional TURBT, it was also difficult to access posterior tumors with the grasp and bite method.",

General anesthesia was preferred in the conventional and grasp and bite groups (81.3% vs 57.3%, p=0.138). Also, tumor locations did not differ significantly between the two groups (p=0.253). We postulated that the grasping method, which lifts the tissue away from the obturator nerve and tightly holds the grasped tissue, may eventually weaken the reflex. Considering this small population, however, we cannot make conclusions and need to f urther study a larger population.",

Thus, there could have been a selection bias. Also, the study population was small, and thus we were unable to perform statistical analysis of the oncologic outcome as recurrence-free survival. This was a preliminary study to develop a surgical technique performed by an experienced surgeon. Larger prospective studies with a long f ollow-up period will be necessary to show the oncologic advantage of this technique. To determine the feasibility of the technique for inexperienced surgeons, future study will address a teaching protocol comparing the conventional and grasp and bite methods. Owing to the nature of retrospective research, histologic information was not fully acquired.",
