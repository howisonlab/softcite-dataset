OBJECTIVES: To analyze changes in cardiac function, using Doppler echocardiogram, in critical patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation, using two different weaning methods: pressure support ventilation and Ttube; and comparing patient subgroups: success vs. failure in weaning. METHODS: Randomized crossover clinical trial including patients under mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h and considered ready for weaning. Cardiorespiratory variables, oxygenation, electrocardiogram and Doppler echocardiogram findings were analyzed at baseline and after 30 min in pressure support ventilation and T-tube. Pressure support ventilation vs. T-tube and weaning success vs. failure were compared using ANOVA and Student's t-test. The level of significance was p,0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-four adult patients were evaluated. Seven patients failed at the first weaning attempt. No echocardiographic or electrocardiographic differences were observed between pressure support ventilation and Ttube. Weaning failure patients presented increases in left atrium, intraventricular septum thickness, posterior wall thickness and diameter of left ventricle and shorter isovolumetric relaxation time. Successfully weaned patients had higher levels of oxygenation. CONCLUSION: No differences were observed between Doppler echocardiographic variables and electrocardiographic and other cardiorespiratory variables during pressure support ventilation and T-tube. However cardiac structures were smaller, isovolumetric relaxation time was larger, and oxygenation level was greater in successfully weaned patients.",

            "text": "The return of spontaneous breathing can increase myocardial O 2 demand and the product of heart rate 6 arterial blood pressure by as much as 35%, which can lead to myocardial ischemia. However, this increase was not associated with weaning failure. [2][3][4] A study of 15 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who failed during weaning from MV demonstrated that, during the first 10 min of spontaneous breathing, there was an increase in cardiac index (CI), heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP) and arterial blood pressure (BP). 5 An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) from 8 to 25 mmHg was associated with evidence of acute respiratory failure due to increased preload. 5 After 1 week of treatment with diuretics, these patients were weaned successfully. 5 There is evidence that 6-10% of patients exhibit electrocardiographic findings of cardiac ischemia while being weaned, mainly those with coronary artery disease. 5 Echocardiography is being used routinely in some intensive care units (ICUs). It permits direct observation of all cardiac structures and the patient's hemodynamic status, allowing immediate intervention related to volume replacement and the use of inotropic agents. 6,7 In patients on MV, its use can explain some cardiac morphological and functional analyses that may influence weaning from MV, particularly when weaning is difficult or there is refractory hypoxemia that cannot be explained by lung disease alone. 8 Nevertheless, there are few descriptions in the literature of bedside studies of these cardiorespiratory changes during weaning from MV using echocardiography. 9,10 The objective of this study was to analyze changes in cardiac function using Doppler echocardiogram in critical patients in a general ICU during weaning from MV using pressure support ventilation (PSV) and T-tube, and to compare a subgroup of patients: success vs. failure during the weaning trial.",

            "text": "Several research teams have investigated prognostic indices for weaning success, including f/V T ratio [12][13][14] and P 0.1 . 15 The lower the f/V T , the greater the chance of successfully withdrawing MV. 12,14,16 In our study, f/V T was higher and P 0.1 was lower among patients who could not be weaned, although without statistical difference. However, in agreement with the literature, successfully weaned patients showed better oxygenation levels. 15 Physiological changes associated with the transition from MV to spontaneous breathing involve an overload of the cardiorespiratory system: increased venous return (preload), increased LV afterload, increase in O 2 consumption from 15% to 25% and increased secretion of catecholamines.   In patients with preexisting heart disease (coronary artery disease and LV insufficiency), these physiological changes associated with spontaneous breathing can trigger LV failure, which in turn may lead to respiratory failure and unsuccessful weaning. 2,3,17 In our study, there were no differences in cardiorespiratory variables analyzed by echocardiography between the two weaning methods, suggesting equivalency between both methods of weaning in the population studied. Our results are in disagreement with recent data published in the literature. 10,18 Caille et al. 10 analyzed weaning patients and observed that echocardiogram can detect T-tube-induced changes in the central hemodynamic status, helping to identify patients at high risk of cardiac-related weaning failure. Cabello et al., 18 monitoring weaning patients with a Swan-Ganz catheter, also observed differences in cardiovascular responses comparing T-tube with PSV. It is important to consider that, in these studies, there was a large number of patients with cardiac diseases and/or signs of cardiac failure. In our sample, patients were under MV for a long period of time, but there was no evidence of preexisting defined heart disease or LV failure. The baseline LA diameter, intraventricular septum thickness, posterior wall thickness and LV diastolic diameter were significantly larger among patients whose weaning failed. It has been demonstrated that increased LA size could cause an increased filling pressure due to reduced LV compliance or diastolic dysfunction. There is evidence in the literature suggesting that this increase in the size of the LA measured by echocardiography could be predictive of cardiovascular outcomes even in individuals without atrial pathologies or valve disease. 19,20 We also observed in our study that the value of IVRT was significantly lower among failing weaning patients. Also, the pressure gradient represented by the deceleration time, which normally changes in line with IVRT, was lower, although not statistically significant among patients who failed. The deceleration time is characteristically prolonged when relaxation is abnormal and becomes shorter when relaxation is rapid or high ventricular filling pressures occur. 21 The IVRT can be influenced by factors including ischemia, hypoxemia and right ventricle overload (which prolong the time) and blood volume status (indirect variation). Its absolute value is inversely related to PCWP, 22 i.e. the lower the value of IVRT, the higher the PCWP. 23 Our patients did not exhibit hypervolemia, which could have influenced the behavior of echocardiographic measurements. The preload, assessed in terms of the E/E9 ratio measured by tissue Doppler, demonstrated variation within normal limits (below 15), 24 without any significant difference between the two groups of patients.",

In addition, no severe ischemic heart or heart failure patients were included, which may explain the absence of ischemia and cardiac dysfunction during weaning. Another limitation is that, although no patient had clinical signs of cardiac failure, fluid balance or the use of diuretic drugs before the weaning trial were not recorded.  ",
