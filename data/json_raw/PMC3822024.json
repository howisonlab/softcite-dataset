We evaluated maximal sensory block level (MSBL), and other sensory block characteristics after spinal anesthesia in early and late second trimester pregnant women. Methods: Forty-four pregnant women scheduled for cervical cerclage under spinal anesthesia in the early second trimester (Group E) or in the late second trimester (Group L) were enrolled in this study. Spinal anesthesia was performed at the L3/4 and 7 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected into the subarachnoid space. Hemodynamic variables, incidence of nausea/vomiting, ephedrine dose, and sensory block were recorded every 2.5 min during the first 15 min and 20 min after the injection. The MSBL, the time at which MSBL was achieved, and the time to the two-segment regression of the sensory level were also recorded. Results: The maximum number of segments blocked was significantly greater in the Group L than in the Group E. The incidence of nausea/vomiting and hypotension, and dose of administrated ephedrine were significantly higher in the Group L than in the Group E. The mean arterial pressure during the 15 min after subarachnoid injection was significantly lower compared to the baseline value in the Group L. Conclusions: The MSBL of spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7 mg were T9 in the early and T5 in the late second trimester groups. Pregnant women in the late second trimester exhibited increased incidence of hypotension and need for ephedrine than women in the early second trimester.",

In late stage of pregnant women, the volume of the lumbosacral subarachnoid space is reduced due to engorgement of epidural blood vessels resulting from compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus [1,2]. The enhanced spread of spinal anesthesia, comparable in magnitude with that observed in the term group, occurred in the second trimester group [1].",

On arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring devices (Patient monitor M1205A, Philips, USA or Micro O2, Siemens, Germany), including an electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and a noninvasive blood pressure cuff, were applied to the patients. Baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Before spinal anesthesia, all patients intravenously received 8-10 ml/kg of crystalloid solution. Patients were placed on their right side and the puncture site was disinfected. Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the subcutaneous tissue or muscle at the L3/4 interspinous space. A 25-gauge Whitacre spinal needle was inserted using the midline approach. When a free flow of cerebrospinal fluid was confirmed, 7 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine (Marcaine \u24c7 , Astra Zeneca, Sweden) was injected into the subarachnoid space at 0.1 ml/sec. After performing spinal anesthesia, patients were placed in the supine position with a wedge under the right hip for five minutes and then in the lithotomy position for surgery. Since then cervical cerclage was started. In Group L, amniocentesis was performed add to cerclage for decompression of intrauterine pressure. The endpoint of the study was reached when the sensory block was below T10 in the recovery room, and the patients were transported to their room. The spinal anesthesia was performed by a second year resident.",

A mechanical factor that could be one possible explanation is the decreased CSF volume at lumbosacral area caused by the distension of the extradural veins due to obstruction of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus [4,5] and changes in the curvature of the spinal column [6]. Epidural venous distension develops in the first trimester and remains throughout the third trimester [7]. Lee and colleagues [3] investigated the level of sensory block after spinal anesthesia in pregnant women in their second trimester (15.7 weeks mean gestational age). In their study, the maximal block level with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7 mg was T7 in the second trimester and it was greater by three dermatomes than in the nonpregnant group. When considering the mean gestational age, this result was similar to our study in that patients in the early and late second trimester group had maximal sensory block levels of T9 and T5, respectively. Although compression of the vena cava by the enlarged uterus mechanically did not occur in the early second trimester, venous distension secondary to the increased blood volume associated with pregnancy did occur [8]. In our study, fetal weight measured by ultrasonography was 89.0 \u00b1 7.6 vs 616.6 \u00b1 196.0 gm in the Group E and L, respectively. In the late second trimester group (22.5 \u00b1 2.0 weeks mean gestational age), the increased size of the fetus and the enlarged uterus might compress the vena cava similar to the third trimester.",

Hirabayashi et al. [10] measured the progesterone concentration of the CSF in non-pregnant, first, second, third trimester, and term pregnant women. They observed that the progesterone concentration of the CSF in third trimester and term pregnant women was higher than in non-pregnant, first, and second trimester pregnant women. However, the maximal cephalad spread of spinal analgesia was higher in second, third trimester, and term pregnant women. Their study suggests that not only a minimum level of progesterone in the CSF but also a certain period of exposure may be necessary for the enhanced spread of spinal anesthesia. Bader et al. [13] investigated the effect of progesterone on neural blocks although the cellular mechanism of progesterone is unclear, and found that a development period for increased sensitivity of the nerves to local anesthetics was needed. A certain period of exposure to elevated levels of progesterone resulting in increased sensitivity to local anesthetics is thought to be probable explanation for a more enhanced spread of spinal anesthesia in late second trimester pregnancy than in early second trimester pregnancy.",

SBP decreases by 6-8% at the middle stages of pregnancy and HR increases at the second trimesters by 20% [14,15]. In our study, although we could not compare the hemodynamic changes with non-pregnant women, we were able to investigate the cardiovascular response to spinal anesthesia in the early and late second trimester. The incidence of nausea/vomiting and hypotension, and dose of administrated ephedrine were significantly higher in the Group L than in the Group E. Seven out of twenty-two patients in the late second trimester group had hypotension occur after spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 7 mg. Our results possibly suggest that cardiovascular responses to spinal anesthesia are different between early and late second trimester pregnancy. The time at which MSBL was achieved, and the time to the TSR of the sensory level were faster in the Group L, but did not have any statistical difference.",

First, after performing spinal Vol. 65, No. 4, October 2013 Spinal anesthesia in second trimester anesthesia, patients were turned to the supine position for five minutes and then fixed in the lithotomy position during the operation. It is thought that the lithotomy position can limit the cephalad spread of local anesthetics because of the loss of the lumbosacral curvature. However, according to a study by Logan and Drummond [16], limiting hip flexion to 90 o does not alter the level of anesthetic sensory block. Second, our study was not blinded for the patients and observers because the amniocentesis was added to cervical cerclage in Group L for decompression.",
