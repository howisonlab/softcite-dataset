However, few studies on this topic have been conducted in Italy, a country with universal healthcare and one of the most aged populations in the world. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity in a Northern Italian region, to investigate its distribution by age, gender and citizenship and to analyse the correlations of diseases."

            "text": "In the past decades, multimorbidity, that is, the co-occurrence of at least two chronic conditions in one individual, has increasingly become a challenge for healthcare services. 1 Barnett et al 2 estimated that, in Scotland, almost one-fourth of all individuals, and more than half of those with a chronic disorder, have multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is more common among women and older people, 3 and is now considered the most prevalent chronic health condition in the overall population. 4 It has been reported that people with multimorbidity have poorer quality of life and worse outcomes, 5 and are frequent users of healthcare services. 6 In fact, the treatment of multimorbidity results in high healthcare costs and involves multiple professionals. However, although many clinical guidelines are available for the management of specific chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and heart failure, there is a lack of evidence-based integrated treatments for patients with multiple diseases. 7 So, the treatment of multimorbidity would require a holistic approach to cope with patients' complex healthcare needs, 8 9 and continuity of care",

The hospital discharge record (HDR) database, which includes demographic characteristics, admission referral source, admission and discharge dates, main diagnosis, up to five secondary diagnoses, up to six interventions (identified using the ICD-9-CM coding system) and discharge status. HDRs are sent by all public and private hospitals to the Regional Authority and on a regular basis from the Regional Authority to the Ministry of Health after data quality control. Since 1995, the diagnosis-related group system has been systematically used to allocate funds to hospitals and to monitor quality of care and outcomes. 2. The mental health information system. This register was implemented in 2005 for administrative and clinical epidemiological purposes. All adult patients who have at least one contact with the community mental health centres (CMHCs) are recorded in the database, which includes demographic characteristics, the ICD-9-CM diagnosis and information of each type of intervention administered. 3. Residential mental healthcare discharge records, a database active since 2008 that includes mandatory information on patients discharged from non-profit or accredited private facilities, that is, admission and discharge dates, main diagnosis and discharge status. Accredited facilities are private hospitals where fees are reimbursed by the Italian National Health Service if the patient is an official resident in Italy. 4. The outpatient pharmaceutical database, which contains information on patients' gender and age, prescriptions (substance name, ATC System code-V.2013, trade name, date of prescription filling and number of packages) and prescribers. This register includes drugs reimbursed by the healthcare system that are prescribed by the general practitioner or a specialist, or directly delivered by the hospital pharmacies. 5. The regional mortality register database, which contains information on patients' demographic characteristics as well as date, place and cause of death. This database was used to identify patients who alive on the prevalence date. The study population comprised of all adults (aged \u226518 years) who were residing in the region of Emilia-Romagna on 31 December 2012. Emilia-Romagna is a Northern Italian region with \u223c4.4 million inhabitants, of which almost one-fourth are aged \u226565 years and >10% are foreign citizens-one of the highest proportion among all Italian regions."

Under the Italian Constitution and its recent modification (2001), the State has exclusive power to set the 'essential levels of care' for all residents throughout the country, whereas the regions have responsibility for the organisation and administration of publicly financed healthcare. Primary healthcare is provided by general practitioners remunerated on a capitation base/ formula; they are in charge of providing care and assess patients' needs, order diagnostic procedures, prescribe drugs and refer patients to specialists and hospitals. They thus act as 'gatekeepers' for the system and ensure continuity of care to patients with chronic diseases."

Doctors in emergency services are not asked to report migrants who have no residence permit (law 94/2009 'Norms on public security'). In Emilia-Romagna, hospitalisation is lower among immigrants than among Italians, for men and women, when excluding obstetric causes. Even if hospital admissions of immigrants increased from 3.1% of total in 2002 to 7.4% in 2009, the number continues to be lower compared with hospital admissions of residents. However, immigrants tend to have more frequently urgent hospitalisations, probably due to limited knowledge of community health services and general practitioners. 14 ",

The factors resulting from this analysis can be interpreted as multimorbidity patterns (ie, clusters of diagnoses frequently associated with each other), and each factor loading represents the association of the specific disease with a pattern. As a measure of model fit, we reported the proportion of variance of the data accounted for by the multimorbidity patterns. The extraction criterion for factors was a minimum eigenvalue of 1. Factor loadings of 0.30 or more were considered relevant and reported in the results. Since we assumed that multimorbidity factors were associated with each other, we used an oblique (oblimin) rotation of factor loading matrices.

On 31 December 2012, in Emilia-Romagna, patients with a single disease were 798 829 (21.2%), whereas patients with multimorbidity were 574 208 (15.3%). The prevalence of morbidity differed significantly by gender (men: 19.4%, women: 22.9%; \u03c7\u00b2=25 000, p<0.001), as well as the prevalence of multimorbidity (men: 15.1%, women: 15.4%; \u03c7\u00b2=85.38, p<0.001). However, in this latter case, the significance of the test seemed to be caused by the large size of the study population, rather than by the actual difference between the two prevalence values.",

            "text": "The Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) reported that, in 2012, multimorbidity affected 20.4% of the Italian population (49.4% in participants aged 54-74 years and 69.4% in participants aged \u226590 years) (http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/5471). These figures differ from those presented in this study for two possible reasons: first, Istat included in multimorbidity count some chronic diseases that we did not detect (ie, celiac disease, allergies, migraine and osteoporosis); second, the Istat survey is based on self-reported information, thus possibly overestimating the prevalence of some chronic health diseases. When we examined each disease separately we found, consistently with other studies, that hypertension, diabetes and depression were highly prevalent, 27 28 with some variation between genders (ie, hypertension and depression more common among women, and diabetes more common among men). In general, we found a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, depression, cerebrovascular disease, non-metastatic tumours, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and myocardial infarction-all diseases that, according to the literature, should be included in every multimorbidity index. 15 29 As expected, we found that multimorbidity was strongly associated with increasing age. This finding corroborates many other studies 2 3 30 31 and may be explained by the longer exposure and increased vulnerability in older persons to risk factors for chronic health problems. 3 Age-related multimorbidity has major financial and social implications, as populations are rapidly ageing in most countries, including developing countries and those in transition. Indeed, the burden of chronic disease is the biggest financial challenge to countries and healthcare systems worldwide. 32 Of interest, immigrants had fewer diseases than Italian citizens. A possible explanation is that immigrants, presumably of first generation and looking for manual jobs that require intense physical work, are on average healthier than native-born. This phenomenon has been defined as the 'healthy immigrant effect'. 33 34 However, it is more plausible that these figures reflect the wellknown lower access of immigrants to healthcare and particularly specialist healthcare. 35 Using factor analysis, we identified some relevant disease patterns. Comparing our results with those of other studies is difficult because of different diseases, data sources, populations and setting considered. Still, like Islam et al, 28 we found the tumours constitute a distinct pattern, probably because risk factors for cancer may be specific. Moreover, similarly to many other studies, 21 26 27 36 37 we found a strong association between cardiovascular, renal, pulmonary and cerebrovascular diseases, suggesting that this pattern is part of the natural biological and pathological course of these illnesses, such as inflammation, hypoxia, oxidative stress or ageing, and is related to general risk factors such as smoking or pollution. 38 In line with Barnett et al, 2 we also found that psychiatric disorders tended to correlate with each other and were not associated with age. Finally, we found a multimorbidity pattern composed of   liver diseases (ie, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis), AIDS/ HIV and substance use, which is consistent with evidence that liver and infective diseases are common in patients with substance use disorder.",

Although the evidence base for the management of multimorbidity appears to be thin and much more research is still needed, 8 it is now well recognised that best practice should focus on the prevention of common risk factors and an orientation of treatment towards the improvement of functional limitations. 21 These are core functions of primary care professionals, and particularly of generals practitioners, who are asked to have a broad knowledge base, be able to coordinate care across a range of different specialist services, have good judgement to balance competing priorities, inquire about patient preferences during a consultation and, as a whole, refine the treatment to multimorbid patients to promote better and more consistent management and self-management of the illnesses. 6 9 39 Therefore, the high prevalence of multimorbidity in older patients underscores the urgent need for providing these care interventions on a routine delivery system. The identification of clustering of conditions in patients with multimorbidity is no less important for three main reasons: 21 from an aetiological perspective, to understand what makes conditions tend to co-occur with the aim to prevent their development in the first place; from a clinical perspective, to identify therapeutic approaches that allow the tailoring of care for significant strata of people with a given condition or combination of conditions and from a policy perspective, to target more common disease combinations and orient the delivery of care with the aim to ensure that the resources match the needs of patients of the same cluster.",

            "text": "The implications of our study need to be interpreted in light of the study's limitations. First, the use of administrative data may have underestimated multimorbidity. In fact, during the observation period, a number of participants suffering from chronic diseases (in particular psychiatric disorders) may have never sought care, been hospitalised or been prescribed long-term drug therapies. Moreover, the underestimation of multimorbidity may have been differential, that is, more pronounced for some patients rather than others ( presumably older people and immigrants). However, in order to improve the accuracy of our estimates, we extended the observation period to several years and integrated different data sources, including hospital records and prescriptions, as suggested by other authors. 40 41 Second, we did not use antipsychotic prescriptions to identify patients with dementia because these drugs are quite non-specific in their effect and are commonly prescribed also for a large number of severe psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, mania, agitated psychotic depression and paranoid disorders. Third, hypertension and depression were traced using some drugs that are prescribed also for heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and neuropathic pain, thus increasing the sensitivity of the disease count but lowering the specificity. Fourth, it is possible that a study period of 10 years, from 2003 to 2012, was not long enough to detect thoroughly all chronic diseases, especially for the elderly, once again possibly underestimating the number of morbid and multimorbid patients; an excessively long observation period, however, may lead to the inclusion of conditions with a prolonged course but which are not active at the time of the study. 23 It is also worth noting that our study included the periods preceding and following the global financial crisis, and this may have overestimated the prevalence of some diseases which we investigated only in the post-crisis period such as depression and anxiety; for the same reason, estimates may have been inflated to some degree for younger people. Fifth, we did not include in the multimorbidity count a number of relevant conditions mentioned in systematic reviews, such as osteoporosis, angina, arthritis, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid disease, anaemia, dyslipidaemia and obesity. We are well aware that this issue leads to an underestimation of multimorbidity and makes comparison with other studies difficult; still, our choice was conditioned by the fact that these diseases are not present in the algorithms developed by Charlson and Elixhauser, are managed to a large extent by general practitioners and are characterised by differences and variety in the case definition. For all these reasons, the multimorbidity prevalence estimates calculated in this study should be interpreted as the 'lower boundary' for the proportion of participants suffering from two or more chronic health disorders; to summarise, in Emilia-Romagna, the prevalence of multimorbid adults is not lower than 15% (40% among the elderly).",
