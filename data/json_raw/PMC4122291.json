            "text": "Quantum-confined nanostructures are considered 'artificial atoms' because the wavefunctions of their charge carriers resemble those of atomic orbitals. For multiple-domain heterostructures, however, carrier wavefunctions are more complex and still not well understood. We have prepared a unique series of cation-exchanged Hg x Cd 1 \u00c0 x Te quantum dots (QDs) and seven epitaxial core-shell QDs and measured their first and second exciton peak oscillator strengths as a function of size and chemical composition. A major finding is that carrier locations can be quantitatively mapped and visualized during shell growth or cation exchange simply using absorption transition strengths. These results reveal that a broad range of quantum heterostructures with different internal structures and band alignments exhibit distinct carrier localization patterns that can be used to further improve the performance of optoelectronic devices and enhance the brightness of QD probes for bioimaging.",

            "text": "emiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have recently attracted broad attention for applications in bioimaging, light-emitting devices, photovoltaics and quantum computing [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] . Compared with bulk semiconductor crystals, these nanocrystals exhibit unique optical and electronic properties, including size-tunable bandgaps and fluorescence emission, ultrafast charge-transfer rates and decreased lasing thresholds [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] . These properties largely arise from the quantum confinement effect, in which electronic charge carriers (electrons and holes) are spatially confined because of the small crystal size, similar to a spherical 'particle in a box.' This confinement results in quantized electronic energy levels that are analogous to discrete electronic transitions of atoms in the gas phase. However, this analogy becomes much more complex for quantum-confined heterostructures containing multiple chemical or structural domains. In these composite nanomaterials, separate regions have distinct potential energies that shape the spatial distribution and transport behaviour of different charge carriers. For example, in core-shell heterostructures with a 'type-I' band alignment, the potential energy of the electron and hole is lowest in the same domain (for example, the core) and thus the electron and hole are colocalized, resulting in a high probability of radiative recombination and a fluorescence quantum efficiency that can approach unity [18][19][20] . In contrast, in core-shell heterostructures with 'type-II' band alignments, the potential energy minima for the electron and hole are in different domains, resulting in charge carrier separation, longer excited state lifetimes and broad wavelength tunability 21 . It is thus critically important to determine and control the spatial distribution patterns of charge carriers; however, at present there are few experimental approaches available for such fundamental studies. Scanning tunnelling microscopy with spectroscopy has been used to image specific wavefunctions but the technique is very challenging and has low throughput 22 . Computational modelling studies also provide insight; however, alone they are of only limited utility as continuum models do not account for microscopic structural attributes and immense computational power is needed to account for atomistic effects when large numbers of atoms are involved 23 .",

Specifically, we have prepared a unique series of cation-exchanged Hg x Cd 1 \u00c0 x Te heterostructures, for which quantum mechanical calculations are simplified and the electronic transition probabilities are solely dependent on the electron-hole overlap integral. For this series of heterostructures, we have experimentally measured the 1st and 2nd exciton transition intensities (oscillator strengths) as a function of both particle size and chemical composition. The results show that the oscillator strength of the 1st exciton peak is dependent on the relative electron-hole overlap, while the intensity of second exciton peak measures the absolute spatial localizations of the electron and hole. We have further carried out extensive work, both experimental and theoretical, on seven common core/shell heterostructures, demonstrating that the relationship between electronic transition strengths and charge-carrier distributions is generalizable to a broad range of core-shell and alloyed nanostructures. These fundamental insights are critical for patterning the shapes and spatial locations of charge carrier wavefunctions and for funneling oscillator strength into specific optical transitions, which will help to exploit the novel properties of quantum nanostructures for future use in optoelectronic devices, quantum computing, solar energy conversion as well as bioimaging.",

In a single-electron hydrogenic atom (for example, H, He \u00fe , Li 2 \u00fe ) in the gas phase, the electron energy levels are quantized, leading to a discrete set of electronic orbitals (s, p, d, and so on) with distinct absorption transitions. In semiconductor QDs, the crystalline lattice of atoms provides a potential energy well for excited-state charge carriers (electrons and holes), which have analogous wavefunction shapes. Figure 1a depicts the lowest-energy electronic energy states for the electron (1S) and hole (1S) in addition to the next highest energy state of the hole (2S) in a pure cadmium telluride (CdTe) QD; the shapes resemble the corresponding 1s and 2s atomic orbitals. Figure 1b depicts plots of the wavefunctions (c) and radial distribution functions (RDF, c 2 r 2 ) of these carriers based on the EMA 24 . The 1S electron exhibits greater spatial confinement than the 1S hole because the effective mass of an electron (m e \u00bc 0.090) is much smaller than that of a hole (m HH , heavy-hole effective mass is equal to 0.83; see Supplementary Table 1). As a result, the 1S electron density is distributed further away from the QD centre than the 1S hole state (see RDF plots). Figure 1c shows a typical electronic absorption spectrum for a QD composed of II-VI materials (here CdTe), showing multiple distinct electronic transitions. Through comparisons with quantum mechanical models, the absorption peaks have been  and (c) steady-state absorption spectrum showing the 1st exciton 1S(h)-1S(e) and the 2nd exciton 2S(h)-1S(e) transitions.

The 1st transition, 1S(h)-1S(e), arises from light absorption by an electron in the highest energy valence band (VB) state to transition to the lowest energy conduction band (CB) state 25,26 . This transition is also known as the 1st exciton peak, as it results in a bound electron-hole pair, a ground-state exciton. In the resulting 1S(e)1S(h) exciton, both carriers occupy 1S wavefunctions that substantially overlap in space. The 2nd exciton peak, 2S(h)-1S(e), arises from the excitation of an electron in the next highest VB level, again to the lowest energy CB level 27,28 . This results in a 1S(e)2S(h) exciton in which the hole occupies a 2S wavefunction. Both the 1S(h) and 2S(h) wavefunctions are spherically symmetric; however, the 2S(h) has a spherical nodal surface with zero electronic density separating regions of opposite polarity, as indicated by red and blue colours in Fig. 1a,b. Therefore, whereas the 1S(e)1S(h) exciton has strong electron-hole overlap, the 1S(e)2S(h) exciton overlap is small because of contributions from both constructive and destructive interference between the 1S electron and the two domains of opposite polarity of the 2S hole. As discussed below, the first and second exciton wavefunctions are greatly influenced by the nanocrystal structure and composition, and together can be used to map the spatial distributions of charge carriers in quantum nanostructures.",

            "text": "Electronic transitions and oscillator strengths. We are interested in measuring the oscillator strengths of the first and second excitonic transitions. Figure 2 depicts the two-step process to extract these values from QD electronic absorption spectra. The first step is to determine the electronic transition energies from often broad or apparently featureless absorption spectra, and then reconstruct the spectrum from a sum of Gaussian peaks, with integrated areas corresponding to transition oscillator strengths. Transition energy extraction is limited by spectral overlap between adjacent peaks. Peak width is a function of sample homogeneity (size, shape and composition), transition energy and homogeneous broadening effects. As a result, significant peak overlap is observed even for QD samples that are considered structurally homogeneous by current standards. Moreover, even if the spectral peaks are distinct, their maxima do not necessarily correspond with the true peak energy because contributing shoulders from neighbouring peaks can shift the observed peak centroid. To overcome this problem, we have used differential absorption spectroscopy (DAS) for mathematical narrowing of convolved peaks: even order derivatives (for example, 2nd, 4th derivatives) have substantially narrower peak profiles than those of the zeroth-order spectra (see Supplementary Methods for more details). On the basis of analyses of synthetic spectra of QDs with known Gaussian transition energies, we have determined the spectral parameters for which transition energy and oscillator strength can be accurately measured. Figure 3a,b shows synthetic spectra of two sizes of CdTe nanocrystals with a range of size dispersions, with vertical lines indicating input transition energies, numbered 1-6. We extracted the transition energies using the 4th derivative: Fig. 3c,d shows that the first exciton energy (blue curves) is at least 99% accurate (within 20-30 meV depending on size) even when the size dispersion is as large as 20% relative s.d. in diameter (Dd \u00c1 d \u00c0 1 ) . The determined energy of the second exciton transitions using DAS is at least 99% accurate for Dd \u00c1 d \u00c0 1 o11% (red curves, open circle markers). Spectral reconstruction through least squares fitting further improves the transition energy accuracy. Thus, we find that it is not necessary to determine the peak energy with very high accuracy but rather it is more important to determine the accurate number of peaks within a specific spectral window (see Supplementary Discussion). The extracted energy provides an 'initial guess' for the energy; by allowing the energies to shift, the curve-fitting algorithm finds the original peaks. We show that even when the extracted 4th derivative is inaccurate by 90 meV, the fitting algorithm finds the original peak, within several meV (compare the open and closed circle markers in Fig. 3c,d), and the resulting energies are at least 99% accurate for Dd \u00c1 d \u00c0 1 r15%.",

            "text": "We have also investigated whether experimental band narrowing through photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy, rather than through DAS, could improve the resolution of contributing absorption peaks. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, the low energy peaks were similar to those of the DAS spectra; this is consistent with previous PLE spectral analysis of CdTe nanocrystals by Zhong et al. 29 , as well as with theoretical predictions by Efros et al. 27 (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Figure 3e,f depicts the error in calculated oscillator strength of the first three transitions of these nanocrystals, determined through least squares fitting. At low size dispersions, all spectra are accurately fit, but deviations arise with increasing size dispersion. Higher accuracy is obtained for larger nanocrystals compared with smaller nanocrystals with the same size dispersion, as peaks are less 'hidden' by the first exciton for larger sizes. The 1st and 2nd exciton oscillator strengths are found to be accurate (within 5% of the input value) for 3.0-nm nanocrystals with Dd \u00c1 d \u00c0 1 r12% and for 6.7-nm nanocrystals with Dd \u00c1 d \u00c0 1 o14%. The corresponding spectra are marked in red in Fig. 3a,b. It is surprising that even for these somewhat featureless spectra, the subtle changes in curvature provide sufficient information about the underlying peaks, which allow us to determine the number and strength of peaks. All QDs analysed in this paper have spectral bandwidths narrower than these threshold values, such that their transition energies and oscillator strengths are determined with Z99% and Z95% accuracy, respectively.",

Large CdTe nanocrystals form core-shell structures, as determined by Raman scattering ( Supplementary  Fig. 8): the CdTe phonon modes remain after substantial cation exchange but are broadened because of reduced domain size, and new broad scattering modes arise corresponding to those of HgTe. Furthermore, a kinetic analysis of exchange reactions reveals that for larger nanocrystals (45 nm), exchange occurs rapidly (minutes) until a monolayer has been formed, after which the exchange rate is substantially reduced ( Supplementary Fig. 9). This is not the case for smaller nanocrystals, for which exchange beyond a monolayer is rapid; these particles have a dynamic structure with significantly higher ion mobility that leads to homogeneous alloying, as described below.",

These changes depend on whether the final structure is a core-shell or alloy (Fig. 4a). The bulk bandgap energy of CdTe is 1.5 eV, whereas that of HgTe is \u00c0 0.15 eV (a near-zero bandgap in which the bottom of the CB is almost aligned with the top of the VB). Thus, as shown in Fig. 4b (energy band structures based on EMA calculations), cation substitution of Cd 2 \u00fe by Hg 2 \u00fe in CdTe nanocrystals leads to a decrease in bandgap energy and altered degree of carrier confinement. For homogeneous alloys, the CB shifts to lower energy and the VB shifts to higher energy. This is not the case for the core-shell products, for which two separate domains emerge: the electron now has a lower energy level in the shell region that results in a substantial reduction in bandgap energy. Although the hole well is also deepened, the 1S and 2S hole levels do not significantly change in energy relative to the CdTe nanocrystals or redistribute to the shell because the small effective mass of the hole in HgTe (m HH \u00bc 0.03) offsets changes in potential well depth. Thus, the electron is redistributed to the shell region, whereas hole states remain distributed throughout the nanocrystal, resulting in a pseudo-type II band alignment with a spatially indirect bandgap.",

For core CdTe nanocrystals, the 1S(e) and 1S(h) states of the 1st exciton initially strongly overlap (overlap integral F 1 \u00bc 0.94, Fig. 4c), whereas for the 2nd exciton, 1S(e) overlaps both with regions of negative and positive polarity of 2S(h), yielding a small net overlap (F 2 \u00bc 0.25, Fig. 4d). If the resulting Hg x Cd 1 \u00c0 x Te nanocrystal is a homogeneous alloy, the overlaps do not substantially change compared with the CdTe nanocrystal (F 1 \u00bc 0.94, F 2 \u00bc 0.27). However, for the core-shell CdTe/HgTe nanocrystals, the electron migrates to the shell region and the hole remains distributed throughout the nanocrystal so the 1st exciton overlap decreases (to F 1 \u00bc 0.66) and the 2nd exciton overlap increases (to F 2 \u00bc 0.56) because the electron moves away from the 2S hole node to increase overlap with a region of like polarity and reduce overlap with regions of opposite polarity. Thus, for cation-exchanged core-shell nanostructures, the 1st exciton transition strength is predicted to decrease and the 2nd exciton strength will increase (more than twofold); these will not substantially change for an alloyed structure. This decrease in oscillator strength of the 1st exciton peak has been widely reported for type-II heterostructures 21,31,32 . However, the 2nd exciton peak has not been explored in this context but should be a more specific and sensitive 'reporter' for localization because of the capacity to either decrease or increase depending on small shifts in wavefunction distribution. Whereas the 1st exciton peak oscillator strength can reveal a relative change in electron-hole overlap, changes in the 2nd exciton peak provide a sensitive probe for the absolute spatial localization of the electron or hole in the core or shell.",

Figure 5a shows that mercury exchange of 3.2-nm CdTe QDs leads to a monotonic shift of the absorption spectra to lower energies, and the major excitonic transitions remain discrete and with similar intensities and bandwidths (the molar QD concentration is identical for all spectra plotted on the same chart herein), indicating uniform cation exchange across the nanocrystal ensemble. Different trends were observed when the same experiment was performed on larger nanocrystals (6.2 nm, Fig. 5b): the 1st exciton transition initially exhibited little change in energy while absorption at higher energies increased. In addition, the 2nd exciton peak increased in intensity and merged with the 1st exciton peak. This trend was similar for 8.4-nm nanocrystals ( Supplementary Fig. 10).",

For small nanocrystals (o5 nm), all of the CdTe core transitions shifted to lower energies nearly linearly with increasing Hg content ( Supplementary Fig. 11a). This is expected for homogeneous alloys with similar VB structures, that is, common-anion alloys (the VB predominantly arises from the anion p orbitals). In contrast, larger nanocrystals exhibited nonlinear transition trends with increasing Hg content, with several peaks becoming too closely spaced in energy to be distinguished ( Supplementary  Fig. 11b). To reconstruct the band edges for oscillator strength calculation, at least four peaks were used for small nanocrystals and at least seven peaks were used for large nanocrystals (see Supplementary Methods) and the oscillator strengths of the 1st and 2nd exciton transitions (f 1 and f 2 , respectively) were calculated from the integrated peak areas 33 . Figure 5c shows oscillator strengths per QD for pure CdTe nanocrystals (x \u00bc 0, no mercury) with diameters between 2 and 12 nm. The oscillator strength of the 1st exciton transition is nearly constant with size (f 1 \u00bc 1.33 \u00b1 0.10), as predicted by the EMA (Fig. 4b). These values are in close agreement with those found previously for CdTe nanocrystals 34 , and follow trends previously observed for CdS 35 and InAs 36 .",

The disproportionate concentration of oscillator strength in the 1S(h)-1S(e) transition for small nanocrystals compared with the 2S(h)-1S(e) and higher energy transitions is a result of the near-independence of the 1st exciton overlap with QD size. This is in contrast to the 2nd exciton, for which small changes in electron or hole confinement lead to substantial changes in net overlap because of the presence of the 2S hole node. It is notable that the experimental trend in the 2nd exciton oscillator strength could not be reproduced in EMA models unless band interactions were taken into account. The resulting wavefunctions showed that interactions become important for larger sizes, as the relatively unconfined 2S hole attracts the 1S electron closer to the centre of the nanocrystal as the node spreads farther from the centre, increasing net overlap with increasing size.",

For nonsperical CdTe, EMA calculations show a roughly fivefold smaller splitting energy compared with that of prolate CdSe 38 .

We investigated three cation exchange methods: (1) in water using mercury-thioglycerol complexes, (2) in nonpolar solvents using mercury octanethiolate and (3) in nonpolar solvents using highly reactive mercury acetate. Methods 1 and 2 allowed slow, controlled exchange yielding spectral shifts over hours to days, whereas method 3 resulted in a rapid spectral red-shift in just seconds; we designate these two exchange regimes 'slow' or 'fast.' For large nanocrystals, the result of fast and slow exchange was similar: f 1 decreased and f 2 increased with increasing mercury content (Fig. 5e). This trend was anticipated for core-shell nanocrystals: in Fig. 5f, solid lines depict EMA predictions for core-shell nanocrystals and dotted lines show homogeneous alloys, which change very little with increasing mercury content. For small nanocrystals, slow and fast exchange modes were markedly different. For slow exchange, f 1 and f 2 only changed slightly with increasing mercury content ( Supplementary Fig. 12), in accord with the formation of a homogeneous alloy, whereas for fast exchange, f 1 decreased and f 2 increased, reflecting a core-shell structure. For fast exchange, f 1 and f 2 slowly approached their original values, suggesting redistribution of mercury to the core and suggesting that the cation exchange process is kinetically controlled by a balance between surface exchange and diffusion/alloying within the nanocrystal, which is consistent with our kinetic exchange experiments ( Supplementary Fig. 9).",

            "text": "Diagrams of charge carrier localization. We next determined how oscillator strength analyses could be used as a generalizable tool for a wide variety of core-shell QDs. Validation with cationexchanged Hg x Cd 1 \u00c0 x Te was a critical step because the photophysics of this system are simple: the total number of oscillators (that is, atoms or bonding electrons) and the size does not change, and thus f is solely dependent on the electron-hole overlap integral. In addition, this system is nearly free from lattice strain because CdTe and HgTe have similar cubic lattice constants. This is important because strain is expected to strongly impact the optical and electronic properties of lattice-mismatched core-shell systems because of alterations to bond lengths that shift electronic energy bands, warp bands at interfaces and split degenerate hole states 11,32 . Typically, core-shell materials are grown through epitaxial deposition of a shell on a preformed core, such that the total number of oscillators and the nanocrystal size change, and strain effects are often dramatic when using lattice-mismatched materials 11,31 . To examine these effects with respect to f 1 and f 2 , we prepared seven core-shell nanocrystals starting from highly homogeneous cores: CdTe/CdSe, CdSe/CdS, CdSe/ZnTe, CdSe/ZnS, CdS/CdSe, CdS/ZnSe and CdS/ZnS. Similar to CdTe, the 1st and 2nd exciton transitions of CdS and CdSe were previously assigned as the 1S(h)-1S(e) and 2S(h)-1S(e) transitions, respectively. So that we did not have to calculate absolute oscillator strengths, we simply calculated relative oscillator strengths (ROSs) per QD, defined as: f rel was calculated from concentration-normalized absorption spectra obtained during shell growth. Spectra were reconstructed through least-squares fitting of a sum of Gaussian curves to determine f rel 1 and f rel 2 . As shown in Fig. 6, trends were clear for specific electron-hole localization regimes with just 0-1.2 ML of shell growth, and match expected oscillator strength relationships based on the EMA model. Homoepitaxy (simply growing CdTe on CdTe cores, Fig. 6a,e) did not alter f rel 1 but resulted in a monotonic increase in f rel 2 , in accord with Fig. 5c,d. Type I QDs with strong localization of the electron and hole in the core showed little change in f rel 1 and f rel 2 with increasing shell thickness (CdSe/ZnS, panels b,f). Type II h/e QDs with core-localized hole and shell-localized electron showed a strong decrease in f rel 1 and a strong increase in f rel 2 with increasing shell thickness (CdTe/CdSe, panels c,g), much like CdTe/HgTe nanocrystals with large cores. Type II e/h QDs with core-localized electron and shell-localized hole showed little change in f rel 1 and a strong decrease in f rel 2 with increasing shell thickness (CdSe/ZnTe, panels d,h) as the 2S hole migrates towards the shell, increasing overlap between the electron wavefunction maximum and the hole node. We also investigated type I core/shell QDs for which both the electron and hole localize to the shell, often called quantum wells (CdS/CdSe, Supplementary Fig. 13d,h).",

A capping experiment starts with 'origin' coordinates of (1,1) for the core nanocrystal, and shell growth results in a trajectory moving away from this initial point along a specific path of carrier localization regimes. These plots clearly distinguish between the two type II regimes (e/h versus h/e), which is not possible solely through an examination of the 1st exciton peak, and distinguishes the two type I regimes for which the carriers are localized in the core (eh/o) or in the shell (o/eh). The magnitude of localization is also depicted; that is, significant delocalization of carriers from the core results in trajectories leading far from the origin compared with pseudo-type II regimes that remain close to the origin. Indeed, CdSe/CdS QDs ( Supplementary Fig. 13c,g), previously shown to allow partial leakage of just the electron into the shell 39 , occupy ROS chart regions between type-II h/e and type-I eh/o regions, whereas CdS/ZnS QDs ( Supplementary Fig. 13b,f) allow partial leakage of just the hole into the shell and are intermediate between the type-II e/h and type-I o/eh chart regions. Thus, there is theoretically a continuum of possible core-shell combinations of charge carrier localization that can be explored using various material combinations, and this methodology provides rapid analysis of localization of the resulting wavefunctions.",

The former generally indicates a decrease in quantum confinement as the exciton spreads over a larger number of atoms, involving more oscillators in the transition (for example, homoepitaxial growth of CdSe/CdSe or CdTe/CdTe). The latter regime indicates a decrease in the number of atoms sharing the wavefunction or a net increase in confinement.

Other spectral signatures also become apparent but only after thicker shells are grown. For example, for type II e/h QDs (Fig. 6d) the 1st exciton does not substantially shift in energy, and the fluorescence quantum yield is very low (o1%). For type-II h/e QDs (Fig. 6c), the 1st exciton peak shifts substantially and the quantum yield can remain high (20% or more). These regimes also exhibit distinct signatures in intraband absorption in the infrared, although such experiments require specialized instruments 40 . It is noteworthy that core-shell materials in which the shell bandgap is smaller than that of the core are problematic to analyse when the shell thickness is greater than approximately one monolayer because of new transitions that arise near the band edge and overlap with the 1st and 2nd exciton peaks. It should be possible to overcome this problem by acquiring spectra at lower temperatures and validating transition energies with PLE spectroscopy.",

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated that the 1st and 2nd exciton transitions in steady-state absorption spectra of QD heterostructures are sensitive probes for electron and hole localization. Minute changes to electron and hole localization are reflected in alterations in the oscillator strengths of these transitions and can be conveniently visualized on an f rel 1 \u00c0 f rel 2 plot to map the locations of charge carriers during shell growth. When coupled with a simple quantum mechanical model, these spectral signatures can reveal detailed structural changes to the nanocrystal that may not be clearly distinguishable using advanced material characterization techniques, as exemplified for the analysis of Hg x Cd 1 \u00c0 x Te QDs. These methods should improve our understanding of confinement in complex heterostructures that are of considerable current interest derived from cation exchange 30,[41][42][43] and seeded growth [44][45][46] just by monitoring the absorption spectrum. We expect these methods to be widely applicable to four-coordinate direct-bandgap II-VI and III-V materials, and extrapolation to other materials, such as the six-coordinate IV-VI family, should require just an analysis of the 1S-1S transition and any higher order transition with spherical symmetry. Examples here used the most simplistic spherical nanocrystals and wavefunction symmetries; novel properties are expected to arise in structures containing multiple domains with different shapes, such as tetrapod structures in which low energy state are geometrically similar to sp 3 atomic orbitals 47 . This new localization information will be particularly valuable for distinguishing the degree to which the electron and hole are spatially localized in electronic device components to maximize or minimize transfer of particular charge carriers, to maximize or minimize recombination and for determining the degree to which multicomponent structures alloy at their interface. This methodology does not require specialized equipment, and analysis can be easily automated for the observation of incremental structural changes, simply requiring a homogeneous core nanocrystal. These analyses will also be valuable for wavefunction engineering applications to precisely pattern the shapes and spatial locations of charge carrier wavefunctions, and to funnel oscillator strength into specific optical transitions.",

After resuspension in a solution of 1 mM thioglycerol in deionized water (pH 11), the nanocrystals were sonicated, centrifuged at 7,000 g for 15 min to remove aggregates and finally passed through a 0.2-mm filter. For mercury exchange, a freshly prepared solution of mercury perchlorate (1 mM) in deionized water was quickly added with rapid stirring to the suspension of nanocrystals (20 mM). Nanocrystals were purified using a centrifugal filtration device (5 kDa molecular weight cutoff).",
