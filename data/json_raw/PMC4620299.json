Moreover, maximum 25% of all depressed patients receive drug therapy. 1 Due to poor medication compliance in depressed patients, and high rate of recurrence, nutrition related factors might have an important role in the prevention and treatment of major depression. 2 The relationship between depression and inadequate nutrient intake has been reported in many studies. 2 For example, tryptophan, 6 B vitamins group, 7-9 magnesium, 10,11 zinc, 12 Omega 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. [13][14][15] The association between diseases and single or multiple nutrients is the main focus of traditional analyses in nutritional epidemiology. This type of analysis is relatively valuable, but methodologically, it has several limitations. People do not consume one nutrient at a time. The various combinations of nutrients in foods may have diminishing or exacerbating effects. Besides, the effect of a single nutrient may be hard to detect, while at the same time, the collective effects of some nutrients in a dietary pattern are easily measurable. Moreover, single nutrient analysis usually changes by the effect of dietary patterns. 16 Furthermore, because of the interaction between dietary components, adjustment for these factors in multivariable analyses may not eliminate all their confounding effects. 17 The main focus of this study is to investigate the relationship between depression and dietary patterns, rather than one or more specific nutrients. 18 Among different countries, a few studies have shown an association of their diverse dietary patterns with an increased risk of depression, [19][20][21] but with controversial results. 19,20 Moreover, regarding the effects of racial, geographic, environmental, cultural, and social conditions on the relationship between dietary pattern and depression, it is crucial to perform these investigations in various countries. 22 Besides, advising people to follow a special dietary pattern seems more feasible than to intake a specific nutrient, such as vitamin D or folic acid. Therefore, in this study, we decided to compare dietary patterns between depressed and healthy people.",

We used orthogonal varimax rotation to identify major dietary patterns, based on number of food groups. To determine the number of dietary patterns, we used the eigenvalue and Scree plot. The Scree plot is a plot of the eigenvalues of derived factors and its value was equal to 1.5. The factor score for each pattern was calculated by summing intakes of food groups weighted by their factor score matrix.

There was no significant difference between two groups, in family size, birth rank, years of education, smoking cigarettes and hookah per week, weight, height, marital and menopausal status, roommate addicted to alcohol, depressed friend, and daily energy intake. However, other covariates were significantly different among case and control groups (Table 1 and 2). The mean of physical activity and years of education in patients were less than in healthy people, but the mean of previous depression morbidity and anxiety score in patients were more than in healthy people. The frequency of family history of depression, childhood history of traumatic events, history of evil events in the last 6 months, and non-depression drugs intake in patients were more than in healthy people. Depression risk is the least in the families with 2 children compared with families with 0, 1 and \u22653 children. In addition, this risk is the most in subjects with periods of unemployment more than 6 months in the last 5 years, and in house workers and retired participants. Moreover, a decreased depression risk was found by increasing BMI.  We defined 26 food groups (Table 3), and assigned each food item in these groups, on the basis of nutrients content similarities. By using factor analysis, we identified two major dietary patterns: the healthy dietary pattern (high in fruits, cruciferous, yellow, green leafy and other vegetables, low fat dairy, whole grains, nuts, and olives) and unhealthy dietary  Table 4. Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile had significantly lower OR for depression in healthy dietary pattern, and higher OR for depression in unhealthy dietary pattern ( ",

According to previous studies, a number of nutrients such as omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins D, E, B6, B12, and folate, magnesium, zinc, iron, copper, calcium, and tryptophan are important in the prevention and treatment of depression, and all of food groups in healthy dietary pattern including vegetables, fruits, dairy products, nuts, olive oil and green olive, fish, legumes and whole grains are rich in these nutrients 2. A specific mechanism is proposed for each nutrient, or a group of nutrients. For example, tryptophan, as a dietary amino acid, is the precursor of brain serotonin. The individuals with lower level of brain serotonin are considered to be vulnerable to af-fective disorders, such as depression. Synthesis of serotonin is limited by the inaccessibility of tryptophan. 44 Omega 3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids produce anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, which reduce the levels of pro inflammatory cytokines in depressed patients. 45 Also they have a role in brain functioning and serotonin neurotransmission (e.g., providing fluidity to neurons cell membrane). 39 The direct effect of nutritional factors on neural physiology is been discussed. In experimental studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were lowered by an unhealthy diet within a short period of time. This effect was independent of obesity or nutritional deficits. BDNF is assumed to have a central role in depressive illness. It also protects neurons from oxidative stress and encourages the neurogenesis. Therefore, diet may influence psychiatric status through regulation of the BDNF expression. 19 In conclusion, an inverse association between depression and healthy dietary patterns is largely expected.",
