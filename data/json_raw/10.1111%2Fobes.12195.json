            "text": "We investigate the asymptotic and finite sample properties of the most widely used information criteria for co-integration rank determination in 'partial' systems, i.e. in co-integrated vector autoregressive (VAR) models where a subset of variables of interest is modelled conditional on another subset of variables. The asymptotic properties of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Hannan-Quinn information criterion (HQC) are established, and consistency of BIC and HQC is proved. Notably, the consistency of BIC and HQC is robust to violations of weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables with respect to the co-integration parameters. More precisely, BIC and HQC recover the true co-integration rank from the partial system analysis also when the conditional model does not convey all information about the co-integration parameters. This result opens up interesting possibilities for practitioners who can now determine the co-integration rank in partial systems without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables. A Monte Carlo experiment based on a large dimensional data generating process shows that BIC and HQC applied in partial systems perform reasonably well in small samples and comparatively better than 'traditional'methods for co-integration rank determination. We further show the usefulness of our approach and the benefits of the conditional system analysis in two empirical illustrations, both based on the estimation of VAR systems on US quarterly data. Overall, our analysis shows the gains of combining information criteria with partial system analysis.

The idea of the conditional analysis is that the dimensionality of the system is reduced, and, when conditioning is valid, co-integration tests may have better power properties. The 'partial system' approach proves to be useful in situations where (i) the dimension of the whole VAR system p := dim(X t ), X t := (Y t , Z t ), is large relative to the sample size T ; (ii) the practitioner is essentially interested in modelling Y t and it is known that Z t contributes to the long-run equilibrium of the system but either the theory is silent about the short run properties of Z t , or the scope of the analysis does not require modelling Z t explicitly; (iii) the time series used for Z t are considered poor proxies of the corresponding theoretical variables they should measure, especially as concerns their transitory dynamics.",

The special case where the partial (conditional) model for Y t given Z t contains as much information about the parameters of interest as the full system is when Z t is weakly exogenous, see Engle, Hendry and Richard (1983). Under the weak exogeneity of Z t for the co-integrating parameters, HJNR derive the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test for cointegrating rank in the partial model, and provide tables of critical values. When Z t is not weakly exogenous for the co-integrating parameters, the conditional model for Y t given Z t conveys only partial information about the long-run structure of the system.",

            "text": "Actually, the requirement of weak exogeneity of Z t can nullify the benefits of the partial system analysis as suggested in HJNR and limit its usefulness in applied work. On the one hand, when weak exogeneity of Z t fails, the practitioner cannot apply the asymptotic critical values tabulated in HJNR and must resort to the full system analysis. On the other hand, it is difficult to check the hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t efficiently without a full system analysis or disregarding the model for Z t . Urbain (1992) shows that 'traditional' orthogonality tests (Pesaran and Smith, 1990) are not sufficient to address the issue of weak exogeneity in error-correction models, see also Boswijk and Urbain (1997). It is not surprising, therefore, that despite conditional (structural) error-correction models have been widely applied in applied work, only seldom the partial system approach has been used for inference on the co-integration rank, see Doornik, Hendry and Nielsen (1998), B\u00e5rdsen and Fisher (1999), Bruggeman, Donati and Warne (2003), and Johansen (1992b) for an early example. In empirical studies where a (structural) conditional system for Y t given Z t is used, the co-integration rank is typically either assumed to be known, or is assumed to be inferred from a full system analysis in a previous stage, see e.g. Boswijk (1995) and Ericsson (1995).",

Our main result is that the use of either BIC or HQC in partial systems yields weakly consistent estimates of the true co-integration rank (the same result does not apply to the AIC). Compared to HJNR, the suggested approach does not require the use of tables of critical values: the selected co-integration rank is the one which minimizes BIC or HQC across rank r = 0, 1,\u2026, p Y , where p Y := dim(Y t ). Notably, we prove the consistency of BIC and HQC irrespective of whether Z t is weakly exogeneous or not. The main implication of this result is that the practitioner can in fact disregard the marginal model for Z t without pretesting or being concerned with the weak exogeneity of Z t . BIC and HQC select asymptotically the 'true' co-integration rank from the conditional model of Y t given Z t , and perform reasonably well in finite samples. Thus, our approach to co-integration rank determination fully restores the main benefits of the partial system analysis.",

            "text": "We document the advantages of our approach in finite samples by a set of Monte Carlo experiments. We investigate co-integration rank determination by information criteria in the partial system approach and compare results with those obtained with the full system approach. We consider two scenarios: one where the conditioning variables Z t are weakly exogenous with respect to the co-integration parameters, and the other where the weak exogeneity constraint does not hold. We show that, under weak exogeneity, BIC tends to outperform 'traditional' co-integration rank tests in both full and conditional systems. The selection frequency of the null hypothesis of co-integration rank equal to the true co-integration rank delivered by HJRN's sequential test is remarkably inferior to the corresponding selection frequencies provided by BIC when Z t is weakly exogenous for the co-integration parameters. Conversely, when the hypothesis of weak exogeneity is not valid, BIC tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank in small sample sizes. Instead, HQC in partial systems outperforms its analogue in full systems, irrespective of Z t being weakly exogenous or not. That is, its selection frequencies are roughly the same in the two cases and the finite sample performance tends to be better than Johansen's (1996) sequential procedure in the full (unconditional) VAR system. Quite surprisingly, the results from the Monte Carlo experiments also show that the violation of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity has only a limited impact on the finite sample performance of HJNR's sequential test, although the associated critical values are tabulated under the maintained hypothesis of exogeneity. In particular, when the conditioning variables are not weakly exogenous for the co-integration parameters, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure perform in partial systems and in samples of lengths typically available to practitioners no worse than their full system analogues. Thus, despite ignoring the marginal model for Z t may imply a loss of information on the adjustment mechanisms at work in the whole system, the benefits of reduced dimensionality tends to compensate possible power losses when HQC is used. Interestingly, our Monte Carlo experiments also suggest that the finite sample performance of HQC and BIC (as well as HJNR's sequential procedure) is still satisfactory when VAR disturbances are driven by GARCH-type components. This robustness finding lines up with what Cavaliere, Rahbek and Taylor (2010) and CDRT have shown to be the case in full system analyses.",

We show that co-integration rank determination from the conditional model for Y t given Z t delivers, for suitable choices of Z t , reliable results relative to the full system analysis.

In particular, when T = 100 (T = 200) the selection frequency of the 'true' rank for BIC drops to 41.4%, 33.4% and 27.7% (80.1%, 71.1% and 63.2%) for p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. As predicted by the results in Theorem 1, this effect tends to disappear as T increases: similarly to the case of weak exogeneity in Table 1, when T = 1, 000 BIC always selects r = r 0 = 1, even when the weak exogeneity hypothesis is not valid. Conversely, the HQC performs similarly to the case of weak exogeneity and still outperforms its counterpart in the (unconditional) full system (right-panel of Table  2). In particular, HQC selects r = r 0 = 1 only 49.7% (82.8%) of the time in the full system when T = 100 (T = 200), while these frequencies are 69.5%, 57.2% and 52.5% (89.6%, 84% and 83%) in partial systems for p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Moreover, these results are very close to (and, in some cases, even outperform) the corresponding results under weak exogeneity (cf. Table 1). These results highlight that the HQC is not severely affected by the violation of the weak exogeneity hypothesis of the conditioning set. Quite surprisingly, also the performance of the HJNR's sequential test does not appear to be strongly affected by the lack of weak exogeneity of Z t as we would expect, given that the critical values reported in table 5 of HJNR are tabulated under the weak exogeneity assumption. Moreover, HJNR's sequential test displays a less marked tendency to overestimate the 'true' co-integration rank than Johansen's sequential procedure in the (unconditional) full system, thus leading to a better overall performance also in the case of no weak exogeneity. In particular, Johansen's sequential test selects r = r 0 = 1 only 45.5% (74%) of the time when T = 100 (T = 200), while the corresponding selection frequencies in partial systems for HJNR's sequential test are 69.3%, 62.1% and 57.9% (88.4%, 85.4% and 81.8%) in the case  of p Y = 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Furthermore, as in the case of weak exogeneity (Table 1), the empirical performance of HJNR's sequential test and HQC in partial systems are similar. As such, these two methods usefully complement each other in practice and are rather robust to violations of the hypothesis of weak exogeneity. 9 We consider a further case which, in addition to the violation of the weak exogeneity hypothesis, allows Z t to contain co-integrated variables. In particular, we add a further co-integration relation in model (7), ceteris paribus, by specifying := a 0 0 0 c c/2 c/ 3 \u2212a/ 2 0 0 0 \u22120.5 \u22120.3 0.25 and := 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 \u22121 , 9 It is also interesting to stress that the finite sample behaviour of BIC is the one which is more sensitive to the extent of the violation from weak exogeneity: The larger the value of c in in equation 7, the worse its performance for small T . However, as expected from a theoretical viewpoint and in line with the results in where, as in the previous case of Scenario B, we set a = \u22120.4 and c = 3 4 . In this case, we have that the last two variables in X t (and in Z t ) co-integrate among themselves, so that the true co-integration rank is r 0 = 2. The selection frequencies of r = 0,\u2026, p Y for BIC, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure in partial systems of dimension p Y = 2, 3 and 4 are reported in the left-panels of Table 3, whereas the results obtained from the (unconditional) full VAR analysis are reported in the right-panel of Table 3. Results in Table 3 show that, also in the case when Z t contains co-integrated variables, HQC and HJNR's sequential procedure provide satisfactory results in partial systems, especially when p Z is large, outperforming their analogues in the (unconditional) full system, even when the sample size is small. Conversely, when T = 100 and 200, BIC tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank and its performance in partial systems is worse than that obtained from the full system analysis.",

(2010) and CDRT. 10 When the actual unconditional probability distribution of \" t in system (1) is non-Gaussian, it is still in principle possible to factorize the density of X t as the product of the conditional density for Y t given Z t and the marginal density for Z t . However, the dynamic structure of the conditional system might not necessarily conform to that in equation 2and the parametric restrictions under which Z t is weakly exogenous for might become more involved. It turns out that checking the robustness of the HQC and BIC to conditional heteroscedasticity in partial systems is crucial for applied work. We perform such robustness check by considering the same DGP as in Table 2 but specifying the innovation process \" t in equation 7as a CCC-GARCH (Bollerslev, 1990) process, i.e., 10 Cavaliere et al. (2010) show that the extension to conditional heteroscedasticity is allowed as long as that the innovations {\" t } in equation (1) (i) form a martingale difference sequence with respect to the filtration F t := (X t ,\u2026, X t\u22121 ), where F t\u22121 \u2286 F t for t =\u2026, \u2212 1, 0, 1, 2,\u2026, (ii) satisfy the condition E \" t 4 K < \u221e, \u2022 being the Euclidean norm, and (iii) fulfil the global homoscedasticity condition:   where H t = E(\" t \" t |F t\u22121 ) is the conditional variance of \" t , F t := (X t ,\u2026, X t\u22121 ) is the filtration at time t and R is a symmetric positive definite matrix containing the constant conditional correlations ij . 11 Results are reported in Table 4. By comparing selection frequencies in Table 4 with those in Table 2, we observe that the CCC-GARCH(1,1) disturbances have only a limited impact on the finite sample ability of information criteria (as well as HJNR's sequential procedure) to correctly select co-integration rank. This evidence confirms, as expected, the results already documented by Cavaliere et al. (2010) and CDRT in the full system framework. In summary, the results of our Monte Carlo simulations in scenarios A and B show that the benefits of combining information criteria with partial system analyses can be substantial and usefully complement HJNR's sequential test approach in practice. More- 11 Data are generated by using the same specification of , and 1 as in Table 2. As concerns the CCC-GARCH part, we draw the coefficients ij (i = j) from independent uniform distributions with support (\u22121, 1) and set the GARCH parameters in equation 8    ",

Doornik et al. (1998), B\u00e5rdsen, Jansen and Nymoen (2003) and Bruggeman et al. (2003) are some of the few examples where HJNR's testing procedure is implemented. As already observed, two main difficulties characterize the use of HJNR's sequential test in applied work. First, it is generally difficult to select a priori the vector Z t of weakly exogenous conditioning variables. Second, testing weak exogeneity of Z t efficiently requires either a full-system approach or the analysis of the marginal model for Z t , see e.g. Urbain (1992), Boswijk (1995), Ericsson (1995) and Boswijk and Urbain (1997). In both cases the benefits of the partial system analysis are nullified. In the previous sections, we have shown that we can use BIC and/or HQC to determine co-integration rank in the conditional model Y t given Z t in equation 2, without being concerned about the weak exogeneity of Z t . Moreover, the Monte Carlo results show that the finite sample performance of BIC and HQC in the conditional model Y t given Z t is generally not worse than the empirical performance of the BIC and HQC in the full system for X t := (Y t , Z t ) regardless of whether VAR disturbances are Gaussian or driven by GARCH-type components. In this section, we illustrate the advantages of our approach by two empirical examples, both based on the estimation of VAR models on US quarterly data.",

The idea in this case is to show that, other than reducing the dimensionality of the system, the partial system approach combined with the use of information criteria can be useful for co-integration rank determination. In particular, it is argued that in the absence of clear theoretical guidances about the number of stochastic trends in X t := (Y t , Z t ), one useful empirical specification strategy is to start the analysis by including in Z t time series that are not supposed to co-integrate. Indeed, although Z t can be co-integrated in our approach (see Remark 3 and the Monte Carlo results in Table 3), in large systems it can be relatively easier to make conjectures on which time series should not co-integrate rather than on the variables which should be weakly exogenous. Given different choices of the candidate Z t vector, the empirical illustration shows that our empirical specification strategy, combined with BIC and HQC, simplifies co-integration rank determination.",

More specifically, the DSGE model we consider features the natural rate of output, which is a variable that captures a highly theoretical concept, difficult to characterize in applied work.

The macroeconomic literature has recently documented a dramatic fall in the variances of the main macroeconomic time series, which has been termed 'Great Moderation'. Kim and Nelson (1999) and Stock and Watson (2002) offer support for a break in the macroeconomic volatilities around 1984. McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000) identify 1984Q1 as the breakdate of the variance of the US real GDP. Boivin and Giannoni (2006) also detect a break in the coefficients of a reduced-form VAR for the US economy in the early 1980s. In line with this literature, we identify the beginning and the end of the 'Great Moderation' sample with the dates 1984Q1 and 2008Q2, respectively, for a total of T + k = 98 quarterly observations, where k is the VAR lag order for X t := (cnd t , cd t , i t , y t , inf t , f t , R t ) . The end of the sample, 2008Q2, is justified by our decision to avoid dealing with the acceleration of the financial crisis and, above all, with the binding zero-lower bound (ZLB) that has kicked in since the end of 2008. Figure 1 plots the 'great ratios' cnd t \u2212 y t , cd t \u2212 y t and i t \u2212 y t , the (ex post) real interest rate, R t \u2212 inf t , the interest rate differential, R t \u2212 f t , and the (ex post) real version of the policy rate, f t \u2212 inf t , on the period 1984Q1-2008Q2. According to neoclassical theory, under balanced growth there should be a common stochastic trend driving cnd t , cd t , i t and y t , and the 'great ratios'cnd t \u2212 y t , cd t \u2212 y t and i t \u2212 y t should be stationary (King et al., 1991). Also the interest rates R t , f t and the inflation rate inf t should be driven by a single (common) stochastic trend while the (ex post) real interest rates and the interest rate differential should be stationary.

For instance, the results for the full system analysis reported in Table 2 (Scenario B) suggest that for small values of r 0 relative to p and in samples of length T = 100, HQC and Johansen's test tend to select co-integration rank larger than the true one, while BIC tends to select the true co-integration rank more accurately. On the other hand, HQC and HJNR's procedure improve considerably their selection performance in the partial system approach and become more powerful than BIC, which in turn tends to underestimate the true co-integration rank.

The structural model features the following equations:x VAR framework. Indeed (see also the previous example), the natural rate of output is a variable which captures a highly theoretical concept: it refers to the highest level of real output that can be sustained over the long term and there is some disagreement among economists about how to characterize such a concept in applied work. In many empirical business cycle models, x n t is treated as an unobserved (latent) state variable, while in empirical applications, x n t is often proxied with measures of economic activity provided by official institutions or national statistical institutes. Thus, albeit in this example the dimension of X t is not particularly large, x n t represents a 'natural' conditioning variable for the purpose of testing the co-integration implications of the DSGE model. In addition, the practitioner might not be interested in modelling x n t directly within the VAR framework due to poor confidence on the short run properties of the time series used to proxy x n t . Hence, it seems reasonable to investigate whether the data support the co-integration/common trend implications predicted by the DSGE model by considering the partition X t = (Y t , Z t ), with Y t = (x t , t , i t ) (p Y = 3) and Z t = x n t (p Z = 1), and then apply BIC and HQC to the conditional model for Y t given Z t . For comparative purposes, we also compute the sequential cointegration rank testing procedure of HJNR which requires Z t to be weakly exogenous with respect to\u02dc matrix in equation 14, namely that = 0 in equation 13. As in the previous example, in order to show the usefulness of the partial system approach relative to the (unconditional) full system analysis, we also determine the co-integration rank of X t through the full VAR system approach.",

The data source is the web site of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Also in this case the data cover the 'Great Moderation' period. To compare results with B\u00e5rdsen and Fanelli (2015), we focus on the sample 1985Q1-2008Q3 which comprises T = 95 quarterly observations. The partial (conditional) system (2) is estimated with k = 2 lags and a restricted constant (corresponding to case (ii) D t = 1 and d t = 0 in the full system (1)). Results are reported in the left-panel of Table 6, which summarizes the co-integration rank selected by the BIC and HQC, as well as HJNR's sequential procedure. While BIC selects co-integration rank r = 1, HQC selects r = 3 as predicted by the DSGE model. Instead, HJNR's sequential procedure selects r = 2 at the 5% nominal significance level. Recall, however, that the asymptotic critical values reported in Table 6 have been tabulated under the maintained hypothesis of weak exogeneity of Z t = (x n t ) which might not hold (see below). The right panel of Table 6 summarizes the results obtained from the full VAR system analysis and reports the co-integration rank selected by BIC and HQC and Johansen's sequential procedure. We notice that in this case BIC selects r = 1, HQC selects r = 2 and Johansen's sequential procedure selects r = 1 at the 5% nominal significance level.

The 5% c.v. for HJNR's test are taken from table 3 of Harbo et al. (1998) and the 5% c.v. for Johansen's test ('Johan') are taken from table 15.2 of Johansen (1996) (restricted constant). The selected co-integration rank according to the test/criterion used are denoted in bold. The co-integration rank predicted by the theory under the null of the DSGE model is r = r 0 = 3. of the p \u00d7 3 matrix is zero in the full system for a given (exactly) identified specification of the p \u00d7 3 matrix . The likelihood-ratio test for the three zero restrictions in the matrix is equal to 35.2 and when compared with asymptotic critical values taken from its null 2 -distribution with 3 degree of freedom leads to a firm rejection of the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity. This evidence suggests that, although our Monte Carlo results show that HJNR's sequential procedure tends to perform reasonably well in small samples also when Z t is not weakly exogenous, it must be interpreted with caution in applied work. Conversely, our approach based on information criteria, allows us to disregard any consideration about the weak exogeneity of Z t and therefore is robust to whether the parameter is = 0 or < 0 in the structural equations of our DSGE model. We complete our investigation of the small scale DSGE model by comparing results with B\u00e5rdsen and Fanelli (2015). The analysis in B\u00e5rdsen and Fanelli (2015), based on a full system approach, suggests that if the co-integration rank is fixed at r = 3, a likelihoodratio test for the restrictions that =\u02dc as in equation 14leads to a p-value of 0.009 when asymptotic critical values are used, and to a p-value of 0.04 when a non-parametric bootstrap version of the likelihood-ratio test is computed along the lines of Boswijk et al. (2016). Overall, we can interpret these evidences as supportive of the small-DSGE model (9)-(13) on the period 1985Q1-2008Q3.",

There are cases where it is convenient to devote attention to the model that characterizes the dynamics of the variables of interest, conditional on some other variables whose dynamic characterization is not of primary interest. This approach is useful either in large systems or when the practitioner benefits from marginalizing out variables which contribute to the long-run equilibrium but do not play a key role in the rest of the analysis. In this paper we have extended the use of information criteria for cointegration rank determination to the case of partial systems. We have proved consistency of BIC and HQC in partial systems and shown the robustness of these criteria to violations of the weak exogeneity of the conditioning variables for the co-integration parameters. A set of Monte Carlo experiments and two empirical illustrations have shown that these criteria represent valid alternatives to the 'traditional' approaches to co-integration rank determination.",

In particular, if the conditioning variables are not weakly exogenous for the long-run parameters, the maximum likelihood estimator of the co-integration parameters is still super-consistent (albeit not fully efficient) but its asymptotic distribution is not mixed-Gaussian, making the construction of tests cumbersome; see also Phillips (1991Phillips ( , 1994. In this paper we have shown that the benefits of marginalizing Z t out may compensate, in some specific problems and cases of interest, possible losses of efficiency of estimates and the problem of dealing with non-standard inference. As the examples in the empirical section of this paper show, our approach is particularly convenient when the primary concern of the investigator is co-integration rank determination. Obviously, the decision of whether it is preferable to rely on a full or partial system approach for the problem under investigation depends on the specific purposes of the analysis. ",

In particular, the fluctuations of cnd t \u2212 y t around a possible linear trend and of i t \u2212 y t around a constant level do not line up with the typical persistence of stationary, mean-reverting processes. Moreover, only the interest rate differential, R t \u2212 f t , appears to be stationary (although highly persistent) around a constant level, while the (ex post) real interest rates R t \u2212 inf t and f t \u2212 inf t display some trending behaviour (which can partially be explained in terms of the 'aggressive' monetary policy undertaken by the Fed to fight inflation since the end of the seventies). All this evidence is consistent with the view that it was the change in conduct of monetary policy undertaken by the Fed at the end of the seventies/beginning of the eighties that 'stabilized' the US economy through an aggressive behaviour against inflation. In line with the 'Great Moderation' explanation of the US business cycle (Clarida, Gal\u00ec and Gertler, 2000), one can hardly claim that there are only two common stochastic trends (i.e. five co-integrating relations) driving the variables in X t . Rather, it would seem reasonable to expect the presence of not more than three co-integrating relationships in the 1984Q1-2008Q2 period, corresponding to the existence of at least four common stochastic trends in X t . Given our purposes, we prefer not to take any stand about the possible additional co-integration relation other than cd t \u2212 y t and R t \u2212 f t .",

The model with restricted linear trend allows for trendstationary co-integration relationships, which can be an interesting case given the time series patterns observed in Figure 1. Notice that the full system analysis is carried out for comparative purposes only, namely to check whether we obtain significant differences in the co-integration rank determination with respect to the partial system approach.

In this case, we have included in Z t as initial step of the analysis a set of conditioning variables (the fixed-private investments and the inflation rate) which are expected to be I(1) but not co-integrated. Albeit Z t can potentially be co-integrated in our setup (see Remark 3 and Table 3), our suggestion is that it may be convenient to start the analysis with this choice because it is often easier to make conjectures on which variables are likely to be no co-integrated, rather than on which variables should not adjust to the long run equilibria. Modelling Y t conditional on Z t requires considering a five-dimensional system as in equation (2) and, notably, we can apply BIC and HQC ignoring the weak exogeneity condition of Z t . Results are reported in the middle panel of Table 5, which also reports, for completeness, the outcome of HJNR's sequential procedure. Although the asymptotic critical values associated with HJNR's test are computed under the assumption of weak exogeneity of Z t , the Monte Carlo evidence summarized in Tables 1-4 has shown that HJNR's test performs reasonably well in samples of length T = 100 irrespective of whether Z t is weakly exogenous or not (or co-integrated or",
