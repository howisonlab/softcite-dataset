Objective: We sought to convert these text entries into a more useful form, for research and QA purposes, upon entry into a data warehouse. Methods: We derived a series of rules and assigned quality scores to the transformed values, conforming to physiologic parameters for vital signs across the age range and spectrum of illness seen in the emergency department. Results: Validating these entries revealed that 98% of free-text data had perfect quality scores, conforming to established vital sign parameters. Average vital signs varied as expected by age. Degradations in quality scores were most commonly attributed logging temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius; vital signs with this error could still be transformed for use. Errors occurred more frequently during periods of high triage, though error rates did not correlate with triage volume. Conclusions: In developing a method for importing free-text vital sign data from our emergency department information system, we now have a data warehouse with a broad array of quality-checked vital signs, permitting analysis and correlation with demographics and outcomes."

The fewest low-quality vitals (106 total) were recorded between 5-6am, which is associated with both the lowest intake and lowest occupancy in the department. The rate of error per patient triaged at this early morning hour, however, was approximately equal to (in fact, slightly higher than) the 9-10pm error rate per patient triaged (0.190 vs 0.178), despite a much lower influx of patients and a much lower patient census.",
