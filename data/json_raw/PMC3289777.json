            "text": "Background: The identification of molds in clinical laboratories is largely on the basis of phenotypic criteria, the classification of which can be subjective. Recently, molecular methods have been introduced for identification of pathogenic molds in clinical settings. Here, we employed comparative sequence analysis to identify molds. Methods: A total of 47 clinical mold isolates were used in this study, including Aspergillus and Trichophyton. All isolates were identified by phenotypic properties, such as growth rate, colony morphology, and reproductive structures. PCR and direct sequencing, targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit, and the \u00df-tubulin gene, were performed using primers described previously. Comparative sequence analysis by using the GenBank database was performed with the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) algorithm. Results: For Aspergillus, 56% and 67% of the isolates were identified to the species level by using ITS and \u00df-tubulin analysis, respectively. Only D1/D2 analysis was useful for Trichophyton identification, with 100% of isolates being identified to the species level. Performances of ITS and D1/D2 analyses were comparable for species-level identification of molds other than Aspergillus and Trichophyton. In contrast, the efficacy of \u00df-tubulin analysis was limited to genus identification because of the paucity of database information for this gene. Conclusions: The molecular methods employed in this study were valuable for mold identification, although the different loci used had variable usefulness, according to mold genus. Thus, a tailored approach is recommended when selecting amplification targets for molecular identification of molds."

Mold infections are more frequently encountered in association with increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients, and molds other than Aspergillus fumigatus, including species not previously recognized as pathogens, have emerged [1,2]. The appearance of organisms, such as the Fusarium species and the Zygomycetes, with variable sus-ceptibilities to conventional antifungal agents underscores the importance of correct identification [3].",

However, the ITS region might not provide species-level resolution for all species. In such cases, other targets such as the D1/D2 region of the 28S subunit, the \u00df-tubulin gene, or the translation elongation factor gene may prove useful, depending on the genus in question. In this study, we used molecular methods for mold identification and compared the performances of the ITS region, the D1/D2 region, and the \u00df-tubulin gene as amplification targets for comparative sequence analysis.",

Using this method, 2 genera previously unidentified in a clinical laboratory were discovered, Coniosporium and Geosmithia. The Coniosporium species isolate was a slow-growing, black pigmented fungus recovered from a toenail, and showed arthroconidia microscopically. Coniosporium, which is known to colonize plants, has been reported in the literature as a human pathogen recovered from a superficial skin lesion [10]. The isolates identified as G. argillacea grew as whitish to olive colonies and had phialides, which were difficult to distinguish from those of Penicillium or Paecilomyces. Geosmithia is a polyphyletic genus created to accommodate Penicil-lium species that do not produce green colonies. According to recent reports [11,12], G. argillacea can colonize the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, although it was not found to be associated with exacerbation of the disease. One of our isolates was obtained from the trans-tracheal aspirate of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient with influenza H1N1 infection, and the other isolate was obtained from the lung tissue of a patient with chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis. Additional research is required to determine the clinical implications of colonization with G. argillacea.",

In contrast to D1/D2 analysis, where all species yielded 100% identical sequence data for at least one molecular sibling (closely related but different taxa), the ITS analysis distinguished some of the species (A. fumigates, A. terreus) from their molecular siblings. The \u00df-tubulin gene was also helpful for some species (A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A. sydowii). In contrast, D1/D2 analysis was more appropriate than that of ITS for identifying Trichophyton species. Interestingly, isolates morphologically identified as T. mentagrophytes were re-classified into T. interdigitale (Arthroderma vanbreuseghemii) after analysis of the D1/D2 region, according to the current taxonomy suggested by Graser et al. [14]. The sequence of these isolates was identical to the neotype of T. interdigitale, CBS 428.63 (AF506033), but not with the neotype of T. mentagrophytes, CBS 318.56 (AY185126). Although the naming of the T. mentagrophytes complex has been a topic of debate for years, use of T. mentagrophytes rather than T. interdigitale could result in confusion, an issue recently raised in the literature [15,16].
