            "text": "Background: Golgi is a potential target for cancer treatment, but no inhibitor became an anticancer drug. Results: Using a unique bioinformatics approach, we identified a novel Golgi inhibitor, AMF-26, targeting Arf1 activation and possessing potent antitumor activity. Conclusion: AMF-26 is a promising new anticancer drug lead. Significance: Our data indicate that Arf1 activation is a promising target for cancer treatment. ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) plays a major role in mediating vesicular transport. Brefeldin A (BFA), a known inhibitor of the Arf1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) interaction, is highly cytotoxic. Therefore, interaction of Arf1 with ArfGEF is an attractive target for cancer treatment. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the pre-clinical stage of drug development because of their poor bioavailability. Here, we aimed to identify novel inhibitors of the Arf1-ArfGEF interaction that display potent antitumor activity in vivo but with a chemical structure distinct from that of BFA. We exploited a panel of 39 cell lines (termed JFCR39) coupled with a drug sensitivity data base and COMPARE algorithm, resulting in the identification of a possible novel Arf1-ArfGEF inhibitor AMF-26, which differed structurally from BFA. By using a pulldown assay with GGA3-conjugated beads, we demonstrated that AMF-26 inhibited Arf1 activation. Subsequently, AMF-26 induced Golgi disruption, apoptosis, and cell growth inhibition. Computer modeling/molecular dynamics (MD) simulation suggested that AMF-26 bound to the contact surface of the Arf1-Sec7 domain where BFA bound. AMF-26 affected membrane traffic, including the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi networks, and the endosomal systems. Furthermore, using AMF-26 and its derivatives, we demonstrated that there was a significant correlation between cell growth inhibition and Golgi disruption. In addition, orally administrated AMF-26 (83 mg/kg of body weight; 5 days) induced complete regression of human breast cancer BSY-1 xenografts in vivo, suggesting that AMF-26 is a novel anticancer drug candidate that inhibits the Golgi system, targeting Arf1 activation.",

Therefore, inhibitors of specific PPIs can act as novel therapeutic agents including anticancer drugs. Indeed, several small molecule-PPI inhibitors have been developed, such as Nutlin-3 for HDM2-p53 interaction (3), and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor (4).

            "text": "In this study, we focused on the activation of ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) by its guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Arfs are members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases that play a major role in mediating vesicular transport in the secretory and endocytic pathways (5). The cellular activity of Arfs is stimulated by the Sec7 domain of GEFs that promote the exchange of inactive GDP-bound forms to active GTP-bound forms (6). Arf1, the best characterized Arf, localizes primarily to the Golgi apparatus and regulates both anterograde and retrograde vesicular traffic (7). The first identified small molecule PPI that targets the interaction between Arf-ArfGEF was brefeldin A (BFA, Fig. 1A), a lactone isolated from fungi, which inhibits the activation of Arf1 by a subset of its GEFs (8,9). Treatment of BFA causes rapid but reversible disruption of the Golgi apparatus leading to the vesiculation of the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi network (TGN) (10,11). Furthermore, BFA showed tumor growth inhibition in vitro (12) and in vivo at an early stage (13). Therefore, inhibitors of Arf1-ArfGEF interaction are valuable tools for studying membrane traffic as well as anticancer drug candidates. However, BFA and its deriv-ously (23). HEK293T (human embryonic kidney) cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Ten molecular dynamic (MD) calculations were simultaneously performed using different initial structures. Each of the MD calculations was carried out for 1 ns with an integral time step of 1 fs. The lengths of the covalent bonds were fixed. The temperature of the system was maintained at 1,200 K to enhance the sampling efficiency. Conformers were sampled every 100 steps, and then each conformer was minimized until the root mean square of the gradients of the potential energy was below 0.001 kcal mol \u03ea1 \u00c5 \u03ea1 . All conformations were clustered with torsion angles of heavy atoms using a threshold of \u03ee30\u00b0. The Merck Molecular Force Field 94s was used to evaluate the potential energy surface of the molecule (28,29). The dielectric constant was 80, but no cut-off distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Because of the low probability of the existence of conformers with higher energies, the conformers within 15 kcal mol \u03ea1 of the minimum energy of the molecule were adopted for superposition.",

This superposes two molecules based on the physicochemical properties of the atomic groups, which is useful for estimating the binding conformation of a molecule by distinguishing it from the many conformations that are generated by CAMDAS. The program considers five types of physicochemical property: hydrophobic (HP), aromatic (AR), hydrogen-bond donors (HD), hydrogenbond acceptors (HA), and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (DA). Each type is represented as a sphere with a predefined radius (1.0 or 0.5 \u00c5) and is assigned to a functional group in a molecule (Fig. 4, A and B). After molecular superposition, the matching spheres were scored using the scoring matrix (supplemental Table S1). One AMF-26 conformation was chosen as the binding conformation based on the scores and the overlapped molecular volumes (Fig. 4C) To relieve the steric hindrances, the coordinates of AMF-26 and of the residues within 4 \u00c5 from AMF-26 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol \u03ea1 \u00c5 \u03ea1 using SYBYL. The simplex minimization method before the conjugate-gradient minimization procedure was used. The Tripos force field was employed for the molecular energy calculation. The AMBER 4.1 charges (31) were used as the atomic charges for the proteins and the Gasteiger-H\u00fcckel charges (32)(33)(34)(35) were used as the charges for AMF-26. The cut-off distance for the non-bonded interactions was 8 \u00c5. The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was used. The initial positions of the missing atoms in the crystal structure were generated by the SYBYL.",

            "text": "Disassembly of the Golgi Apparatus Caused by AMF-26-COMPARE analysis indicated that AMF-26, like BFA, may be a Golgi disruptor. Therefore, we first examined whether AMF-26 induces Golgi disassembly by immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody to Golgi brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1). GBF1 is localized to the cis-Golgi apparatus and plays a role in vesicular trafficking by activating Arf1 (48). In control cells, GBF1 was observed in the perinuclear region, forming a ribbon-like structure ( Fig.  2A). However, addition of BFA caused a rapid release of GBF1 into the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). These results were in agreement with previously published reports (48). When the cells were treated with AMF-26, GBF1 was observed to be dispersed from the perinuclear region throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C), which indicated that AMF-26 disrupted the Golgi apparatus. Moreover, this observation was confirmed by live imaging using the MDA-MB-435 stably expressing GFP-conjugated clathrin light chain a (CLCa) cells (supplemental Video S1, A-C). In MDA-MB-435/GFP-CLCa cells, the intensity of fluorescence signals of GFP-CLCa were periodically increased and decreased at the TGN, suggesting that the formation of clathrin-coated pits occurs synchronously and periodically at the TGN (23). Disruption of the Golgi apparatus was concurrent with the disappearance of GFP-CLCa signals suggesting that CLCa was affected by AMF-26. Next, we examined whether the  The normal Golgi structure reappeared in the perinuclear area 4 h after washout of drugs with drug-free medium (Fig. 2D), which indicated that the effect of AMF-26 against Golgi was fully reversible like that of BFA (49).",

            "text": "Correlation between Cell Growth Inhibition and Golgi Disruption-It is still uncertain whether the growth-inhibitory activity of BFA is related to its effects on Golgi disruption (56,57). We examined the correlation between cell growth inhibition and Golgi disruption activity to investigate the causal relationship of these two events. Specifically, we examined the activities of AMF-26 and its five derivatives AMF-14, AMF-35, AMF-46, AMF-48, and AMF-59 (structural formula of each compound shown in Fig. 6A). In BSY-1 cells, AMF-26 exhibited the strongest activity of cell growth inhibition with a GI 50 of 12 nM and that of Golgi disruption with an EC 50 of 27 nM. AMF-35 displayed the weakest activities with a GI 50 and EC 50 of 14 and 4.9 M, respectively, (Fig. 6, B and C). We next investigated whether the Golgi disruption activities (the logarithm of EC 50 ) of these six compounds were related to their growth inhibitory activities (the logarithm of GI 50 ). Our analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation (r \u03ed 0.92 and p \u03ed 0.009) between these two activities (Fig. 6D). A statistically significant correlation between the logarithm of EC 50 and the logarithm of GI 50 was also observed when six other cell lines were treated with AMF-26 (r \u03ed 0.93 and p \u03ed 0.02, Fig. 6E). Taken together, our results suggested that there was a causal relationship between the Golgi disruption and cell growth inhibition.",

Administration of AMF-26 at 83 or 100 mg/kg induced almost complete tumor regression on day 21 (Fig. 7C, upper  panel). To assess toxicity, we measured the body weight of the tumor-bearing mice. The weight of the tumor-bearing mice was slightly reduced by administration of AMF-26. After termination of the administration, the weight was rapidly regained but was not fully recovered during the observation (Fig. 7C,  lower panel).

            "text": "The Arf family of small GTPases plays a major role in maintaining Golgi structure and driving Golgi membrane traffic (5,7). It is known that the BFA-sensitive large ArfGEFs, such as GBF1, BIG1, and BIG2, are predominantly localized to the cis-Golgi and TGN. After activation by GBF1, Arf1 mediates COPI   (48). On the other hand, when activated by BIG1 or BIG2, Arf1 recruits adapter proteins, AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4 (58), and Golgi-associated \u2425-adaptin ear-containing Arfbinding proteins, GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 (59). These Arf1effector molecules mediate transport between TGN and endosomes (58). BFA inactivates Arf1 by inhibiting PPIs between Arf1 and Arf1GEFs, and subsequently induces the disruption of cis-Golgi and TGN, or affects the endosomal systems (10,11). Furthermore, BFA showed tumor growth inhibition in vitro (12) and in vivo at an early stage (13). From the viewpoint of developing molecular-targeted drugs, BFA is attractive because its target, Arf1 and ArfGEF interaction, is unique. However, BFA and its derivatives have not progressed beyond the preclinical stage of drug development (13,14).",

In this study, we exploited the COMPARE analysis to screen BFA-like small molecule inhibitors. Using this approach, we identified AMF-26 as a novel inhibitor of Arf1 activation, despite the fact that its chemical structure does not resemble that of BFA. From these results, the screening of chemicals guided by COMPARE analysis appears to be useful for the discovery of novel drug candidates targeting various biological functions including the Golgi system.",
