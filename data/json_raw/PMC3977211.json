Methods: Two data sets were used in this research. The first one was a multistage random sample of 2397 healthy school children in pre-pubertal stage in Shiraz. The second data set consisted of 487 healthy students in pubertal stage and 558 students in post-pubertal stage. The parametric LMS method was used to construct reference centiles curves for each measure. The Kappa statistic was applied to examine the pairwise agreement of the four indices for detecting thinness and obesity. Results: Generally, the pairwise agreement of adiposity measures was higher for identifying obesity than thinness. There was an excellent agreement between WH and BMI for detecting both thin and obese children in almost all subgroups (P<0.001). MUAC had an excellent agreement with BMI in prepubertal individuals (P<0.001). However, TST had a weak agreement with the other three indices for detecting thinness and weak to good agreement for classification of obesity. Conclusion: The performance of the four anthropometric-based measurements varied by sex and maturity level. MUAC as a simple and low-cost screening tool can also be used as an alternative to BMI for obesity assessment among pre-pubertal groups.",

            "text": "he worldwide growing pattern of childhood obesity has been identified as an important health problem over the past decades [1][2][3][4][5] . Obesity during childhood has been established to be strongly associated with that in adulthood and also with several chronic diseases such as diabetes, some types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases [1][2][3][4][5][6] . In addition, being underweight is an index of malnutrition and is also recognized as an underlying cause of some health disorders [7][8] . Therefore, proper assessment of the body composition is a critical concern in public health evaluation and clinical screening. The reference methods such as dual-energy X-ray (DXA) or underwater weighting, which can analyze body composition accurately, are limited to the clinical research due to their complexity and cost [9][10][11] . Instead, a variety of anthropometric-based measurements such as body mass index (BMI), weight-for-height (WH), triceps skinfold thickness (TST) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were introduced as simple, low cost and feasible methods [9][10][11] . Previous studies showed that different indices estimate different values T for the prevalence of underweightness or overweightness which may lead to unnecessary and inappropriate clinical intervention [12] . Therefore, selecting the most appropriate and feasible method among a variety of existing obesity indices is an important key to a successful clinical decision. The performance of the aforementioned anthropometric measurements has been evaluated by pioneer researchers, demonstrating that each method has its own advantages and disadvantages and behaves differently in different age and sex groups [6,[9][10][11]13] . However, a critical point which has not been comprehensively addressed is whether these body composition indices among various sex and maturation stage groups classify the same subjects as obese or thin which can be explored by agreement analysis. Although few studies have assessed the degree of pairwise agreement between a number of body composition indices in various age groups [10,12,[14][15][16] , to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the agreement of the all four obesity indices including BMI, WH, TST and MUAC simultaneously. Furthermore, most of the previously published studies have focused on just children or adolescents separately or have assessed children in a wide range of age altogether.",

Determination of sample size was conducted in a similar procedure as the former study described above. Two guidance schools and two high schools were selected randomly and in each grade of the schools a random sample of the students were selected. In this study, weight, height, MUAC, and age were measured using the same techniques and devices as the former one by two trained auxologists, except TST which was measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. In this study, no exact criteria were used to classify participants in pubertal and post-pubertal categories. However, based on the mean and median age of girls and boys in different pubertal stages reported in the studies performed previously in Iran [19][20] , we categorized students in guidance school to pubertal stage and those in high school to post-pubertal stage. The subjects' body mass index was obtained as weight divided by squared height in metric system (kg/m 2 ). The LMS method [21] was applied to calculate sexspecific weight-for-height, BMI-for-age, MUAC-forage, and also TST-for-age centiles in each of the three stages of maturity. The growth reference centile charts for prepubertal children were provided in the previous studies [22][23][24][25] . Although there is still no comprehensive consensus on how to define underweight and overweightness based on growth reference centiles, in this study the 5 th and 95 th centiles (according to a number of references [22,[26][27] were selected as cut-off points to identify underweight and obese children, respectively. Kappa statistic was used to assess the pairwise agreement of the WH, BMI, MUAC and TST for classifying underweight and obese children. A value of zero indicates no concordance and a value of unity indicates perfect concordance. Kappa coefficient greater than 0.75 represents excellent agreement, between 0.40 and 0.75 fair to good agreement, and smaller than 0.40 poor agreement [28] . In addition, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the linear association of anthropometric measures. Data analysis was performed using LMSchartmaker and SPSS 11.5 softwares.   which the boys had a significantly greater BMI as compared to the girls. In addition, in younger children (less than 11.5 years), there was no significant difference between the two genders regarding their weight and height, though in older ones the weight and height of the boys was significantly higher than those of the girls. In terms of MUAC, just in the middle-aged children as well as the last age group significant differences were observed between boys and girls in which boys' MUAC was greater than that of girls. However, the girls' TST was thicker than that of the boys (p-value<0.05) in the age groups of 9.5 to 14.49 and 16.5-17.49 years, reflecting a reverse pattern between boys and girls compared to the other indices. The pubertal stage and sex-specific prevalence of thinness and obesity based on the four aforementioned growth reference centiles are presented in Table 2. Generally, obesity was more prevalent than thinness.",

As shown in Table 4, the level of agreement between WH and BMI was excellent for assessing thinness in both sexes and each pubertal stage except for the pubertal girls and post-pubertal boys, revealing a good agreement. Moreover, the level of agreement between MUAC and BMI was moderate in all classifications with the exception of the pubertal girls which was poor. MUAC and WH had moderate agreement in the post-pubertal girls and boys and poor agreement in the others levels of maturity.

Furthermore, an excellent agreement between MUAC and BMI in the prepubertal stage and a moderate one in the other maturity   levels was observed. In addition, the level of agreement between MUAC and WH was reasonably good. Finally, TST had moderate agreement with the other three measurements in almost all cases, but in the pubertal girls and the post-pubertal boys had poor agreement. Table 6 shows bivariate correlations between anthropometric measurements classified by sex and maturity level. Height is not as highly correlated with the other indices as weight. Its correlation coefficient declined with the increase of maturity stage and it reached its minimum value in the post-pubertal group. The correlation coefficient between weight and the other indices decreased with increase of maturity level and its correlation was weaker with TST as compared with the other measurements. The highest correlation between weight and BMI was observed in postpubertal stage (0.93 for both genders). In addition, the correlation of BMI with MUAC was greater than with TST. The correlation of TST also reduced when the stage of puberty increased with the smallest values in the post-pubertal boys.",

However, generally the prevalence of obesity was higher than that of thinness in almost all sex and pubertal stage groups; this might be due to the socioeconomic improvement as well as modernization process which occurred in Iran in the past decades [25] . Nevertheless, based on the BMI, MUAC, and WH the prevalence of thinness is higher than that of obesity among post-pubertal girls. One possible reason is that in this stage girls are more likely to perceive themselves as overweight than boys, so they are likely to be engaged in weight control practice and lose their weight [29] .",

However, another study made a conclusion that BMI, TST, and MUAC have reasonable success for detecting obesity among children and adolescents [6] .",

Previous research revealed high correlation between BMI and Body Fat Mass (BFM) as an accurate index for assessing body fat among Iranian college students [41] . However, further research is needed on Iranian children and adolescents to determine the most reliable and valid index representing accurate assessment of thinness and obesity. Another limitation is that, no accurate criteria were applied for classification of participants in different stages of puberty; hence we recommended using more reliable and accurate methods than just considering the age of children for determination of puberty stage in future studies.",

Therefore, preventive measures for controlling obesity are a must for public health promotion among school children in Iran. Another important finding is that WH and BMI can be used interchangeably in different pubertal stages and for detecting both underweight and overweightness. In addition, in pre-pubertal stage BMI and MUAC can be used instead of each other for classifying obesity. Overall, our results are consistent with the pioneer research suggest that caution should be taken for selecting an appropriate index to classify children and adolescents as obese or thin in different sex and age groups. In addition, a single index may not produce satisfactory results and use of multiple indicators may lead to more trustworthy conclusions.",
