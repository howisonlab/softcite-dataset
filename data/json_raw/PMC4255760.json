We investigated the effects of incorporating v-3 fish oil in a parenteral nutrition mixture on signs of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease and explored the mechanism involved in this process. Methods: Seven-day-old New Zealand rabbits were divided into 3 groups of 8, and for 1 week they were infused via the right jugular vein with standard total parenteral nutrition with soybean oil (TPN-soy) or TPN with v-3 fish oil-based lipid emulsion (TPN-FO), or naturally nursed with rabbit milk (control). Serum and liver tissues were analyzed for serological indicators and pathology, respectively. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the messenger RNA levels of the endoplasmic reticulum stress chaperone protein glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) in liver tissues and GRP94 protein levels were compared through immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays. Results: TPN-soy animals had significantly higher serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and g-glutamyl transpeptidase and lower serum albumin than the controls (P < 0.01, each) or the TPN-FO group, which were similar to the controls (P < 0.01 cf. TPN). Damage to liver tissues of the TPN-FO group was much less than that of the TPN-soy group. GRP94 messenger RNA and protein levels in liver tissues of TPN-soy animals were significantly higher than that of the controls or TPN-FO rabbits, which were similar to the controls. Conclusions: Incorporating v-3 fish oil in parenteral nutrition emulsion greatly prevented liver dysfunction and liver tissue damage in week-old rabbit kits, possibly by preventing endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

It can be a lifesaving therapy for newborn patients. Since the first documented report of an infant given parenteral nutrition was published in 1944, >30,000 neonates have survived through its use (1). The treatment is, however, not without its inherent risks, among which parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) is a common complication. Approximately 30% to 60% of the infants who require long-term parenteral nutrition develop PNALD, with abnormalities of liver function and hepatic damage (2). The latter can lead to cholestasis, especially in premature infants, and may result in life-threatening liver cirrhosis (3). Although the pathogenesis of parenteral nutritionassociated cholestasis is not entirely understood, in severe cases bile duct regeneration, portal inflammation, and fibrosis are contributing factors (4).",

Recent evidence suggests that lipid emulsions that consist of soybean oil in parenteral nutrition mixtures may have an essential role in the onset of subsequent liver damage (1,5). On the contrary, fish oil is rich in v-3 PUFAs, and fish oil-based lipid emulsions may be hepatoprotective and prevent PNALD (5,6). Moreover, the v-3 PUFAs in fish oil are relatively safe and can be used in neonates (7) and preterm infants (8). Nevertheless, the mechanism associated with putative v-3 PUFA-mediated hepatoprotection is unclear.",

            "text": "PNALD is a serious complication of patients, especially infants, who require long-term parenteral nutrition therapy. Here, we sustained 7-day-old rabbit kits for 1 week with TPN containing either soybean oil or v-3 fish oil, to examine the role of v-3 fish oil in preventing parenteral nutrition-associated liver injury. The effects of both of these were compared with normally nursed controls with regard to signs of PNALD. We found that, compared with the control group, usual soybean oil parenteral nutrition was associated with significant liver dysfunction, as indicated by higher serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and g-GT levels and lower serum albumin. These effects were not observed in the TPN-FO group, which was similar to the control group. Moreover, histological examination of liver tissues revealed hepatic damage in the TPN-soy group not seen in the TPN-FO, including inflammatory cell infiltration, diffuse hepatic steatosis, and disrupted hepatic cord structure. These observations are consistent with previous reports (15). Rats given TPN were found to have higher levels of the ER stress marker protein CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), and also higher levels of molecules that are proapoptotic under ER stress, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK1/2), and p38 MAPK (16). This suggests that ER stress is induced by TPN therapy. GRP94 is also a marker for ER stress, and in the present study we detected higher levels of GRP94 mRNA and GRP94 protein in the liver tissues of the rabbits given TPN-soy. Therefore, ER stress may participate in TPN-mediated liver damage in both rats and rabbits. Furthermore, it was reported that in normal liver L02 cells cultured in vitro, ER stress contributed to the progression of PNALD (17). In that report, ERS was induced with palmitate, which led to the upregulation of tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), a pseudokinase that is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of PNALD. Therefore, the ER stress seems be an important contributing factor in the pathogenesis and progression of PNALD.",

            "text": "Although the etiology of PNALD is poorly understood, the soybean or combined soybean and safflower oils that are included in TPN are accepted as contributing factors (18). Both of these oils are rich in v-6 fatty acids. It has been reported that v-6 PUFAs generate proinflammatory mediators, which may contribute to the onset of liver diseases, whereas mediators derived from v-3 PUFAs are largely anti-inflammatory (19). A randomized controlled trial conducted by Puder et al (20) showed that fish oil-based intravenous lipid emulsion was safe for infants with PNALD, and could reduce mortality and organ transplantation rates in children with short bowel syndrome. Consistent with their observations, Diamond et al (21) reported that v-3 fatty acids may prevent PNALD by improving bile flow, inhibiting steatosis, and exerting immunomodulatory  effects, although the molecular mechanism involved in this process remains unclear. In the present study, we found that substitution of v-3 fish oil for soybean fat emulsion was associated with prevention of liver dysfunction indicated by serology results, and liver tissue damage observed through histology. This implies that v-3 fish oil may protect against PNALD. Moreover, levels of GRP94 mRNA and GRP94 protein in the kits given TPN with v-3 fish oil were comparable with the control rabbits, and significantly lower than those given TPN with soybean fat emulsion. These data indicate that TPN-induced liver injury was reduced in those given v-3 fish oil, unlike those given soybean fat emulsion, and its mechanism may be associated with a reduction in ER stress by reducing the GRP94 expression associated with soybean fat emulsion. Our findings are consistent with a previous report that glycyrrhizin, an active component of licorice root that has been used to treat chronic hepatitis, represses TPN-associated acute liver injury in rats by suppressing ER stress (16). There was a difference in the amount of a-tocopherol between the 2 TPN solutions. a-Tocopherol is a well-known lipophilic antioxidant that has the ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals (22). Nandivada et al (19) reported that the risk factors of cholestasis and hepatic injury observed in PNALD included elevated serum concentrations of phytosterols, an abundance of v-6 PUFAs, and a relative paucity of a-tocopherol. Moreover, previous research indicated that a-tocopherol protected against CCl 4 -induced liver damage (22). Unfortunately, we did not investigate whether the a-tocopherols play a role in the prevention of PNALD in the TPN-FO group.",
