Presence appeals to a wide audience that includes computer scientists, high-tech artists and media people, psychologists involved in the study of human-machine interfaces and sensorimotor/cognitive behavior, and mechanical and electrical engineers. ARTMargins publishes scholarly articles and essays about contemporary art, media, architecture, and critical theory. ARTMargins studies art practices and visual culture in the emerging global margins, from North Africa and the Middle East to the Americas, Eastern and Western Europe, Asia and Australasia. The journal seeks a forum for scholars, theoreticians, and critics from a variety of disciplines who are interested in art and politics in transitional countries and regions; postsocialism and neo-liberalism; postmodernism and postcolonialism, and their critiques; and the problem of global art and global art history and its methodologies. Computer Music Journal is published quarterly with an annual sound and video anthology containing curated music\u00b9. For four decades, it has been the leading publication about computer music, concentrating fully on digital sound technology and all musical applications of computers. This makes it an essential resource for musicians, composers, scientists, engineers, computer enthusiasts and anyone exploring the wonders of computer-generated sound.",

The first American academic journal to examine design history, theory, and criticism, Design Issues provokes inquiry into the cultural and intellectual issues surrounding design. Regular features include theoretical and critical articles by professional and scholarly contributors, extensive book and exhibition reviews, and visual sequences. Special guest-edited issues concentrate on particular themes, such as design history, human-computer interface, service design, organization design, design for development, and product design methodology. Scholars, students, and professionals in all the design fields are readers of each issue. Design Issues is a peer-reviewed journal.

Contributions cover a range of time periods, from before European colonization to the present, and any subject germane to New England's history-for example, the region's literary and artistic productions, its political practice and philosophies, race relations, labor struggles, religious controversies, and the organization of family life. The journal also aims to demonstrate the importance of regional studies by encouraging work treating the migration of New England ideas, people, and institutions to other parts of the United States and the world. In addition to major essays, features include memoranda and edited documents, reconsiderations of traditional texts and interpretations, essay reviews, and book reviews. Nautilus is a different kind of science magazine. It delivers deep, undiluted, narrative storytelling to bring science into the largest and most important conversations we are having today.
