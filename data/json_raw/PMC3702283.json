            "text": "Cytokines such as interleukins are known to be involved in the development of neuropathic pain through activation of neuroglia. However, the role of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 1 (CCL-1), a well-characterized chemokine secreted by activated T cells, in the nociceptive transmission remains unclear. We found that CCL-1 was upregulated in the spinal dorsal horn after partial sciatic nerve ligation. Therefore, we examined actions of recombinant CCL-1 on behavioural pain score, synaptic transmission, glial cell function and cytokine production in the spinal dorsal horn. Here we show that CCL-1 is one of the key mediators involved in the development of neuropathic pain. Expression of CCL-1 mRNA was mainly detected in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion, and the expression of specific CCL-1 receptor CCR-8 was upregulated in the superficial dorsal horn. Increased expression of CCR-8 was observed not only in neurons but also in microglia and astrocytes in the ipsilateral side. Recombinant CCL-1 injected intrathecally (i.t.) to naive mice induced allodynia, which was prevented by the supplemental addition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801. Patch-clamp recordings from spinal cord slices revealed that application of CCL-1 transiently enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission in the substantia gelatinosa (lamina II). In the long term, i.t. injection of CCL-1 induced phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunit, NR1 and NR2B, in the spinal cord. Injection of CCL-1 also upregulated mRNA level of glial cell markers and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6). The tactile allodynia induced by nerve ligation was attenuated by prophylactic and chronic administration of neutralizing antibody against CCL-1 and by knocking down of CCR-8. Our results indicate that CCL-1 is one of the key molecules in pathogenesis, and CCL-1/CCR-8 signaling system can be a potential target for drug development in the treatment for neuropathic pain.",

            "text": "There are many reports that nerve injury triggers reactive changes in peripheral immune system and in neuroglial cells in both peripheral and central nervous systems. 4,11,12 In the periphery, activation of Schwann cells and resident macrophages recruit hematogenous immune cells, which subsequently invade the injured nerves. [12][13][14] In the spinal dorsal horn receiving the injured sensory afferents, activation of microglia is commonly associated with early establishment stages of neuropathic pain. 2,15,16 Cytokines such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-6, which originate from the peripheral injured area or from activated neuroglial cells in the spinal cord, are known to alter synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn. 13,14 Chemokines and their receptors are widely expressed in immune cells and in the nervous system. 17,18 Recent studies have shown that chemokines C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL-2) and CX3CL-1 induce tactile allodynia (when non-painful innoxious stimuli become painful) through activation of spinal cord microglia. 17,19 These reactive changes mediated through cytokines and chemokines develop in parallel with tactile allodynia, the latter being the main symptom of neuropathic pain. 20 CCL-1 (also known as thymus-derived chemotactic agent 3) is one of the well-characterized chemokines and is classified into the same CC chemokine group as CCL-2. CCL-1 is secreted by activated T cell, mast cells and endothelial cells and has important role as the chemoattractant for neutrophils and monocytes. 21 Although effects of CCL-1 on the immune cells are well characterized, the roles of CCL-1 in the central nervous system, and especially in the development of neuropathic pain, remain unclear. In this report, we found that CCL-1 is involved in the development of tactile allodynia following peripheral nerve injury through enhancement of spinal nociceptive transmission and activation of glial cells with subsequent release of cytokines.",

We examined the action of CCL-1 on excitatory synaptic transmission in the superficial spinal dorsal horn, in the substantia gelatinosa (lamina II), by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from mouse spinal cord slices. When holding the cell at \u00c0 70 mV, substantia gelatinosa neurons exhibited spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) with average frequency of 7.1\u00b11.0 Hz and amplitude of 11.4\u00b10.9 pA (n \u00bc 9). In four of the nine cells examined, bath application of CCL-1 (50 ng/ml) for 60-90 s enhanced the excitatory synaptic transmission as shown in Figure 5e; this action lasted for more than 3-5 min. In the CCL-1-sensitive cells, the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in the presence of CCL-1 were 174 \u00b1 11% and 110 \u00b1 6.3% of controls, respectively ( Figure 5e).

Iba1 mRNA levels significantly increased in the spinal cord at 1, 3 h and 1 day after injection of CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.; 179.8\u00b112.0, 168.4\u00b120.0, 149.5 \u00b1 20.0%, respectively; n \u00bc 4; Figure 7a). And we showed that CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.) induced increase and morphological change of Iba1-positive microglia 1 day after injection (Supplementary Figure S3). CD11b mRNA levels also significantly increased in the spinal cord at 1 day after injection of CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.; 249.5\u00b151.2%; n \u00bc 4; Figure 7b). It was reported that P2X 4 R on microglia are important for the development of neuropathic pain. 2,3 We examined the expression of P2X 4 R mRNA after injection of CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.).

In addition, we observed that CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.) induced morphological change and the number of GFAPpositive astrocytes 1 day after injection (Supplementary Figure  S3). Furthermore, we examined activation of microglia and astrocytes after injection of CCL-1 (25 ng, i.t.) using phosphor-p38 MAPK antibody (p-p38). CCL-1 induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK on microglia and astrocytes (Supplementary Figure  S2).

We next examined the effects of CCR-8 downregulation on tactile allodynia. We made CCR-8 knockdown model using transfection of siRNA against CCR-8. We confirmed that protein level of CCR-8 was reduced in the spinal cord 5 days after injection of CCR-8 siRNA (Figure 8a). The CCR-8 knockdown mice were subjected to PSNL 5 days after injection of CCR-8 siRNA. We examined the effect of CCR-8 knockdown on allodynia and coordinated motion using von Frey filament test and rota-rod test. Downregulation of CCR-8 reduced PSNL-induced tactile allodynia for 2 weeks (n \u00bc 5; Figure 8c). By contrast, downregulation of CCR-8 had no effect on coordinated motion (n \u00bc 5; Figure 8d).",

            "text": "The present study, for the first time, demonstrates that expression of CCL-1 in the spinal cord and DRG at the mRNA and protein levels is increased after nerve ligation, and the nerve ligation-induced tactile allodynia is attenuated by treatment with neutralizing antibody against CCL-1 and in CCR-8 knockdown mice. We further show that CCL-1 has an excitatory action on the glutamatergic synaptic transmission and phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits, NR1 and NR2B, in the spinal dorsal horn and increase expression of glial cells activation markers (Iba1, CD11b and GFAP) and cytokines (IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6). Our results therefore indicate that CCL-1 may be one of the key mediators of chronic tactile In this study, we showed that CCL-1-specific receptor, CCR-8, was expressed in not only neurons but also glial cells 6 h after nerve ligation in the ipsilateral side (see Figure 3). We suggested that increase of total CCR-8 protein after nerve ligation in the spinal cord by increase of CCR-8 expression on glial cells. CCL-1 mRNA showed only a transient increase in the spinal cord (see Figure 1e) and at 3 h, 1 and 3 days after nerve ligation in DRG (see Figure 1d). This indicates that CCL-1 may be mainly produced in DRG after nerve ligation. In the case of CCL-21 and CCL-2, they were produced in DRG after nerve ligation and were transported to neuronal terminals in the dorsal horn. 24,25 CCL-2 was released from neuronal synaptic vesicles in the spinal cord. 26 Similarly, we assume that CCL-1, which is produced in DRG neurons after nerve ligation, is subsequently transported to the spinal cord and then released. CCL-1 mRNA in the spinal cord at 3 h after nerve ligation was also produced in glial cells albeit only transiently; this however, requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Immune cells and glial cells interact with neurons to alter pain sensitivity and to mediate the transition from acute to chronic pain. 11,14,19 It is generally believed that microglia are involved in the development and astrocytes in the maintenance of neuropathic pain. [27][28][29] Cytokines are important messengers for the communication between neurons and glia. 11,13,30 Injection of CCL-1 into the spinal cord increased the mRNA level of microglial (CD11b or Iba1) and astroglial (GFAP) markers, as well as that of cytokines (IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6) (see Figure 7). We also observed double staining of GFAP or CD11b with p-P38 after i.t. injection of CCL-1, suggesting that microglia and astrocytes were in reactive states (see Supplementary Figure S2). Activation of microglia in the spinal dorsal horn following peripheral nerve injury is well characterized. 2,31 The mechanisms of nerve injuryinduced microglial activation are complex and involve several signaling systems. 32 Purinergic signaling mediated through P2X 4 , P2X 7 and P2Y 12 receptors seems to contribute to the initial activation of microglia following acute nerve injury. 2,3,16,31,33,34 We, however, failed to identify changes in P2X 4 receptor mRNA in the spinal cord after injection of CCL-1. This suggests that CCL-1-mediated activation of microglia does not involve the upregulation of P2X 4 receptors but engages distinct signaling cascade(s). Several reports have previously demonstrated that cytokines and chemokines activate microglia and astrocytes, inducing secretion of proinflammatory factors (e.g., IL-1b, TNF-a, BDNF, IL-6, IL-17, CCL-2). 2,12,27 Several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in altered nociceptive processing. 12 TNF-a enhanced synaptic efficacy by increasing surface expression of AMPA receptors. 35 IL-1b modulates sensory neuron transmission via increased release of the nociceptive neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin generelated peptide. [36][37][38] IL-1b also induced the phosphorylation of NR1. 39 IL-6 was reported to be involved in the development of neuropathic pain. 40 By contrast, there are some reports that IL-6 has neuroprotective effect in the central nerve system. 41 IL-1b and TNF-a induced IL-6 expression in cultured neurons and astrocytes. 42 According to these reports, it might be reasonable that a peak expression of IL-6 in the spinal cord occurred later compared with that of TNF-a and IL-1b after injection of CCL-1 (see Figure 7g). These results indicate that CCL-1 is involved in the development of allodynia through glial activation and expression of cytokines. However, other signaling molecules can be also involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. Effects of CCL-1 on glial function need to be investigated in more detail in the future.",

            "text": "We showed that allodynia induced by injection of CCL-1 was blocked by co-injection of NMDAR antagonist. We assumed that CCL-1 enhanced glutamate release from presynaptic terminal or affected postsynaptic NMDARs. We confirmed that CCL-1 affected both, increasing glutamate release transiently and inducing phosphorylation of NR1 and NR2B gradually. As for the presynaptic effect, we showed that CCL-1 increased glutamate release only in some but not all neurons (see Figure 5e). Similarly, double immunostaining with anti-CCR-8 and anti-NeuN showed that CCR-8 expression was only in sub-population of neurons (see Figure 3), the reason of which requires further investigation. As for the postsynaptic effect, it is already reported that activation of NMDAR is important for initiating long-lasting changes in synapses and has been implicated in persistent pain by strengthening glutamatergic sensory transmission. 5 Though we did not directly check whether postsynaptic NMDA currents were enhanced by CCL-1 or not, we observed that both phosphorylation of NMDAR and increase in the number of NMDARs take place in response to CCL-1. Phosphorylation of NMDAR is known to modulate NMDAR activity and facilitate transmission of nociceptive inputs in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. 39 Partial ligation of sciatic nerve significantly increased the phosphorylated proportion of NR1 and NR2B subunits in the dorsal horn. 43,44 The phosphorylation of NR1 subunit is related to enhancement of synaptic efficacy and the development of central sensitization 7 days after nerve injury. 45 On the other hand, NR2B selective antagonist attenuated neuropathic pain. 46 Tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B, but not NR2A, is associated with the development of persistent pain. 47 In our experiments, CCL-1 induced phosphorylation of NR1 and NR2B albeit with different time course: Phosphorylation of NR2B was transient, whereas phosphorylation of NR1 continued for 3 days. In our behavioural experiments on pain score, injection of CCL-1 induced allodynia transiently, as phosphorylation of NR2B. As there is a report that NR2B is particularly important for pain perception, 5 we speculate that phosphorylation of NR2B would be more important than phosphorylation of NR1 together with upregulation of NR2B. As for the phosphorylation of NR1, IL-1b was reported to induce phosphorylation of NR1. 45,48 As IL-1b mRNA was increased in the spinal cord after injection of CCL-1 at 1 and 3 h (Figure 7e), we speculate that NR1 would be phosphorylated not only by CCL-1 but also by IL-1b.",

CCL-1 also induced phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits, NR1 and NR2B. Treatment with neutralizing antibody against CCL-1 and CCR-8 siRNA blocked nerve ligation-induced tactile allodynia. Therefore CCL-1 is one of the key molecules in pathogenesis of allodynia, and CCL-1/CCR-8 signaling system can be a potential target for drug development in the treatment for neuropathic pain. Drugs. Recombinant mouse CCL-1 and neutralizing antibody CCL-1 were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). MK801 was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).",

The methods used for obtaining spinal cord slice preparations are identical to those described elsewhere. 53,54 Mice were anesthetized with urethane (1.2-1.5 g/kg, i.p.), and a thoracolumbar laminectomy was performed. The lumbosacral segments of the spinal cord (L1-S1) were placed in an ice-cold Krebs solution equilibrated with 95% O 2 /5% CO 2 . The Krebs solution contained (in mM) 117 NaCl, 3.6 KCl, 2.5 CaCl 2 , 1.2 MgCl 2 , 1.2 NaH 2 PO 4 , 25 NaHCO 3 and 11 glucose. Immediately after removal of the spinal cord, the mice were exsanguinated under the urethane anesthesia. The pia-arachnoid membrane was removed after cutting all of the ventral and dorsal roots. The spinal cord was mounted on a vibratome and a 500mm thick transverse or sagittal slices were cut. The slice was placed on a nylon mesh in the recording chamber with a volume of 0.5 ml and was completely submerged and perfused with Krebs solution saturated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at 36 \u00b1 1 1C at a flow rate of 10-15 ml/min.",
