            "text": "Geocomputation: A Practical Primer is a timely book whose content will appear obvious in a few years time but would have probably seemed unusual, to say the least, just a few years ago. Its publication coincides with many substantial changes and shifts occurring in the world of computation, science, and geographic data. Although those are subjects for a different discussion, a few examples will help contextualize the moment in which this book has come about. Computing has been moving away from the desktop for a few years now: lighter, everyday tasks are pushed into ever smaller devices (tablets, smartphones, wearables, etc.), while more heavy-duty jobs are reserved for servers, data-warehouses, or somewhere else, all of it blurred through the convenience of the cloud. At the same time, the scientific endeavor is experiencing a crisis of public trust and reliability and more open and reproducible approaches are being proposed as the best way to keep science credible and useful for society (Peng, 2011). The data deluge produced by the digital era we live in is shifting the interest from classical statistical methods designed for \"reliable little data\" to machine learning and pattern recognition techniques created for \"messy big data.\" Closer to the discipline of geography, there is a strong push to take cartography from static publication-ready formats onto the web, opening the door for engaging interactive features and much richer presentations. How these and other changes will affect geocomputation is unclear. Some will probably pass and soon be forgotten, while some others will foreseeably remain with us and, in the process, redefine the way we understand the discipline. With such uncertainty ahead, the temptation to write a \"classical\" book, one that relies on the topics, methods, and approaches we have \"known and loved\" for decades, is very strong. Fortunately, that was not the route chosen by Brunsdon and Singleton.",

The book is structured around four blocks of three to four chapters each, revolving around common broad topics but mixing more theoretical approaches with eminently practical articles. The first part, \"Describing how the world looks,\" considers geocomputational approaches to representing the world, from the very microlevel, such as the one on 3D geosimulation (Torrens, chapter 2), to very macrolevel views on rank size and power laws (Batty, chapter 3). \"Exploring movements in space,\" part 2, considers several approaches to the blending of space and time, as well as dynamic modeling. Topics like the combination of agentbased modeling and Geographic Information Science (GIS) (Crooks, chapter 4), or microsimulation (Harland and Birkin, chapter 5), find their place in this part of the book, but so do more general overviews about circular statistics (Rohde and Corcoran, chapter 7) or storage, management, and analysis of large space-time datasets (Miller, chapter 6). In part 3, \"Making geographical decisions,\" the editors have compiled a set of geocomputational techniques used in real-world applications to solve specific problems. This comprises geodemographics (Alexiou and Singleton, chapter 8), self-organizing maps (Spielman and Folch, chapter 9), kernel densities (Lewis, chapter 10), and location-allocation models (Tomintz, Clarke, Alfadhi, chapter 11). These are usually illustrated with a practical application, rather than merely described in abstract terms, which makes the reading much more intuitive and serves as a good starter for the nonexperienced reader interested in discovering the \"big picture\" of the techniques.",

The final section, \"Enabling interactions,\" covers several examples of new avenues for geocomputation that would have not normally been part of a more traditional book.

In particular, it is refreshing to see how all of these relate to open-source projects freely available to use. The landscape where the only choices to perform geocomputational analyses were proprietary, desktop, point-and-click, GIS programs, or custom routines in low-level languages such as C or FORTRAN is no longer the norm. Instead, an entire ecosystem of open-source software, more flexible than traditional desktop GIS and more accessible than low-level computer programming has emerged. Just a few years ago, it was not very clear that one day it would be possible to carry out serious research in geocomputation using only free and/or open-source software. That the field has evolved in this direction to a point where there is a full stock of tools (Rey, 2009) that realize such a vision is greatly inspiring and it is something that the larger community of researchers who have made it possible should feel proud of. The book contains an overview of open-source software for GIS (O'Brien, chapter 17), and two other chapters are devoted to the most common programming languages used in geocomputation, R (Cheshire and Lovelace, chapter 1) and Python (Rey,chapter 14). An additional chapter (15) by Brunsdon and Singleton elaborates on the idea of reproducibility, describing the concept, why it should be adopted, and how it can be realistically implemented. This bit echoes a larger debate that relates to the very core of what Science is about and how to keep it serving society in the 21st century, and its inclusion in the book is a reassuring sign of the forward-looking attitude of the editors.",

For a domain so wide, diverse, and eclectic as geocomputation, the selection of topics does a remarkable job of capturing some key themes, applications, and domains where geocomputational approaches are used and useful. This is further enhanced by the fact that the text lives up to the \"practical\" in its title: instead of delving into the thorough math underlying many of these techniques, each chapter presents the intuition and application, making it a very suitable companion for a graduate seminar in social sciences (e.g., economics or sociology), or for researchers from different disciplines with an interest in what geocomputation has to offer to them. Part of this success in meeting its own goals is undoubtedly related to the fact that the authors are among the key leaders in the field they are writing about, and thus are particularly well placed to write introductory texts that get to the essence without much of the underlying math. However, this is nicely complemented by a short section at the end of each chapter with a few key references for the interested reader to continue learning about the topic. Most of these do include some of the equation-heavy books and articles required to master these techniques, making the book a perfect introduction-a primer after all-with a clear path forward for the interested minds.",

In addition to the already mentioned new approaches to geocomputational software and tools, there is an explicit recognition that the data landscape is changing and that this will require adaptation to be able to extract the most value and knowledge. This is very clear in parts of the book, such as chapter 9 (Miller), which recognize the need to accommodate and properly represent these new forms of data. But it is also more subtly present in the choice of methods reviewed. For example, the inclusion of a chapter on self-organizing maps, a machine learning technique to reduce data dimensionality and visualize large complex datasets, is very much in that same spirit. Very welcome is also the role given by the editors to visualization. One could argue that graphics have always been an essential part of GIS and, by extension, geocomputation. However, it is easy to get lost in the complexity and computational aspects of some of the methodologies and assume that because the results come from very complicated techniques, the presentation of such results is of secondary importance. The book takes a clear stance on this and recognizes not only its importance, but its nontriviality, including chapters that walk the reader through some of the cutting-edge tools such as R, Python, or JavaScript libraries for the web.",

Arguably, the following are a reflection of my own interests and preferences, but I do think they would have made the book a slightly more complete and consistent one. I have two main remarks: one relating to the structure and the other one to the content. I think there could have been a bit more consistency in the structure of each chapter. While some chapters are practical applications of a particular method, others are a more conceptual overview. To some extent, this is unavoidable in an edited volume with so many and varied authors, and some would argue even desirable as it exposes the reader to a larger range of approaches and ways of understanding the field, and I agree. However, I think a more consistent presentation of different methods provides a better way to introduce the unfamiliar reader to a family of new techniques. I would have also enjoyed some discussion of how geocomputation does or should engage with the nascent discipline of data science. Data science is in some ways a buzz term around which there is much hype and in that sense, it is correct not to give it much attention as the risk of the fashion fading soon is too high. However, the strong emphasis it places on practical applications and the use of data and quantitative techniques in industry and policy warrant some respect. A chapter on how geocomputation fits into the field of data science and how this can help make the discipline even more useful and valuable would have been very welcome.",

Because of that, the discipline should be of interest not only for experts on these computational techniques, but also to a wide variety of students and researchers in the natural and social sciences. Particularly for those, the book is an excellent introduction that will provide a good overview of what is on offer, and how to make the most of it. Accessibility and spatial interaction are two core concepts in multiple social science fields, including regional science, spatial economics, transportation, geography, and city and regional planning. Although it is well accepted that these two concepts are interconnected, open questions persist on how to use their connections to provide an accurate measurement of one family of indicators (e.g., accessibility) through the other one (e.g., spatial interaction) and to better understand the economic and social benefits of accessibility improvement. The book edited by Conde\u00e7o-Melhorado, Reggiani, and Guti\u00e9rrez attempts to concentrate on these questions by assembling chapters written by leading researchers mainly from Europe.",

When accessibility is not measurable, it can be estimated by spatial interaction models using flow data. They further examine which specification of the distance-decay function is least sensitive to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) using Swedish data. These aggregate, social-physics-oriented estimations of accessibility are straightforward but somewhat arbitrary. McArthur, Thorsen, and Ub\u00f8e's research (chapter 3) is economics-oriented, developing a spatial general equilibrium model (SGEM) to endogenize the relationship between transportation network, accessibility, and relocations of residents and jobs. This study is particularly useful to understand how a change in transportation network (e.g., removing topographical barriers) affects accessibility, how a change in accessibility leads to relocations of population and employment, and, in turn, how these relocations alter accessibility. Other advantages of SGEM studies are that they can track the change of accessibility and calculate an economically efficient or socially optimal level of accessibility.",

It is somewhat disappointing that the authors coarsely treat the spatial resolution of opportunities and overlook an examination of whether the resolutions of opportunities affects the accessibility computation. Given the location of an origin, the measure of accessibility could largely depend on the resolutions of travel opportunities, rather than the origin. Schintler, Kulkarni, Haynes, and Stough (chapter 5) offer an insightful introduction to how to use geosocial data to calculate accessibility and develop several social network analysis (SNA) metrics (i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, and entropy) to identify the positions (or importance) of locations within the U.S. network of counties. They also apply a community detection algorithm to find the \"mobility sheds\" (p. 107) and identify territories with close spatial interaction. While the SNA approach generates an innovative understanding of accessibility and spatial interaction, the authors mistakenly regard betweenness centrality as accessibility (p. 97). There are particular indicators in SNA that measure accessibility or reachability, e.g., closeness centrality. Also, we would expect a more thorough comparison of the accessibility computation based on the SNA and traditional approach (e.g., potential accessibility indicators).",

This spatial analysis demonstrates the importance of spatial dependence in accessibility measures but cannot clarify the causality between accessibility and demographics (e.g., whether high population densities attract more infrastructure investment, leading to a high level of accessibility, or high accessibility facilitates population clustering). Salas-Olmedo, Conde\u00e7o-Melhorado, and Guti\u00e9rrez (chapter 7) measure the border effects on intranational and international interaction through manufacturing trade among European nations. They also evaluate how these border effects vary with the distance metrics employed and affect the computation of accessibility (or market potential).

Arbu\u00e9s, Mayor, and Ba\u00f1os (chapter 9) examine the output effects of the accessibility of road transportation infrastructure, simply measured by the distance-decay sum of the population in all other provinces in Spain. Holl (chapter 10) uses a similar measure of accessibility at the municipality level in Spain also and tests its impact on firm-level total factor productivity. Both chapters rely on panel data models and control for the effects of production externalities, measured by spillovers to neighboring regions (chapter 9) or agglomeration benefits from the denser population (chapter 10). They are solid empirical studies. However, both fail to discuss the endogeneity between accessibility and production externalities: that is, how accessibility could affect spillovers and agglomeration and indirectly affect productivity. As later noted by Gr\u00e5sj\u00f6 and Karlsson in the last chapter, the measure of accessibility \"incorporates 'global' spillovers and does not only account for the impact from neighbors or locations within a certain distance band\" (p. 229). The latter is often done by spatial dependence models (e.g., the spatial Durbin model in chapter 9). Thus, accessibility could play a more important role in spatial economics than spatial dependence. By reviewing various empirical studies in Sweden, Gr\u00e5sj\u00f6 and Karlsson further encourage a more extensive application of the accessibility approach in spatial economics studies, including the analysis of knowledge spillovers, spatial variations of productivity and economic growth, new firm formation and locational dynamics, exports, and labor mobility. This is a valuable reminder at the end of the book that there is a complex interplay between accessibility and spatial economics and that the accessibility approach remains overlooked or undervalued in related empirical studies.",

These chapters represent the state of the art but meanwhile highlight the complexity of situating accessibility within the framework of spatial interaction theory. Much more work is needed to investigate how accessibility affects the spatial distribution of opportunities and spatial interaction and, in turn, how they change accessibility. For empirical studies, a reduced-form estimation probably cannot accurately reflect the connection between spatial interaction and accessibility and structural models are needed. Many chapters in this book are useful contributions to help develop accurate accessibility computations, for example, through the articulation of the influence of the functional specification of distance decay, spatial resolutions, topographical and border constraints, and spatial dependence. Is it rather disappointing, however, that the measures of accessibility devised in the spatial economics contributions presented in Section III are oversimplified. The coarseness of these measures of accessibility could lower the credibility of the estimated relationship between accessibility and space economy. Also, this volume would have benefitted from a review (or synthesis) of the state of the art in accessibility measurement across different empirical applications either at the beginning or at the end of the volume.",

Concerning land ownership, the argument is that rich people from outside buy land as consumption and make land unproductive for traditional uses while changing the local multiplier effects of the land value. All this can be done without any restriction to avoid that process (p. 59) and this is strongly associated with the gradual disappearance of small ethnic communities, long protected or disguised in regions close to remote national borders (p. 241). Finally, vis-\u00e0-vis political participation, there is some evidence that although collaborative management is becoming easier through the use of digital technologies (p. 173), seasonal amenity migrants usually do not attend public meetings and do not volunteer for collective works (p. 151) while generating high hidden costs because developing land as properties fragments the ecosystems and creates pressure to protect those fragments from wild fires at the expense of others (p. 177).",

Even without reason could we make a divide between, on the one hand, the good guys of nomadic, emotional, intuitive and smart authors, and, on the other hand, the folkloric settlers? And vice-versa when the supposed good guys are the bad ones? Labeling places or people as either rural or urban is not particularly useful (p. 273). In fact, there seems to be a flexible cycle of amenity migration-from visitors, to seasonal migrants and to long-term outsiders that then can sell their houses or hand them over to relatives (pp. 288 and 373), eventually generating long-term equilibriums between tradition and globalization (p. 306). As happens in any migration movement, there are the ones that are engaged with the place and the ones that become frustrated and move away (p. 323). In all, amenity migration is both an opportunity and a threat to sustain the integrity of natural ecologies and their symbiotic human communities (p. 11; p. 361).",

Amenity migration is a cysergic event, good and bad at the same time. On the one hand, it interconnects people and territories raising the value of both. On the other hand, it can degrade those territories with their people because it is based on unrooted and alien cultures that try to \"marry\" an embedded and often fragile ethos. Like any marriage, it can be paradise or hell. And like marriage, it only works with respect, trust, humbleness, and proximity-or love, using a less politically correct wording.",

The contributors to Immigration, Poverty, and Socioeconomic Inequality could hardly be pleased with the current tone accorded these topics in the looming presidential election. Editors David Card and Steven Raphael (as well as many of their contributors) have long produced critically informed research on how and why immigrants impact U.S.-born workers, the significance of demographic and economic shifts, and the socioeconomic trajectories of immigrants over time and across generations. Much of this compilation is more of the same, modeling a rigorously objective, question-led approach to a contentious field, while demonstrating the abundance of ways issues are framed and debated. In addition, the volume provides a timely focus on varying and changing state policies on immigration and welfare, and relatedly on the lives of young immigrants and members of the second generation. Attention to these authors' concerted efforts to answer urgent questions with innovative thoughtful approaches would significantly improve public discourse.",

Giovanni Peri and Ethan Lewis employ counterfactual simulations to formalize and test arguments of immigrant-native worker substitutability. Peri finds that new low-skilled immigrants diminish the wages of older less-skilled immigrants and Lewis finds similar effects operating through English language skills-but crucially neither finds negative effects for native-born workers. In a volume where geography provides analytical grounding in terms of comparing and disaggregating composition and policy effects across scales, the next two chapters are the most explicit about places. After finding that places with high levels of racial (black/white) segregation are also places of high immigrant segregation with native-born whites, Michael Stoll's intervening variable approach suggests a causal relationship between segregation and English language ability. Mark Ellis, Richard Wright, and Matthew Townley's chapter enquires about the changing relationships between immigrant poverty and changing locations. Their decomposition analysis shows immigrant poverty increased as the most disadvantaged immigrants sorted into lower waged cities pressed into higher poverty by the Great Recession. These authors are all able to test causal hypotheses through experimental models that formally specify relationships and disaggregate groups, places, and time periods.",

Renee Reichl Luthra and Roger Waldinger analyze group-variant intercepts and slopes of parent-child education and occupation as the interplay of origin country selection of parents and second-generation outcomes. In contrast to conventional upward or downward assimilation accounts, they emphasize significant intergenerational mobility of the second-generation overall, but also posit alternatives such as the \"working class incorporation\" (p. 201) of children of less educated Mexicans. The other chapters provide in-depth ethnographic investigation of different second-generation outcomes. Lee and Zhou explore the \"frames of achievement\" (p. 215) that condition 1.5/second-generation Asian success but are largely absent for 1.5/second-generation Mexicans. In a frame that affects some of Lee and Zhou's participants, Gonzales' study of young Mexican-origin adults illuminates the obstacles of undocumented status and how they unfold over a critical period for intergenerational mobility and adult outcomes. These authors stress the significance of parental resources and social and educational context for the large cohort of young adult and nearly adult children of immigrants.",

Douglas Massey's comprehensive historical analysis catalogues modern immigration policy and its racialized stigmatizing practice toward Mexicans and Mexican Americans. This provides an excellent set text for those unfamiliar with how Mexicans became so different from other immigrant groups but also sets the stage for analysis of contemporary policy shifts. Marianne Bitler and Hilary Hoynes similarly conduct a thorough analysis of how the status quo of relatively poorer immigrant households and children emerged from two decades' worth of increasing limitations on immigrants' access to social welfare. Sara Bohn and Magnus Lofstrum's synthetic comparison examines the probable effects of Arizona's recent Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), finding that it drove undocumented workers toward informal employment or out of Arizona, but failed to benefit legal immigrants or native-born workers. Cybelle Fox, Irene Bloemraad, and Christel Kesler test immigrant explanations (disenfranchisement, perceived group threat, and diversity) for reduced state welfare provision, but find only that states with larger black (and to a lesser extent, larger Asian and Hispanic) populations have less redistribution. With rapidly shifting state and federal policies, the context within which immigrants and others experience poverty or social mobility, these authors investigate the origins of the current system and its ongoing emergence.",

But this is a minor quibble for, overall, the tables excellently demonstrate the numerous relationships that condition hypotheses and their testing in this enormous and seismic field. The second-generation accounts could come from somewhere else as well as Los Angeles (even Europe), but they serve to illustrate theoretical differences in expectations, as well as the very different experiences by origin group. This 469-page volume is already a massive contribution. Challenging model approaches and findings are detailed in footnotes for specialists or skeptics, but explained in more comprehensible language for a wider public in the text. The multidisciplinary array of researchers is carefully modest, often asserting the limitations of their own approach while detailing it so carefully as to encourage scrutiny, critical attention to questions, concepts, and data, and further research. The writing is often exceptional, and the significance of the issues both theoretical and political made clear. Immigration, Poverty, and Socioeconomic Inequality should be of interest to any researcher working in the area. It deserves careful reading from any of us evaluating these issues, whether at work or at the ballot box. Edited by Philip McCann, this book is part of the collection \"International Library of Critical Writings in Economics\" published by Edward Elgar. It contains a selection of research articles with the aim of highlighting the major features and breakthroughs of spatial economics and economic geography for the last two decades. Twenty-four papers, ranging from 1997 to 2011, are organized within four sections of six papers each. The sections are entitled: \"Knowledge, Innovation and Geography,\" \"Cities and Clustering,\" \"Labour and Markets,\" and \"Empirics.\" A short introduction by McCann sets the tone of the volume: its purpose is to provide a sense of all the developments of the field, with its \"foundations and framework for understanding where the field is currently going, what the key questions and challenges being addressed are, and what the current consensus and disagreements are\" (p. xii). However, with a field as broad as this, some choices had to be made as to the topics chosen for the sections of the volume with a focus on innovation (part 1), cities (part 2) and land markets (part 3), and methods (part 4).",

Anselin, Varga, and Acs (chapter 1) provide evidence of the local geographical extent of spillovers between university research and high technology innovations, while Carlino, Chatterjee, and Hunt (chapter 3) show that patent intensity is positively related to the density of employment. However, as stated by Boschma in chapter 2, geographical proximity is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for learning but can strengthen the other dimensions of proximity. The factors behind innovative capacity are investigated in the following two chapters, with a comparative analysis between Europe and the United States undertaken by Crescenzi, Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, and Storper (chapter 4) and an assessment of the impact of variety by Frenken, Van Oort, and Verburg (chapter 5). Finally, in a somewhat disconnected paper, Shearmur and Pol\u00e8se (chapter 6) focus on the factors explaining local employment growth.

In an important contribution, Duranton (chapter 7) proposes a general model that accounts for the rapid location changes of industries across cities and the stability and skewed nature of the city size distribution. Specific aspects are then considered. On the one hand, the nature of the worldwide urban hierarchy is investigated in Henderson and Wang (chapter 11) with an attention to the role of institutions. On the other hand, the determinants of the location of industries and firms can be envisaged through the lens of Marshallian externalities. By constructing pairwise agglomeration indices for United States manufacturing industries, Ellison,Glaeser,and Kerr (chapter 8) show that all three of Marshall's theories of agglomeration are supported but that input-output linkages are particularly important. Industrial clusters stemming as a consequence from agglomeration externalities have attracted much attention as they have been seen as the basis for public intervention. The concept in itself is, however, ambiguous, as demonstrated by Gordon and McCann (chapter 9) and can be related to different models of processes (pure agglomeration, industrial complex, and social networks). Moreover, because of their specific properties, Storper and Venables (chapter 12) argue that face-to-face contacts should be considered as the most fundamental aspect of proximity. Hence, social interactions are facilitated in dense urban areas so that the resurgence of big cities is seen by Glaeser and Gootlieb (chapter 10) as resulting from an increased demand from these interactions.",

Other factors of migration are examined: community satisfaction in Mellander, Florida, and Stolarick (chapter 15) and the weather in Rappaport (chapter 17). In these two cases, the link with the title of the third part is not obvious. Two other papers focus on housing prices. A theoretical model of the growth of housing prices, including the effects of zoning and amenities, is proposed by Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (chapter 14). The role played by regulation is considered by Quigley and Raphael (chapter 16), who compare housing prices between more or less regulated cities and estimate the price elasticity of housing supply in regulated and unregulated cities.

The marginal benefits of public capital are estimated in Haughwout (chapter 22). A meta-analysis of urban agglomeration estimates is provided by Melo, Graham, and Noland (chapter 23).

However, precisely because the field is large and encompasses many different traditions, it cannot be exhaustive, as acknowledged by the editor. The choices of the topics (innovation, cities, land market, and methods) are relevant in their own right but not justified with respect to other issues that could have been tackled, such as the structure of cities, sociospatial segregation, agglomeration, and regional growth or local public economics. Moreover, while it provides a good mix between theoretical and empirical papers, the normative dimension of economic geography is relatively absent. Each part is more or less homogenous but the last part on methods comprises articles without a clear link between them. Rather than grouping disparate empirical contributions, it could have been interesting to provide here more methodological literature reviews in the spirit of Elhorst. Probably, a less ambitious title combined with some thematic narrowing would have been preferable. Despite these limitations, the book will be of interest for people wanting to have available a selection of quality research on various aspects of spatial economics and economic geography.",
