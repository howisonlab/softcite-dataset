Microorganism identification was performed by the provincial reference laboratory using traditional biochemical profiling, completmented with both the sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; antibiotic-susceptibility testing was also performed. After treatment with the appropriate antibiotics, the patient fully recovered. Systemic infections attributed to this organism are rarely reported in the literature. Other reported cases of bacteremia due to P dagmatis are reviewed and compared with the present case. The challenges of relying on standard automatic identification are discussed, with alternative methodologies provided. ",

A few days later, the patient developed fever, chills and weakness, resulting in a fall. He presented to the emergency room for assessment. Medical history and significant comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Grade 3 left ventricle. No immunocompromising illnesses were present. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 40\u00b0C, with bronchial breath sounds and crackles heard in the left chest; the bite wound appeared improved. A chest x-ray revealed a left perihilar infiltrate. Peripheral white blood cell count was 15.5\u00d710 9 /L, neutrophils 13.4 \u00d710 9 /L, hemoglobin 126 g/L and platelet nadir 14,000\u00d710 9 /L. The patient was admitted for further investigation and treatment. Blood cultures grew coagulasenegative Staphylococcus, which was considered to be a contaminant, and Gram-negative coccobacilli were later determined to be Pasteurella dagmatis. Treatment was initiated with oral azithromycin 500 mg per day and intravenous ceftriaxone 1 g every 24 h for five days. The patient defervesced within four days and his condition improved dramatically. Oral levofloxacin 500 mg was administered as step-down therapy for 10 days. The hematological abnormalities resolved. On follow-up three months later, he remained well.",

Three bottles produced Gram-negative coccobacilli with beaded ends in 14 h to 34 h, and one anaerobic/F bottle also produced Gram-positive cocci in clusters, which were subsequently identified as coagulase-negative staphylococci; this organism was considered to be a contaminant. The subcultures on blood agar plates produced tiny grey-brown creamy colonies, which did not grow on MacConkey agar. The Gram-negative coccobacilli were initially identified as Pasturella pneumotropica by the VITEK 2 system, software version 06.01 (BioMerieux, France) using the GN card, with bionumber 0001010210040001 and an excellent identification (probability 99%). Unusual bacteria such as this are routinely sent to the local reference laboratory (Public Health Ontario, Toronto, Ontario) for confirmation of identification and susceptibility testing. The susceptibility profile of the bacterium was interpreted by CLSI M45-A2 (1) ( Table 1).The biochemical characteristics (Table 2), 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing (below), as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) were used for identification of the bacterium.",

Based on CLSI MM18-A interpretation guidelines (5), due to the low level of demarcation of the sequence of the 16S rRNA gene between these species, the unknown bacteria may only be identified as P dagmatis or P stomatis.

            "text": "P dagmatis is a relatively new species for many clinicians. It is a Gram-negative coccobacillus belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family, which is fermentative, aerobic, nonmotile, oxidase positive and penicillin-sensitive. This organism has been isolated from both dogs and cats as normal flora, and also reported as a pathogen in human infections. It was previously labeled as Pasteurella \"gas\", Pasteurella new species 1 or P pneumotropica type Henriksen, and was eventually reclassified as P dagmatis (6). Bacteria from the Pasteurellaceae family cause zoonotic infections in humans, with P multocida and P canis being the most common Pasturella species reported in human infections (7,8). Infections caused by Pasteurella species are typically introduced by animals, particularly cat or dog bites, but also occasionally by other animals, and often manifest as skin or soft tissue infections (7-9). Sometimes, animal contact is not prominent in the initial patient history (10,11) ( Table 3). The most probable route of transmission of P dagmatis infection in the present case was most likely the bite and licking of the patient's traumatized skin by his dog, as has been previously described (11,12). Continuous shedding of P dagmatis from asymptomatic animals (eg, in dog urine [13]) and whether it can be an indirect route of infection to human remains to be investigated.    While Pasteurella species are well recognized for causing skin or soft tissue infections, P dagmatis can also cause more serious disease, including infective and prosthetic valve endocarditis (10,14,15), septicemia (11,12,16), peritonitis (17), vertebral osteomyelitis (18,19), chronic bronchiectasis (20) and pneumonia (21), mainly in immunocompromised patients. A small number of case reports describing systemic human P dagmatis infections are listed in Table 3. Interestingly, while Pasturella species infrequently cause systemic infectious disease, in our review of the literature, when P dagmatis infections are reported, they appear to be frequently associated with severe disseminated infection including bacteremia. Coinfections of P dagmatis with another Pasturella species have also been observed (9,12,22); therefore, it is important for the laboratory to test multiple morphotypes from the plate to ensure that >1 Pasturella species is not present.",

This is most likely because P dagmatis has not been included in the system database; as well, there has been a nomenclature change because P dagmatis was formerly grouped with P pneumotropica, type Henriksen. In a study that included 66 clinical Pasturella isolates and used sodA gene sequencing as a reference method, Zangenah et al (24) revealed that VITEK 2 only identified approximately 50% of Pasturella isolates correctly, while conventional biochemical tests and MALDI-ToF MS were able to correctly identify 94% and 89%, respectively. Interestingly, in the Zangenah et al (24) study, two P dagmatis isolates were not identified by VITEK MS MALDI-ToF (BioMerieux, France) and this limitation was also observed in our study (data not shown). The biological and genetic profiles among P dagmatis, P pneumotropica and P stomatis are very similar (Table 2); both a commercial biochemical identification system and the sequence analysis of a portion of the 16S rRNA gene were unable to differentiate between these species.",

It is probable that many clinical isolates of P dagmatis have been misidentified due to the limitation of commercial biochemical identification systems, such as VITEK 2. Misidentification may have contributed to an underestimation of the frequency of this organism in clinical samples; however, the growing use of MALDI-ToF MS systems for microorganism identification in routine clinical microbiology laboratories may allow for a more accurate picture of how frequently P dagmatis causes infections. Correct identification is important for diagnosis and therapeutic management, and epidemiological monitoring of the transmission of Pasturella species, particularly for the systemic infections such as in the present case. Unfortunately, most routine methods available at hospital laboratories cannot identify the organism correctly.",

To our knowledge, this is the first systemic P dagmatis infection reported in Canada. Clinical outcomes rely on early accurate laboratory confirmation and timely administration of effective antibiotic treatment. Conventional identification of P dagmatis using VITEK 2 can be misleading, probably due to the absence of this organism from the database; 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MALDI-ToF MS systems represent excellent options for identifying rarely encountered or difficult to identify organisms, such as members of the Pasturellaceae family. The present study re-emphasizes the need for continuously improving the database of automatic microbial identification systems.",
