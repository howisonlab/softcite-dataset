            "text": "In prokaryotic organisms, a substantial fraction of functionally related genes are organized into operons, each of which is a group of genes arranged in tandem on the same strand of a genome sharing a common promoter and terminator. Genes in the same operon are transcribed together as one messenger RNA. Having the knowledge of operons represents the next key step in deciphering the information encoded in a genome after its genes are identified. It represents the basis for elucidating higher level genomic structures, such as regulons and modulons as well as the cellular machineries, such as metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. In addition, operons, as the basic units of transcription and cellular functions, provide the essential information for experimental designs for studying cellular systems. A number of operon databases are currently available on the Internet. These databases contain information with varying levels of reliability and having different emphases. For example, OperonDB contains predicted operons for 550 genomes with documented prediction sensitivity at 30-50% on Escherichia coli (1). MicrobesOnline is a database with operons for 620 genomes with prediction accuracy at 85% and 83% for E. coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis, respectively (2). ODB contains both predicted and experimentally validated operons for 203 genomes (3). RegulonDB contains experimentally validated operons and associated transcriptional regulators but for E. coli only (4), collected from the published literature. And DBTBS is a database with similar content to that of RegulonDB but for B. subtilis (5).",

None of these databases provide the basic operon-centric tools in support of comparative genome analyses. We believe that the biological community could benefit from having a new operon database with high-quality predicted operons as well as high coverage along with strong querying capabilities. Our DOOR (Database for prOkaryotic OpeRons) database is designed to fulfill this goal."

Our prediction program employs two classifiers, one for genomes with substantial numbers of experimentally validated operons and one for genomes with only limited or no such data. For the first case, our program was trained on a subset of the known operons, using a nonlinear (decision tree-based) classifier utilizing both general features of genomes and genome-specific features, while for the second case, our program was trained based only on general features of genomes, using a linear (logistic function-based) classifier. The advantage of this strategy, i.e. combining genome-independent and genome-specific information when available, is clear as the program was recently ranked as the most accurate operon prediction program in the public domain by an independent assessment of 14 operon prediction programs, across all three performance measurements: prediction sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy (7).",
