            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of stroke, which is currently estimated by clinical characteristics. The cardiac biomarkers N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin highsensitivity (cTn-hs) are independently associated with risk of stroke in AF. Our objective was to develop and validate a new biomarker-based risk score to improve prognostication of stroke in patients with AF. Methods and results A new risk score was developed and internally validated in 14 701 patients with AF and biomarkers levels determined at baseline, median follow-up of 1.9 years. Biomarkers and clinical variables significantly contributing to predicting stroke or systemic embolism were assessed by Cox-regression and each variable obtained a weight proportional to the model coefficients. External validation was performed in 1400 patients with AF, median follow-up of 3.4 years. The most important predictors were prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack, NT-proBNP, cTn-hs, and age, which were included in the ABC (Age, Biomarkers, Clinical history) stroke risk score. The ABC-stroke score was well calibrated and yielded higher c-indices than the widely used CHA 2 DS 2-VASc score in both the derivation cohort (0.68 vs. 0.62, P , 0.001) and the external validation cohort (0.66 vs. 0.58, P , 0.001). Moreover, the ABC-stroke score consistently provided higher c-indices in several important subgroups. Conclusion A novel biomarker-based risk score for predicting stroke in AF was successfully developed and internally validated in a large cohort of patients with AF and further externally validated in an independent AF cohort. The ABC-stroke score performed better than the presently used clinically based risk score and may provide improved decision support in AF. ClinicalTrials. gov identifier NCT00412984, NCT00799903.",

            "text": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and treatable risk factor for stroke and systemic embolism. 1,2 The AF population is heterogeneous with a variable risk of stroke. 3 Development of risk stratification schemes in AF patients emerged in the 1990s and have thereafter been reconstructed and refined continuously. 4 -7 Current guidelines recommend a risk-based approach to decisions on anticoagulation treatment in AF based on the CHA 2-DS 2 -VASc score [which assigns 1 point each for a history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease, age 65 -74 years, and sex category (female gender), and 2 points for age \u226575 years and, prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA)]. 5 The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and other currently used risk scores are all based solely on clinical variables. Recently, it was demonstrated that biomarkers reflecting cardiac and renal dysfunction as well as inflammation and oxidative stress are related to the risk of stroke and other outcomes in patients with AF. 8 We demonstrated that cardiac troponin measured with high-sensitivity assays (cTn-hs), indicating myocardial injury, and N-terminal fragment B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), indicating myocyte stress, contained more prognostic information than most clinical characteristics in patients with AF. 9 -12 Based on these experiences, we aimed to improve risk stratification of stroke in AF by developing and validating a risk score that included the prognostically most important biomarkers and clinical characteristics. The project was performed in accordance with the recent TRIPOD statement. 13 The development cohort was 14 701 patients with AF with biomarkers measured at entry in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial, and the validation cohort was 1400 participants with AF and biomarkers measured at entry in the STabilization of Atherosclerotic plaque By Initiation of darapLadIb TherapY (STABILITY) trial. 14 -17 ",

Patients included had paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AF, or atrial flutter, and one or more of the following risk factors: age \u226575 years, prior stroke, TIA, or systemic embolus, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension requiring pharmacological treatment. Participants were randomized to warfarin (n \u00bc 9081) or apixaban (n \u00bc 9120). The primary endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism. The median length of follow-up was 1.9 years for the subset of patients with cardiac biomarkers available at randomization (n \u00bc 14 701) after exclusion of 45 (0.3%) patients with missing variables. A total of 1056 deaths occurred during follow-up. The median time in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin-treated group was 66.1 calculated by the method of Rosendaal. 14 The external validation cohort consisted of 1400 participants with AF or atrial flutter (689 on oral anticoagulation) and biomarkers available at entry in the STABILITY trial. The details of the STABILITY trial (Clinical-Trials.gov identifier: NCT00799903) have been published previously. 16,17 Briefly, STABILITY was a double-blind, international, multicentre, eventdriven trial that randomly assigned 15 828 patients with stable coronary heart disease to receive either once-daily darapladib or placebo between December 2008 and April 2010. Patients included had stable coronary heart disease and at least one of the following additional cardiovascular risk factors: age \u226560 years, diabetes, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of ,1.03 mmol/L, smoker of five or more cigarettes per day, moderate renal dysfunction (\u226530 and \u226459 mL/min), or polyvascular arterial disease. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and median follow-up was 3.4 years in this external validation cohort.",

As a first step, a model including all candidate predictors (listed in Table 1) was fitted. Separate models were derived for inclusion of cTnI-hs and cTnT-hs. Possible non-linearities were evaluated by transforming the continuous variables using restricted cubic splines, each with four knots placed at the respective 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th sample percentiles. To allow for different prediction models for subjects with and without a prior stroke, bivariate interactions between each variable and prior stroke were included. The global tests of any non-linearity or interaction were not statistically significant, wherefore the full prediction model included only main effects and linear terms. For a more parsimonious and clinically useful model, we approximated the full model by using a fast backward algorithm on an ordinary least squares model in which the estimated linear predictor from the full Cox model was the outcome and all candidate variables were entered in exactly the same manner as in the full Cox model. 18 Thus, in the first step R 2 \u00bc 1.0 by design and by removing variables in a stepwise manner, the full model could be approximated to an arbitrary level. The final model approximated 96.5% of the full model while only including the four variables: age, cTnI-hs (or cTnT-hs), NT-proBNP, and prior stroke/TIA. The strong correlation between age and creatinine clearance entailed that one of these biomarkers could be excluded without an effect on the outcome. Age was included as it is a readily available variable, and a required determinant for estimating creatinine clearance. As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted a competing risks model with stroke/ systemic embolism as the event of interest and death of any cause as a competing risk.",

            "text": "The ABC-stroke score is a novel biomarker-based risk score for predicting stroke or systemic embolism and was developed in a very large cohort of patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulation. The score included two biomarkers-NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin-hs-and two pieces of directly available clinical   information-age and prior stroke. The ABC-stroke score consistently predicted stroke or systemic embolism with a significantly higher accuracy than the guideline-recommended CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc risk model when validated internally using bootstrap samples and multiple subgroups. The ABC-stroke score was also found well calibrated and with consistent superiority over the clinical risk score in the external validation in a smaller cohort of patients with AF. The new biomarker-based ABC-stroke score was developed and validated in accordance with the recent TRIPOD statement and should therefore be acceptable for implementation in clinical care. The ABC-stroke score is simple, only encompassing four variables (Age, Biomarkers (troponin and NT-proBNP), and prior stroke or TIA as Clinical history). These four variables provided most of the prognostic information in multivariable models from the Cox analyses. When including the two biomarkers in the risk score model previously identified clinical risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases or gender, no longer carried any important incremental prognostic information. The biomarkers appear to add important information concerning subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction and were better associated with vascular vulnerability than disease diagnosis. 22 This might be explained by more information is gained by biomarkers being more sensitive indicators of myocardial stress and dysfunction. 23 -25 In contrast to other scores, using categorical irreversible risk factors, the proposed ABC-stroke score also contains continuous risk variables. The ABC-stroke score is dynamic with the opportunity to increase or decrease and would thereby be expected to allow monitoring of the patient's clinical condition and changes in risk of future events in either direction. 26 A dynamic risk score may facilitate its use as a decision support tool for selection of treatment in different clinical settings, e.g. in relation to the profiles of new treatments such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, when compared with warfarin. 14,23,27 Risk stratification with the ABC-stroke score indicated that the largest gain in  stroke or systemic embolism prevention with apixaban when compared with warfarin was obtained in high-risk patients. The ABC-stroke score includes two biomarkers, NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin-hs, both of which are readily available in most parts of the world. Even without a thorough understanding of the exact mechanisms, information on cardiac biomarker levels substantially improves the risk prediction in patients with AF. Other biomarkers, e.g. markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), oxidative stress (GDF-15), and coagulation (e.g. D-dimer), have in some studies shown associations with stroke in AF in addition to clinical risk factors. 8,28 However, these biomarkers were not included in the present evaluation, as they have not displayed independent associations with stroke in the presence of NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin, or are cumbersome to measure and assess in clinical practice. 8,28 Furthermore, in our sensitivity analyses (not shown), adding these biomarkers to the construction model did not add important prognostic information to the presented model.",

The large number of events and the relatively simple model appears to have prevented over-fitting as shown by the internal bootstrap validation and the successful external validation in an independent cohort of patients with AF. The new ABC-risk score seemed robust, since it provided similar information when based on two different troponin assays. Although the ABC-stroke risk score yielded a modest c-index of 0.68, it consistently outperformed the current guidelinesrecommended stroke risk score. It was also well calibrated as predicted event rates were associated with the observed event rates both in the derivation and validation cohorts. Evaluation of the score was also assessed in patients with ineffective and without anticoagulant treatment. Warfarin-treated patients with AF and a TTR below 58 -65% derive little or no net benefit from oral anticoagulation. 29,30 The consistent performance of the ABC-stroke score was strengthened by the consistent results in the subgroup of warfarin-treated patients with TTR ,65% during follow-up in the derivation cohort. The robustness of the score was further confirmed by the similar results in the cohort of patients without oral anticoagulation in the smaller external validation cohort. As prior stroke was the strongest risk factor in the score, it was important that the ABC-stroke score's performance was verified also in the subgroup of patients without prior stroke, indicating its usefulness also in the primary prevention setting. Thus, in all subgroups of both the derivation and validation cohort, the ABC-stroke score consistently achieved better prediction than the currently used CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, suggesting that this risk score may be an important step forward as decision support concerning stroke prevention in AF.",

The implementation of the algorithm used in the score will either be based on the nomogram or, preferably, based on an electronic tool integrated into electronic patient records or an online tool.",

The ABC-stroke risk score consistently performed better than presently used clinically based risk scores in terms of risk prediction and risk stratification, and may provide improved decision support in patients with AF.
