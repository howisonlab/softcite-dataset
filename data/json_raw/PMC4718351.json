            "text": "Introduction. \"Umberto I\" Teaching Hospital adopted 'Conley scale' as internal procedure for fall risk assessment, with the aim of strengthening surveillance and improving prevention and management of impatient falls. Materials and methods. Case-control study was performed. Fall events from 1 st March 2012 to 30 th September 2013 were considered. Cases have been matched for gender, department and period of hospitalization with two or three controls when it is possible. A table including intrinsic and extrinsic 'fall risk' factors, not foreseen by Conley Scale, and setted up after a literature overview was built. Univariate analysis and conditional logistic regression model have been performed. Results. 50 cases and 102 controls were included. Adverse event 'fall' were associated with filled Conley scale at the admission to care unit (OR = 4.92, 95%CI = 2.34-10.37). Univariate analysis identified intrinsic factors increasing risk of falls: dizziness (OR = 3.22; 95%CI = 1.34-7.75), psychomotor agitation (OR = 2.61; 95%CI = 1.06-6.43); and use of means of restraint (OR = 5.05 95%CI = 1.77-14.43). Conditional logistic regression model revealed a significant association with the following variables: use of instruments of restraint (HR = 5.54, 95%CI = 1.2-23.80), dizziness (OR = 3.97, 95%CI = 1.22-12.89). Discussion. Conley Scale must be filled at the access of patient to care unit. There were no significant differences between cases and controls with regard to risk factors provided by Conley, except for the use of means of restraint. Empowerment strategies for Conley compilation are needed.",

Some studies show that falls represent up to 70% of hospital accidents, entailing a direct physical and psychological impact [1,2]. Hospital falls, that involve death or serious harm for the patient, are treated, in Italy, as a sentinel event by Ministerial Protocol [3]. Falls have a multifactorial etiology and more than 400 risk factors have been described. The incidence of this phenomenon is prevalent in the elderly population, but the event can also occur in younger subjects; the causes may be attributable to diseases or physiological situations, fall is an event that, for frequency and consequences entailed, requires a multidisciplinary approach, articulated at different levels, aimed at the prevention and containment of risk, especially among older people [4]. Some studies [5,6] classify falls as:",

Risk of falling cannot be completely eliminated by care settings, but the early identification of patients at higher risk, allows us to identify and focus prevention, on a population that really needs [7]. In order to reduce the incidence of this adverse event, some risk assessment instruments are used to identify patients at risk. According to WHO, risk factors can be divided in two categories: a. intrinsic factors, which concern to patient health condition, they include data on reason of health care admission, co-morbidities and drug therapies; b. extrinsic factors, related to the organizational aspects of the hospital structure, environmental features and ergonomic resources, or health facilities employed [8]. Outcomes related to the adverse event 'fall' are a cause of costs increasing, due to prolonged hospitalization and further diagnostic and therapeutic procedures needed [9]. Moreover, in terms of quality of care, this kind of event can take on a negative ethical and legal features, for operators involved. The rating scales for risk of falls can be used both at the entrance of the patient in the hospital and for subsequent monitoring during hospitalization. Different scales have been constructed and applied during the last 20 years, eg. Conley, Morse, Tinetti, Stratify [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. However, a critical review of the literature published in 2003 emphasizes that none of these scales seems to have been sufficiently studied in terms of validity and reliability [18]. A problem of particular importance is the poor reproducibility on populations different from the experimental ones, that can result in an excessive expenditure of resources in front of a little benefit in terms of prevention [18]. Examining the different risk factors included in the risk assessment scales, it is easy to argue that some items are detected in two or more of them, even if with different formulations. Moreover, the most recent critical review of literature made possible to select and confirm a set of risk factors most important in terms of predictability, in particular: history of falls, balance and gait problems, impaired mobility, vision, orthostatic hypotension, use of different drugs, psychomotor status [19]. Latest trends consider risk assessment not based on the use of items and scores 'preformed', but rather on a detected core of individual variables. Conley Scale [10] was developed by D. Conley in the United States during a study conducted within medical and surgical Units, in 1999. An article regarding Conley scale, has established values of sensitivity around 69%, and specificity between 41% and 61%, therefore, the use of this clinical tool is justified by the good margin of accuracy and predictability in identifying true positives patients truly exposed to the risk of fall [20]. The main objective of this study was to identify factors that can significantly influence the phenomenon 'patient falls' in the hospital, and to describe conditions in which the event 'fall' occurs through monitoring application of Conley Scale, in different hospital departments. A case -control study was performed in the Teaching Hospital \"Umberto I\" in Rome.",

Medical records evaluations were compared and any disagreement has been resolved with the help of a third reviewer. Finally, data collected by extraction form have been inserted in an Excel file. In the statistical analysis, possible associations between patient falls and variables have been evaluated using Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t, Mann-Whitney and odds ratio (OR), with confidence intervals (CI) at 95%. The level of significance for all analyzes has been setted at p < 0.05. A conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between the outcome of being a case or a control and the set of prognostic factors (intrinsic and estrinsic). Parameters were estimated using conditional method for matched data [21]. The model fitted only included covariates resulted significant at univariate analysis. The likelihood-ratio test has been applied to evaluate the goodness of model. Data were analyzed using SPSS 19.0. With regard to Conley scale criteria, established by WHO, the present data confirmed that: the average age of cases was 69 years, while 64 years among controls. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.001). 54% of the sample took more than 4 drugs, 31% had critical clinical conditions at the admission, 37.8% showed hips weakness and 45.6% had unstable balance. 46% of hospitalizations featured a filled Conley scale at the admission to care unit. In addition to the main diagnosis, comorbidities informations have been selected among anamnesis data, and thereafter collected and compared between cases and controls. The most part of cases presented one comorbidity ",

The first two items increase the risk of falling , once and three times, respectively, the use of instruments of restraint, considered as extrinsic risk factor, increases the risk of falls over 4 times. The absence of filling in Conley Scale, at the entrance to care unit, predisposes to the event. The intake of more than four drugs, the critical clinical conditions, the weakness in the hips and the unstable equilibrium, have been confirmed as characteristics that increase the risk of falling. On the other hand, the presence of co-morbidities in addition to the main diagnosis, does not appear to increase the risk significantly. With regard to the category of drugs, antihypertensive and benzodiazepines are the most widely used among cases. There is small but a consistent association between the use of most classes of psychotropic drugs and falls; specifically, odds ratio for sedative/hypnotic use was 1.54 (95%CI, 1.40-1.70) Further adjustment for confounders, dosage, or duration of therapy are necessary [25]. In addition, a metanalysis that studied the relationships of falls and medications which included studies that examined both multiple and single risk factors found a significantly increased risk from psychotropic medications (OR = 1.7), Class 1a antiarrhythmic medications (OR = 1.6), digoxin (OR = 1.2) and diuretics (OR = 1.1) [26]. As regards the description of the fall, most of them occurs during night hours, inside the inpatient room, and they are due to loss of balance or force. In the 80% of cases no outcomes of damage were reported, such as to require further diagnostic tests, such as x-rays or tc.",

            "text": "Interaction and probable synergism between multiple risk factors, is probably important such as identifying risk factors. Several studies have shown that the risk of falling increases dramatically as the number of risk factors increases. Tinetti et al. reported that percentages of persons falling increased from 27% for those with no or one risk factors, to 78% for those with four or more risk factors [27]. Newitt et al. reported that the percentage of community living persons with recurrent falls increased from 10% to 69% as the number of risk factors increased from one to four or more [28]. As emerged from other study, profile of patient at risk of falling, is a person with mental status and mobility impairments [29]. Intrinsic risk factors were identified by Rawsky's review [30]: cognitive impairment/psychological status, acute/chronic illness and mobility, sensory deficits, fall history, and elimination, recent syncope episode and cognitive status [31,32]. Rubenstein et al. [7] analyzed 16 studies and reported the following risk factors, in order: muscle weakness, history of falls, gait deficits, balance deficits, use of assistive devices, visual deficits, arthritis, impaired activities of daily living, depression, cognitive impairments, and age 80 years. In general, factors related to cognitive impairment, functional decline, and chronic disorders result in a higher risk of falls [33]. Extrinsic factors (e.g., environmental hazards or hazardous activities) are described as primary causes for approximately half of all falls [34]. In a review of 20 articles, Connell [35] found that environmental hazards (e.g., walking on slippery/rough surfaces, obstacles, inadequate light, or loose carpets) create conditions for trips or slips in elderly people who may already have multiple intrinsic risk factors for falls. Additionally, the risk from hazardous activities can be increased by behaviors (e.g., faller was hurried or inattentive, difficulty or discomfort during a task, or moving beyond limits of stability). Within inpatient facilities, commonly reported extrinsic factors are related use of bedrails, height and stability of seating (low toilets, wheelchair braking problems, \"gerichairs,\" or portable commodes), and obstacles created by mobility aids (e.g., wheelchairs and walkers;). Finally, common locations for inpatient falls are resident rooms or bathrooms, with the falls often involving problems with ambulation and transfers [35][36][37]. Falls occurred most often in the patient's room when they were alone and unassisted while trying to get to the bathroom [37]. An effective and efficient fall prevention program should require quick, reliable, and valid fall risk screens to identify high-risk patients. In general, recommend criteria for choosing the most appropriate assessment tool for a specific setting should be: high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability [36]. Despite this, the specific instrument chosen might vary, depending on the setting and professionals engaged for filling. Nursing assessment scales seem the most appropriate approach for Acute Care Settings and extended care setting, where the majority of patients may be at high risk. A substantial number of fall risk assessment tools are readily available, most with evidence supporting their reliability and validity [36]. Frequent monitoring of drugs effects on patients is crucial, according to the most part of guidelines. Drugs with an increased need for monitoring, due to their important impact on the risk of fall are: antihypertensive and diuretics as it can cause hypotension and incontinence of urgency; hypnotics; hypoglycemic; neuroleptics because they can in-duce extrapyramidal disorders. The infusion therapy would take a break during the night rest, when possible. For prevention, containment and risk of falls multifactorial interventions are required in hospital , which ensure evaluative information essential for all types of patients, and educational interventions should be tailored to the risk emerged. A particular attention should be paid to periodic environmental assessment targeted on possible risk factors assessed. Needs of mobilization and ambulation requires special attention by the medical staff, it's important to educate patient and caregivers about the correct methods for handling and having a safe ambulation (eg. How to perform postural changes or movements from bed to chair, pass from sitting to standing without loss of balance). Patients and caregivers should be trained about aids and facilities, in order to avoid their misuse: encouraging the use of shoes with not slippery soles; instructing patients to get up slowly; assisting patients during high risk transfers (eg. from ambulatory to corridor once or vice versa). There is no scientific evidence in literature, that use of physical or pharmacological restraint protect patients from falls. Means of mechanical restraint can result psychological and physical adverse effects, direct and indirect. Restraint should be applied only when strictly necessary, supported by prescription or documented evaluations by the nursing care staff, after understanding causes and after taking all possible alternative care strategies, including relational interventions. Pharmacological restraints (sedation) is acceptable when it represents an integral intervention to the therapy. Alternatively to restraint, following initiatives can be undertaken: increasing surveillance, modifying treatments, preferring oral feeding to parenteral or nasogastric tube, removing catheters and drains. Further environmental changes could be: to increase the light in the room; to place a disoriented patient near a gatehouse; do not place bed rails; to create a peaceful environment; to keep the alarm-bell close to patient and answer immediately to calls; to use reality-orienting therapy (ROT) or other psychosocial interventions for involving patient in the conversation; to provide reference points (calendar, television, radio, clock); to use listening activities; to promote cognitive recreational and physical activities. Finally, as Tinetti et al. argued in a previous study [37], all prevention interventions are aimed at increasing nursing awareness of patient risk and involving patient and caregivers: teaching them; promoting patient independence and decreasing use of restraints; and, finally, paying attention to patients with impairments or altered elimination patterns (incontinence, frequency, nicturia). Our results bear out the evidence of scientific literature about Conley employment in assessing fall risk. Lovallo et al. comparing Conley Scale and Hendrich Risk Model [37], stated that Conley Scale gave sensitivity and specificity values of 69-49% and 61% respectively. The Hendrich Model [37] gave a sensitivity value of 45-76% and a specificity value of 71%. Conley Scale is more indicated for use in medical and surgical sectors on the strength of its high sensitivity and specificity, since its specificity is very low it is deemed useful to submit individual patients giving positive results to more in-depth clinical evaluation [22]. Conley Scale doesn't investigate some important clinical characteristics of patient that can represent a risk, like: visual impairment [14] and sensor-motor functions, incontinence, asthenia, cognitive impairments or sedation [14,27], and depression; likewise it is important to assess environmental conditions and the use of assistive devices, as well [22].",

The most part of cases have been recorded in Neurology Department, and it is already acknowledged that several diseases have been shown to increase the risk of fall such as Alzheimer's disease [39], Parkinson's disease [28], and stroke [40].
