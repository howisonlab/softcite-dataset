            "text": "Guinea pigs were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet (0.25 g/100 g cholesterol) and randomly allocated either to a Control group (n = 9) or to a Lutein (0.1 g/100 g) group (n = 10) for 12 weeks to evaluate oxidative stress and inflammation in both liver and eyes. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and inflammatory cytokines were measured as well as hepatic nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) binding. Lutein concentrations were greater in eyes (P < 0.01) and liver (P < 0.001) in the Lutein group. All guinea pigs had high concentrations of hepatic cholesterol as well as high plasma ALT and AST levels indicative of liver injury. However, the Lutein group had 43% lower hepatic free cholesterol than the Controls (P < 0.05). Hepatic MDA and MDA in the eye were lower in the Lutein compared to the Control group (P < 0.05). Hepatic tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was 32% lower in the Lutein group (P < 0.05). Lastly, the Lutein group presented lower NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity than the Control group (P < 0.001). These results suggest that in the presence of high cholesterol, lutein exerts both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which can be explained by attenuated NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity. Furthermore, results also suggest that lutein accumulates in the eyes of guinea pigs to protect against oxidative stress."

Retinal inflammatory reaction is suggested as a pathogenic factor in most retinal diseases including AMD [3,4]. Furthermore, oxidative stress is known to contribute to retinal inflammatory reactions. In an experimental animal model, oxidative damage in the outer retina and induction of inflammation contribute to the development of AMD [4]. However, whether the administration of lutein reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in eyes and has a protective effect during inflammatory states remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "Recent studies have also suggested that lutein can reduce atherosclerosis and exert cardiac protection [5,6]. However, there are not sufficient reports on the effects of lutein on other degenerative conditions, such as liver injury, and its underlying mechanisms. A small number of in vivo studies have suggested that this carotenoid may protect the liver against oxidation [7,8]. In the aspect of anti-inflammatory effects, previous studies have shown that lutein inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation in animal models and in RAW 264.7 macrophages [9,10]. A recent study also reported that dietary lutein decreased interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 mRNA levels in the liver of F-line turkeys challenged with LPS injection [11]. The mechanism by which lutein down-regulates inflammatory responses in the liver has not been fully investigated. However, several studies have suggested an association between nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway and a wide variety of pathological conditions in the liver [12][13][14]. Based on these observations, it is possible that the mechanism by which lutein attenuates the inflammatory state in the liver may be mediated through NF-\u03baB pathways.",

High cholesterol diets (0.25%) have been shown to increase hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation compared to low cholesterol diets (0.04%) [16,17]. This excess lipid accumulation in the liver may lead to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [18]. We have previously demonstrated that lutein decreases cholesterol accumulation, oxidative damage and inflammation in aortas of guinea pigs [19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that lutein accumulation in the eyes of guinea pigs could protect against oxidative stress and inflammation. Further we tested the hypothesis that lutein could prevent degenerative conditions in the liver of guinea pigs fed with high cholesterol diet by reducing lipid peroxidation and attenuating pro-inflammatory cytokine production.",

In this study, we observed greater lipid accumulation in guinea pig liver compared to those treated with low concentrations of dietary cholesterol [24]. It is important to note that there were no differences in hepatic total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations between the two groups in the present study. Consistent with these results, it is reported that fat content of liver was independent of amounts of dietary lutein in Japanese quail [25]. However the Lutein group presented significantly lower percent distribution of free cholesterol in hepatic total cholesterol compared to the Control group. Additionally, percent distribution of free cholesterol presented strong positive correlations with both plasma ALT and AST levels. Therefore, the larger portion of free cholesterol in the Control group may increase the risk of liver injury. Lipid composition of human liver demonstrated almost 2-fold increase in free cholesterol content in subjects with NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) compared to normal subjects [26]. It is suggested that several abnormalities that can be observed in NAFLD including mitochondrial abnormalities and impaired adenosine triphosphate synthesis may potentially contribute to the increase in hepatic free cholesterol contents [27,28].",

The excessive lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals leads to oxidative stress, which results in the accumulation of MDA. MDA is one of the end products of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress [30]. It is well known that lutein is a beneficial antioxidant due to its structural characteristics consisting in centrally localized conjugated C = C double bonds, which can readily quench reactive oxygen species [31]. Additionally, hydroxyl groups attached to each of the 2 terminal \u03b2, \u03b5-ionone rings make lutein scavenge free radicals more efficiently than other carotenoids [32]. Collectively, the antioxidant effects of lutein may attenuate the oxidative stress and the production of MDA. In the present study, the lutein treated guinea pigs presented lower MDA production in liver compared to the control guinea pigs. In addition, hepatic lutein concentrations were negatively correlated with hepatic MDA concentrations, which clearly indicates that lutein may inhibit lipid peroxidation.",

            "text": "Liver injury by pro-inflammatory cytokines is another major factor to induce liver disease [18]. In particular, NF-\u03baB, a major transcriptional factor involved in cell survival, immunity and inflammation, is activated during liver injury [12]. NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine production regulate the maintenance of liver homoeostasis as well as the pathogenesis of a wide variety of liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [14]. It has been shown that lutein directly decreases NF-\u03baB activation and suppresses both mRNA and protein levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. Peroxisome proliferator X receptor (PPAR) and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) are members of nuclear hormone receptors and they regulate NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokine production [33]. One recent study suggested that LPS-induced PPAR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b1 down-regulation was partially reversed by increasing the dietary lutein content to 50 mg/kg in chickens [34]. Therefore, based on these studies, an anti-inflammatory effect of lutein may be explained by direct inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation or PPAR\u03b1 /RXR\u03b1-mediated regulation. Consistent to these studies, we found that guinea pigs from the Lutein group presented significantly lower hepatic TNF-\u03b1 concentration than guinea pigs from the Control group. In agreement with our study, mice with D-galactose-induced liver injury also showed that 40 mg/kg/day of lutein treatment lowers iNOS content in the liver [35].",

Serum ALT concentrations have been associated with decreased serum antioxidant concentrations, particularly carotenoids [36]. Additionally, Several animal studies suggest that lutein lowers ALT and AST concentrations due to scavenging of reactive oxygen radicals in rats with paracetamol-, carbon tetrachloride-and ethanol-induced hepatic injury [7,37]. However, these studies used higher amount of lutein (50, 100, 250 mg/day) than in the current investigation (30 mg/day).",

Not only by filtering the blue light, which is the most damaging wavelength of light that reaches the retina [39] but also by readily quenching singlet oxygen species [40], lutein protects the eye from oxidative stress. In the current study, lutein was successfully detected in the eyes of guinea pigs with lutein treatment and they presented lower concentrations of MDA compared to guinea pigs without lutein treatment. We also observed lower pro-inflammatory cytokine productions with lutein treatment in the eye and consistent with our study, pro-inflammatory cytokine productions in the aqueous humor of rats with endotoxin-induced uveitis were reduced with 100 mg/kg lutein administration [9]. This result was explained by suppression of NF-\u03baB activation with lutein, therefore lutein might be involved in the regulation NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the eye as well.",
