Rapid, simple, and economical detection methods for these major waterborne protozoa in environmental and clinical samples are necessary to control infection and improve public health. In the present study, we developed a multiplex PCR test that is able to detect all these 3 major waterborne protozoa at the same time. Detection limits of the multiplex PCR method ranged from 10 1 to 10 2 oocysts or spores. The primers for microsporidia or Cryptosporidium used in this study can detect both Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis, or both Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum, respectively. Restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products with BsaBI or BsiEI makes it possible to distinguish the 2 species of microsporidia or Cryptosporidium, respectively. This simple, rapid, and cost-effective multiplex PCR method will be useful for detecting outbreaks or sporadic cases of waterborne protozoa infections.",

These protozoans have several common characteristics biologically. Their major habitat is intestinal epithelial cells, and they are all intracellular parasites [1]. In addition, they produce infectious spores that are excreted from the hosts in their stools [2]. Although these protozoa are a concern for AIDS-infected individuals, they are gaining recognition as important infective organisms in immunocompetent individuals as well [1,3,4].",

            "text": "There are various detection methods currently available for microsporidia, Cyclospora, and Cryptosporidium. These include  morphological examination after specific staining, fluorescence microscopy after specific antibody labeling, and molecular diagnosis with such methods as PCR [2,12,13]. Although it is inexpensive and fast, the classical staining method depends on highly trained experts for accurate diagnosis. Immunofluorescencebased antibody-labeling methods depend on the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies against parasites for the accurate diagnosis, and cross-reactivity or nonspecific labeling can be a challenge. Multiplex PCR would eliminate the need for a highly trained expert and would reduce the diagnostic time by being able to catch 3 kinds of protozoa at the same time. If well-designed multiplex PCR having a high sensitivity and specificity is available, it would be an excellent diagnostic method for these waterborne protozoa. The primers used for Cyclospora in this study were designed by Relman et al. [14]. Orlandi and Lampel [9] reported a sensitivity level for Cyclospora that was as low as 3 oocysts using nested PCR with the same primer set, which is similar to the level of sensitivity in our study. In addition, Orlandi and Lampel [9] described a detection sensitivity of C. parvum and E. intestinalis of as few as 10 oocysts from singleplex PCRs with each parasite DNA [9]. Their detection sensitivity for E. intestinalis is 10-fold higher than our results; however, they did not report the sensitivity of multiplex PCR using mixed DNA of each protozoan. Furthermore, agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of PCR products from both the first and second rounds of PCR is necessary to confirm the detection results with the method described by Olandi and Lampel [9], because that method amplified the C. parvum target only during the first round of PCR.",

We did not show restriction enzyme-digested PCR products of E. bieneusi and C. hominis in the present study as we did not secure DNAs of these 2 organisms. Instead, we confirmed the results of restriction enzyme digestion of these 2 organisms after PCR using a restriction enzyme cutting software program (Clone Manager 6).",

Therefore it is quite difficult to develop specific primers for these 2 protozoa. The difficulty is especially challenging for Cyclospora because PCR detection of the 18S rRNA gene could be confused with that of Eimeria spp., which show 98% similarity with the 18S rRNA gene sequence of Cyclospora. Thus sequence analysis after multiplex PCR should be performed for the accurate differential diagnosis of Cyclospora and Eimeria spp.",
