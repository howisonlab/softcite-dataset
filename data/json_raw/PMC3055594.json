            "text": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis arabinogalactan (AG) is an essential cell wall component. It provides a molecular framework serving to connect peptidoglycan to the outer mycolic acid layer. The biosynthesis of the arabinan domains of AG and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) occurs via a combination of membrane bound arabinofuranosyltransferases, all of which utilize decaprenol-1-monophosphorabinose as a substrate. The source of arabinose ultimately destined for deposition into cell wall AG or LAM originates exclusively from phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (pRpp), a central metabolite which is also required for other essential metabolic processes, such as de novo purine and pyrimidine biosyntheses. In M. tuberculosis, a single pRpp synthetase enzyme (Mt-PrsA) is solely responsible for the generation of pRpp, by catalyzing the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to the C1 hydroxyl position of ribose-5-phosphate. Here, we report a detailed biochemical and biophysical study of Mt-PrsA, which exhibits the most rapid enzyme kinetics reported for a pRpp synthetase.",

            "text": "The unique hydrophobic cell wall of M. tuberculosis forms a primary defensive barrier to the onslaught of toxic insult during the host immune response. The current chemotherapeutic regime used to treat TB includes the administration of isoniazid and ethambutol, both of which target crucial steps in the biosynthesis and the assembly of the M. tuberculosis cell wall (Banerjee et al. 1994;Belanger et al. 1996). However, whilst these cell wall inhibitors are excellent at effectively killing actively dividing cells, certain subpopulations of bacilli, labeled as \"persisters\", exhibit transient resistance to many of the drugs used to treat TB (Wayne and Sohaskey 2001). The precise molecular mechanism of this latent infection caused by persistent bacilli is poorly understood. However, in the pursuit of identifying suitable cellular targets and the development of new anti-TB chemotherapeutic agents, we must address the phenomenon of persistence to truly eradicate the disease. Recently, it has been shown that certain processes of metabolic pathways involved in mycobacterial cellular energy metabolism, such as respiratory ATP biosynthesis, represent excellent physiological targets for the effective killing of latent populations of TB bacilli (Koul et al. 2007(Koul et al. , 2008Rao et al. 2008;Bald and Koul 2010). Phospho-\u03b1-D-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate ( pRpp) is a central metabolite that links the pentose phosphate pathway to the de novo and the salvage biosynthetic pathways of purine and pyrimidine production, NAD and NADP cofactor biosynthesis, as well as histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis (Hove-Jensen 1988). It is therefore considered that pRpp is required at all times during the life cycle of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (Hove-Jensen 1989;Tozzi et al. 2006). In addition to these central metabolic processes, members belonging to the Corynebacteriacae, such as mycobacteria, have evolved an almost unique biochemical pathway, utilizing pRpp as a high-energy biosynthetic precursor for cell wall arabinan biosynthesis (Wojtkiewicz et al. 1988;Scherman et al. 1995Scherman et al. , 1996; Figure 1). The gene product of Rv3806c encodes for a membrane bound pRpp:decaprenol-1monophosphate 5-phosphoribosyltransferase (DPPR synthase) which catalyzes the formation of DPPR and pyrophosphate from pRpp and decaprenol-1-monophosphate (DP; Huang et al. 2005). DPPR then undergoes C5-dephosphorylation to decaprenol-1-monophosphoribose (DPR) and epimerization about the C2-OH position of the ribosyl moiety catalyzed by a two-step heteromeric oxidation/reduction process (Mikusova et al. 2005). In M. tuberculosis, Rv3790 encodes for an FAD-containing oxidoreductase (DprE1) which oxidizes the ribosyl C2-OH group to the keto sugar decaprenol-1-monophosphoryl-2-keto-\u03b2-erythro-pentofuranose (DPX) which is subsequently reduced by DprE2 (encoded by Rv3791) forming decaprenol-1-monophosphoarabinose (DPA; Mikusova et al. 2005), which is the sole high-energy lipid-linked substrate for the GT-C family arabinofuranosyltransferases (AraTs) which are involved in cell wall arabinan polymerization (Alderwick et al. 2007).",

Three arabinan domains are covalently linked via an Araf-\u03b1(1 \u2192 5)-Galf glycosidic bond to the 8th, 10th and 12th positions of a single linear polysaccharide composed of 30 alternating \u03b2(1 \u2192 5) and \u03b2(1 \u2192 6) Galf residues forming the galactan domain of AG (Alderwick et al. 2005). AG is a structural macromolecule and serves to function as a molecular scaffold linking peptidoglycan to the mycolic acids, forming a highly impermeable and hydrophobic layer surrounding the mycobacterial cell (McNeil et al. 1991). Arabinan is also present in the form of lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a highly immunogenic lipoglycan, which is involved in modulating the host immune response (Briken et al. 2004). In terms of chemical composition, arabinan represents 18% of mycobacterial cell wall biomass (Ortalo-Magne et al. 1995). Therefore, during cell elongation and division of the mycobacterial bacilli, it is necessary for there to be a readily available supply of pRpp for the efficient incorporation of arabinose into newly synthesized cell wall material. During this process, the metabolic demand for pRpp is likely to increase dramatically and the elevated levels required for effective Fig. 1. Proposed metabolic pathway depicting the importance of Mt-PrsA for the generation of pRpp in M. tuberculosis. R5P is generated via the catabolism of glucose through the pentose phosphate pathway, a process ubiquitous throughout nature. Like all pRpp synthetase enzymes, Mt-PrsA catalyses the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP to the C1-OH group of R5P forming pRpp and AMP. In a process unique to members belonging to the Corynebacteriaceae, such as M. tuberculosis, pRpp is utilized as the sole metabolic intermediate in the formation of DPA, which is a crucial substrate required for mycobacterial cell wall assembly.

Mt-PrsA displays an absolute requirement for inorganic phosphate for enzyme activation and will accept either Mg 2+ or Mn 2+ as divalent cations, which serve to coordinate the phosphate moieties of ATP during enzyme catalysis. Using a continuous enzyme coupled spectrophotometric assay, we report a detailed kinetic characterization of Mt-PrsA, which displays the highest specific activity measured for any pRpp synthetase studied to date. By investigating the oligomeric state of Mt-PrsA in solution and measuring the ligand-binding properties of its substrates, we provide evidence suggesting that the mechanism by which ADP inhibits Mt-PrsA activity, results from the binding of ADP to an allosteric site, and as a consequence, induces the stabilization of an inactive, hexameric oligomeric species.",

This is not unsurprising, considering the apparent physiological importance of Mt-PrsA in the provision of pRpp for central metabolic pathways and the formation of the cell wall biosynthetic precursor DPA (Wolucka et al. 1994;Scherman et al. 1995). We have previously used Corynebacterium glutamicum as an excellent model system for the study of complex cell wall biosynthetic processes, and we have reported the phenotypic characterization of several cell wall mutants, which would otherwise be essential in mycobacterial systems (Gande et al. 2004;Alderwick et al. 2005;Alderwick, Dover, et al. 2006;Seidel et al. 2007;Birch et al. 2008). A bioinformatics analysis of several Corynebacteriaceae genomes revealed that NCgl0945 (Cg-prsA) was the likely C. glutamicum ortholog of Mt-prsA (Rv1017c). These corresponding gene products share 71% identity (83% similarity), and the gene locus is conserved within the Corynebacteriaceae indicating that this region is syntenic. We attempted to inactivate Cg-prsA in C. glutamicum, by using the disruption vector pK18mob-Cg-prsA-int, carrying 304 bp of Cg-prsA. In a control experiment, we used the previously reported pK18mob-Cg-ppm1-int construct, which affords the successful inactivation of the gene encoding for the polyprenyl monophosphomannose synthase ( ppm1) of C. glutamicum, which is a gene of similar size to that of Cg-prsA (Gibson et al. 2003). Both inactivation vectors were used in parallel experiments for the transformation of wildtype (WT) C. glutamicum to kanamycin resistance (Kan R ). Whilst we were able to easily generate C. glutamicum Kan R colonies from the pK18mob-Cg-ppm1-int construct, we were required to conduct several rounds of electroporation using pK18mob-Cg-prsA-int before obtaining three separate C. glutamicum Kan R clones. This indicates that the recombination events appeared to have taken place at unexpected and, as yet, undefined loci. From this analysis, we concluded that Cg-prsA is an essential gene and its function is necessary for the growth and integrity of C. glutamicum, even when grown on rich Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium.",

A coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of Mt-PrsA revealed a band that migrated to a position of 35 kDa, which is in accordance with the expected molecular weight of Mt-PrsA, and was estimated to be at least 98% pure. To determine if recombinant Mt-PrsA was active, we performed a radiochemical assay to measure the pyrophosphate transfer from ATP to the C1-OH group of [ 14 C]-uniformly labeled R5P (Boss et al. 1984). Starting with [ 14 C]-U-D-glucose and replicating the first three enzymic reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway in vitro using commercially available enzymes (Roche and Sigma), we prepared a source of purified [ 14 C]-U-\u03b1-D-R5P as a substrate for subsequent enzyme assays. In a time course assay, recombinant Mt-PrsA exhibited rapid pRpp synthetase activity which was dependent upon the presence of either of the divalent cations Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ , with slight preference for the latter (Figure 2A). During the assay, p[ 14 C]Rpp is susceptible to product degradation due to hydrolysis of the labile C1-OH pyrophosphate bond, which accounts for the relatively small increase in band density (relating to p[ 14 C]Rpp) over the course of the assay. Addition of EDTA to the reaction mix inhibited the formation of p[ 14 C]Rpp (data not shown) and the inclusion of CaCl 2 , in replacement of MgCl 2 or MnCl 2 , also resulted in the loss of Mt-PrsA activity (Figure 2A). Mt-PrsA was found to be most active at a pH of 6.5, but also showed activity across a broad range of pH levels (4.5-9.5) and was only found to be inactive at high pH (10.5; data not shown). In accordance with previous studies of pRpp synthetases (Prs) from other organisms, Mt-PrsA was strongly inhibited by the presence of ADP, which has been shown to be an allosteric modulator of this class of enzymes ( Figure 2B) (Switzer and Sogin 1973;Gibson et al. 1982;Arnvig et al. 1990;Eriksen et al. 2000;Willemoes et al. 2000).",

Mycobacterium smegmatis has a direct ortholog of this phosphatase encoded by MSMEG6402, which explains the apparent conversion of DPPR to DPR observed in this assay. The combined addition of sodium fluoride and sodium tungstate (known phosphatase inhibitors; Stankiewicz and Gresser 1988) to the assay mix, results in a diminished level of DPR formation and a corresponding increase in a band migrating to a lower position on the TLC identified as being DPPR (Figure 3, lane 4). When Mt-PrsA is used in combination with M. smegmatis P60, two additional bands can be observed migrating in close proximity to DPR, which correspond to the subsequent conversion of DPR to DPX and DPA, by the endogenous P60 activity of DprE1 and DrpE2, respectively (Figure 3, lane 5; Mikusova et al. 2005). The inclusion of sodium fluoride and sodium tungstate dramatically reduced the conversion of DPPR to DPA, suggesting that the two-step epimerization of the C2-OH group of ribose by DprE1 and DprE2 occurs after 5' dephosphorylation ( Figure 3, lane 6). The inclusion of ADP to the reaction mix completely ablated the formation of any organic extractable material, clearly indicating that the ADP inhibition of Mt-PrsA results in the total loss of DPPR formation ( Figure 3, lane 7).",

AraT activity was measured after product isolation by organic extraction and analysis by TLC and autoradiography. AraT assays carried out in the absence of Mt-PrsA afforded no AraT-dependent product formation ( Figure 4, lane 1). Upon addition of Mt-PrsA, two closely migrating bands could be observed with the top bad attributed to \u03b1(1 \u2192 5)-Araf transfer to the acceptor by either EmbA, EmbB, EmbC or a combination and the lower band attributed to \u03b2(1 \u2192 2)-Araf transfer resulting from AftB activity (Figure 4, lane 2), as described previously (Lee et al. 1997). Addition of the EmbA, EmbB and EmbC inhibitor ethambutol (EMB), resulted in the loss of the upper band with only the lower band remaining, this being due to the noninhibitory effect of EMB on the terminal \u03b2(1 \u2192 2) capping enzyme, AftB (Seidel et al. 2007; Figure 4, lane 3). As a consequence of allosteric inhibition of Mt-PrsA and the resultant loss of in vitro Mt-PrsA-dependent pRpp formation, the inclusion of ADP in the assay mixture led to the inhibition of any AraT-dependent product formation (Figure 4, lane 4).",

This system (described in the Materials and methods section) enabled us to record detailed measurements of the steady-state enzyme kinetics of Mt-PrsA. Plotting the steady-state reaction velocity (\u03bd) calculated from Eq. 1, as a function of increasing concentrations of R5P at the saturating levels of ATP, results in a hyperbolic curve displaying the Michelis-Menton kinetics ( Figure 5A). Nonlinear regression analysis using Eq. (2) derived a K m of 8.2 \u00b5M (\u00b12.72 SE) for R5P and a V max of 530 \u00b5mol \u22121 min \u22121 mg \u22121 and a specificity constant (K cat /K m ) of 7.43 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 . As previously described using the radiochemical assay, Mt-PrsA requires the presence of Pi at a concentration of 50 mM for full enzyme activation, which is illustrated in Figure 5A. However, at reduced levels of Pi (5 mM), the subsequent addition of R5P results in partial substrate inhibition, an effect that has been observed elsewhere [Willemoes et al. 2000; data fitted to Eq. (3)], with little or no activity recorded in the absence of Pi ( Figure 5A). This is likely due to Mt-PrsA being incompletely activated by Pi at low [Pi], meaning that at low R5P concentrations, the relatively high-affinity catalytic site for R5P is occupied and the normal Micheli-Menton kinetics occur until R5P reaches a concentration that results in [ 14 C]-Araf-linked products were extracted from the assay mix as described in the Materials and methods section and subsequently applied to a silica gel TLC plates, developed in CHCl 3 :CH 2 OH:H 2 O:NH 4 OH (65:25:3.6:0.5, v/v/v/ v) and visualized by autoradiography from exposure of TLCs to X-ray film (Kodak X-Omat; Lee et al. 1997;Seidel et al. 2007).",

The inclusion of 5 mM R5P showed no apparent change in the equilibrium or oligomeric state of Mt-PrsA in solution, and the c(M) vs. Mw distribution aligned well with that of Mt-PrsA in the absence of ligand (Figure 7, red line). The addition of 5 mM ATP to Mt-PrsA resulted in an altered c(M) distribution with a peak centered over 70,000 Da, equating to a Mt-PrsA homodimer, and concomitant reduction in the intensity of the hexameric species, when compared with Mt-PrsA alone (Figure 7, blue line). Interestingly, when we performed a similar experiment in combination with 5 mM ADP, the ratio of c(M) distribution shifted toward an increase in the hexameric state with a corresponding reduction in trimeric species (Figure 7, green line). Mt-PrsA contains within its primary amino acid sequence, three naturally occurring tryptophan residues at position Trp 5, Trp 74 and Trp 188. We used intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) spectroscopy to probe the binding properties of R5P, ATP and ADP for Mt-PrsA. We performed a fluorescence emission (F emission ) scan of Mt-PrsA in solution by recording (F emission ) output between 300 and 400 nm, upon excitation at \u03bb 292nm . Mt-PrsA gave a maximum fluorescence emission \u00f0F max emission \u00de at a wavelength of 335 nm, thus providing a basal F emission coordinate for the collection of subsequent ITF data. The change in fluorescence emission (\u0394F emission ) was calculated by subtracting the F emission (recorded 5 min after each ligand titration) away from \u00f0F max emission \u00de, and the data were then plotted against [L]. Nonlinear regression analysis of \u0394F emission vs. [R5P] using Eq. (7) shows a hyperbolic isothermal ligand-binding curve for R5P, with a calculated K d of 24.8 \u00b5M (\u00b16.77 SE; Figure 8A). We sought to investigate what effect ATP might have on the K d for R5P; however, the inclusion of both ATP and R5P would obviously result in enzyme catalysis and the formation of pRpp and AMP. Due to the relatively high specific activity of Mt-PrsA, the addition of R5P and ATP at concentrations required for the effective measurement of ligand-binding constants by ITF would result in a reaction that would go to completion within the 5 min time-frame required to establish binding equilibrium. Therefore, due to the stability of the imidodiphophate moity and lack of enzyme-catalyzed phosphate transfer, we used the ATP analog 5'-adenylyl-\u03b2,\u03b3-imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP) as an ATP ligand substitute for binding assays, when carried out in conjunction with R5P. Mt-PrsA was titrated with increasing [AMPPNP] using identical increments carried out during ATP ligand-binding experiments.

Since ATP and ADP bind to Mt-PrsA at separate sites and induce very different aggregation states, the apparent 2-fold difference in the F max recorded for ATP and ADP is most likely due to the differing effects each of these ligands have on the chemical environments surrounding the tryptophan residues providing the source of F emission in Mt-PrsA (Eriksen et al. 2000). The inclusion of ADP at two different concentrations (0.1 and 2.0 mM) in separate ITF [ATP] ligand-binding assays causes a significant increase in the apparent K d of ATP for its Mt-PrsA-binding site (K ATP d \u00bc 31:22and90:1 mM at a concentration of 0.1 and 2.0 mM ADP, respectively), clearly illustrating allosteric inhibition of Mt-PrsA-ATP complex formation ( Figure 9B). The change in the slope of the curve as a function of [ATP] in separate ITF experiments carried out at increasing ADP concentrations, clearly illustrates a reduction in the homotropic cooperative binding of ATP for Mt-PrsA, which was confirmed by calculating the resultant Hill coefficients ( Figure 9B).

            "text": "An alignment of Mt-PrsA with its related Corynebacterineae PrsA orthologs as well as other bacterial Prs homologs from Bacillus subtilis (Bs_PrsA), E. coli (Ec_PrsA) and Streptomyces coelicolor (Sc_PrsA), and the three human Prs isoforms (Human_PrsA1-3) clearly illustrate the high level of primary sequence conservation between all variants ( Figure 10). Mt-PrsA shares very high sequence identity with its Corynebacterineae counterparts (92% Mycobacterium leprae, 87% M. smegmatis and 71% C. glutamicum) and a moderate level of sequence identity with Mt-PrsA homologs in S. coleicolor (61%), E. coli (43%) and B. subtilis (43%). Interestingly, the three human Prs isoforms also share 40% sequence identity with Mt-PrsA. Both of the human type 1 and B. subtilis pRpp synthetase X-ray crystal structures have been solved (Eriksen et al. 2000;Li et al. 2007). Each of these structures was solved in the Apo form and in complex with AMP, which is located in the ATP-binding pocket of the active site. Interestingly, the Bs-PrsA structure was solved in complex with an additional molecule of ADP, thus revealing its position and mode of action in the allosteric regulatory site of the enzyme (Eriksen et al. 2000). Since Mt-PrsA shares highest sequence homology with Bs-PrsA, we constructed a homology model of Mt-PrsA using the structure of Bs-Prs in complex with AMP and ADP as a template (Eriksen et al. 2000; Figure 11). Using crystallographic symmetry data from the Bs-Prs structure, we arranged the Mt-PrsA homology model into its hexameric form ( Figure 11A). Each monomer is composed of two subunits, which is related by a 3-fold axis perpendicular to an additional 2-fold planar rotational symmetry. Many of the residues involved in binding at the interface between monomers are well conserved, with notable differences highlighted by the position of red spheres in Figure 11A. With only a few exceptions, the sequence alignment of Mt-PrsA and Bs-Prs indicates that most of the residues involved in enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation are conserved which, in turn, are suitably positioned in the Mt-PrsA homology model compared with Bs-Prs. A noteworthy difference in the Mt-PrsA catalytic site is the presence of Asn45, which is arranged to form contacts with the ADP ligand ( Figure 11B). In the Bs-Prs structure, the equivalent residue is Asp42. In addition, further comparison of the two structures suggests that the Mt-PrsA homology model retains all of the important residues required for the regulatory site, apart from Gly88 (Ala85 in Bs-Prs), which participates in the formation of contacts to ADP with a neighboring Ser89 ( Figure 11B). An interesting observation in the model of Mt-PrsA is the presence of His109 in the \"flexible loop\" formed by Mt-PrsA residues Lys108-Arg112. Ala106 is the equivalent residue in Bs-Prs, and it appears to play little if no part in binding or coordination of the ADP ligand. This flexible loop region, which contains many conserved residues (Figure 10), has been identified as displaying some of the largest variation in backbone conformation, and the conformational changes that occur upon substrate binding are considered to be important for catalysis (Eriksen et al. 2000). The presence of a His residue in the Mt-PrsA flexible loop region might allow for multiple hydrogen bonding opportunities between His109 and the ATP substrate in the catalytic site ( Figure 11B). Gly111 is another conserved residue located in the flexible loop of mycobacterial PrsA enzymes, which in the majority of other bacterial homologs is typically replaced by a Ser that makes H-bond interactions with the \u03b1-phosphate of ADP in the allosteric site ( Figure 11C). Both the Human-PrsA1 and the Bs-PrsA homodimers are stabilized by a salt bridge at the N-terminal interface formed between two conserved residues (Asn114 and Asp139, and Asn120 and Asp145, respectively) (Eriksen et al. 2000;Li et al. 2007). From the sequence alignment and the Mt-PrsA homology model, it is worth noting that the equivalent Asn residue is replaced by an aspartic acid (Asp122) which would sit in close proximity to Asp147. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that unlike Human-PrsA1 and Bs-PrsA, a salt bridge does not occur at the Mt-PrsA dimer interface. Interestingly, the Human-PrsA1 Asn114 (Asp122 in Mt-PrsA) is often mutated to a Ser in the cells of patients suffering from gout (Becker et al. 1995). It has been reported that the molecular mechanism behind the 50% increase in N114S mutant enzyme activity is caused by a disruption of a salt bridge, which would otherwise stabilizes the dimer interface (Liu et al. 2009).",

Whilst the utilization of D-arabinopyranose seems to be confined to glycoconjugate formation in trypanosomatid parasites (Turnock and Ferguson 2007), arabinose in the furanose configuration (Araf ) is exclusively used by bacteria in the formation of cell surface polysaccharides and the biosynthesis of glycolipid antigens. Members belonging to the Corynebacterineae, such as M. tuberculosis and C. glutamicum, contain large quantities of Araf in the form of arabinan, which in turn, is covalently attached to galactan and mannan, thus forming AG and LAM, respectively. Whilst LAM exerts its biological activity by subverting the host immune response, the primary function of AG is to provide a highly branched molecular scaffold, linking the murein sacculus to the hydrophobic mycolate layer. Since arabinan is an essential component of the TB cell wall and is targeted by treatment with EMB, other enzymes involved in its formation might present themselves as potential putative drug targets.

In addition, DprE1 (Rv3790) has been shown to be the molecular target of benzothiazinones, a new class of antimycobacterial agents, which can effectively kill MDR and XDR strains of TB by blocking the C2-OH epimerization of DPR to DPA (Makarov et al. 2009). Some of the current front line drugs used to treat TB include cell wall inhibitors. However, the incidence of MDR and XDR-TB cases is alarmingly high and continues to rise (Madariaga et al. 2008). Since the M. tuberculosis cell wall is a valid drug target, we must continue to investigate the physiology, biochemistry and metabolic pathways involved in its assembly to assist our efforts of developing new anti-TB therapies. However, nondividing drug-tolerant populations of \"persistent\" TB bacilli fail to be eradicated from the host, giving rise to a latent infection as a result of subsequent granuloma formation (Barry et al. 2009). Inhibition of the cell wall biosynthetic processes of TB bacilli responsible for latent infections is of no consequence, this being due to the fact that persistent TB bacilli are not undergoing active cell growth and division. However, these \"dormant\" TB bacilli still require a basal level of \"energy\" metabolites in order to maintain critical cellular functions (Koul et al. 2008).",

            "text": "pRpp is a central metabolite ubiquitous in nature providing a high-energy substrate for the biosynthesis of histidine, tryphophan, NAD, NADP and both the de novo and the salvage pathways involved in nucleoside metabolism (Hove-Jensen 1988; Figure 1). In addition to these central metabolic processes, the Corynebacterineae have evolved a unique pathway in which pRpp is siphoned into cell wall arabinan biosynthesis ( Figure 1). In M. tuberculosis, Mt-PrsA is entirely responsible for the provision of pRpp and its cellular function bridges five different metabolic pathways (Figure 1). The omphalic nature of Mt-PrsA places a heavy burden on its biological function, especially during cell growth and division, when the cellular requirement for pRpp increases significantly. In this study, we describe the biochemical characterization of Mt-PrsA, which displays the highest recorded specific activity for a pRpp synthetase of 530 \u00b5mol \u22121 min \u22121 mg \u22121 . The K m for R5P was calculated to be in the submicromolar range of 8.2 \u00b5M, suggesting a rapid enzyme turnover with a calculated specificity constant (K cat /K m ) of 7.4 \u00d7 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 . This relatively high efficiency of Mt-PrsA fits well with the physiological function of the enzyme during cell wall biosynthesis, considering the increased demand for pRpp that is required for antecedent DPA biosynthesis. Mt-PrsA displays clear homotropic cooperativity for ATP, with an apparent S 0.5 62.65 \u00b5M, which is extremely low considering the intracellular concentration of ATP is considered to be between 3 and 5 mM. The homology model generated for Mt-PrsA contains many structural features of other pRpp synthetases that have been solved to date. The majority of the active site residues modeled in Mt-PrsA are conserved with those from other Mt-PrsA homologs, and it appears that the appropriate configuration of amino acid side chains compares well with the B. subtilis structure. This is also the case for the regulatory site in which ADP binds to allosterically modulate the enzyme. However, an interesting observation is the presence of His109 in the flexible loop region of Mt-PrsA, a residue exclusively conserved within members of the Corynebacterineae. Considering the close proximity of His109 to both the catalytic and the regulatory sites of Mt-PrsA, and its potential to make direct contacts with both ATP and ADP ligands, the presence of this conserved His in the flexible region of mycobacterial pRpp synthetases might provide some explanation for the relatively high K cat . pRpp synthetase superactivity is observed in human type-1 N114S mutants (Becker et al. 1995). This increase in activity is a result of the loss of a salt bridge formed between two monomers which induces small but significant changes to the catalytic and regulatory sites of the enzyme (Liu et al. 2009). Interestingly, the homology model of Mt-PrsA suggests that a salt bridge between the equivalent residues does not occur thus reducing the stability of the dimer interface. In mycobacteria, the biosynthesis of pRpp is required at a rate which is sufficient to not only supply central metabolic processes, such as de novo nucleoside biosynthesis, but also at a necessary level to meet the increased demands for pRpp during cell wall biosynthesis (Scherman et al. 1995(Scherman et al. , 1996. It seems plausible that pRpp synthetases from Corynebacterineae species have evolved a highly efficient version of the enzyme to account for the increased metabolic flux of pRpp, during various physiological states. pRpp synthetases in other organisms undergo stringent control by virtue of allosteric modulation from ADP. In this regard, Mt-PrsA also appears to be no different, displaying clear inhibition of enzyme activity between 0.5 and 2.0 mM ADP. When taken together, the data relating to ADP inhibition and the subsequent complex formation with Mt-PrsA suggest that the mechanism employed for the allosteric regulation of Mt-PrsA by ADP is through the formation of an Mt-PrsA hexamer (Arnvig et al. 1990). This net increase in Mt-PrsA hexamer oligomerization suggests that the efficacy of ATP for its Mt-PrsA catalytic site decreases, as a consequence of ADP allosteric modulation. The three human PrsA isoforms share a very high sequence identity (91-95% between all three); however, the subtle differences that do occur appear in the regions of the enzyme that are important for catalysis and allosteric regulation. Inhibition studies using two aminopyrimidopyrimidine nucleotide analogs 4-methoxy-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylamino)-pyrimido-[5,4-d]-pyrimidine and 4-amino-8-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosylamino) -pyrimido-[5,4-d]-pyrimidine show differential levels of inhibition of human pRpp synthetases (Fry et al. 1995). Carbocyclic analogs of R5P are another class of compounds that show differential inhibition when tested against Salmonella typhimurium, B. subtilis and human pRpp synthetases (Parry et al. 1996). In this regard, the development of a similar library of compounds targeted for the specific inhibition of Mt-PrsA might warrant further investigation. Understanding the metabolic pathways that are essential for persistent TB infections, such as mycobacterial energy metabolism, in combination with pathways involved in cell wall assembly seems a plausible strategy for the development of new antimycobacterial drugs.",

The column was washed with 2 mL of CH 3 CH 2 OH and the eluate collected, dried and partitioned between the two phases arising from a mixture of n-butanol (3 mL) and water (3 mL). The resulting organic phase was recovered following centrifugation at 3500 \u00d7 g and the aqueous phase again extracted twice with 3 mL of water-saturated n-butanol. The pooled extracts were back-washed twice with n-butanol-saturated water (3 mL). The n-butanol fraction was dried and resuspended in 200 \u00b5L of butanol. The extracted radiolabeled material was quantified by liquid scintillation counting using 10% of the labeled material and 5 mL of EcoScintA (National Diagnostics, Atlanta).
