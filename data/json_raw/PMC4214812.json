Immediately after political changes in 1991, the Government initiated a program for health care reforms by adopting new Health Care Law and establishing a single, centralized Health Insurance Fund within the newly created Ministry of Health (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20). Ministry of Health asked the World Bank for assistance for further implementation of the reform, and Macedonia became a member of the World Bank in December 1993. In 1996, a comprehensive health care reform was undertaken when the World Bank awarded the Ministry of Health a loan of US$19.4 million in order to achieve universal access to high quality health care through developing a capitation plan for primary health care (PHC) providers and concept of family medicine in PHC, as well as to establish cost effective finance and delivery systems (16,17). The Health Insurance Law was adopted in March 2000 and the Health Insurance Fund (HIF) was established as an independent institution outside of the Ministry of Health. PHC reform has increased patient choice through patient enrolment and capitation-based payment to physicians. The capitation is calculated on the basis of numbers of insured persons that have chosen a certain physician as their own primary care physician, the determined number of points for each category of population group and the determined value of each point. Additional incentive is provided for physicians' practices that are located in remote rural areas.",

In addition, HIF promoted some incentive measures for doctors and teams during the first 18 months of their practice and, especially for doctors practicing in rural areas. Introducing electronic diary, electronic health card and abolishing health books by replacing them with electronic health record at the PHC level was promoted as project entitled \"Less administration-more time for patients\". HIF announced to start a campaign to promote health in cooperation with all stakeholders in the health system and non-governmental organizations which aims to raise awareness about certain good habits such as proper diet, physical exercise and healthy lifestyle, and to combat harmful habits (smoking, overweight etc.) and their impact on health (20).",

Example of the most common diseases, quality of care, the number of health facilities and the number of doctors who are located in a particular area of the country compared to the rest of the region. The number of health facilities in the area would have to be reduced to the norms of the European Union as in Croatia and Slovenia. The biggest stumbling block is the funding and low gross national income. Terms of payment, insurance and levels of health care have to be in accordance with European standards and thus to economic development of the country to improve health care. Number of family medicine doctor must be increased and provide an incentive for choosing specialization in family medicine. The introduction of new technologies to diagnose diseases is necessary to promptly diagnose the disease and reduce the inflow of patients to secondary and tertiary levels of health care. In this way the savings in the budget will be increased. The modernization of information systems and connectivity in a single whole would reduce the number of patients waiting as well as the issuance of findings. Prevention of diseases that are most common is the most important item, since chronic disease are one of the major problems of family medicine. Networking of doctors and pharmacies will facilitate prescribing a sufficient number of recipes would improve the management of chronic diseases. Education of patients suffering from chronic diseases is very important because the proper lifestyle can reduce the consumption of medications and thus lead to a decrease in cost. The 24 hours operation at the level of family medicine would lead to a reduction in spending on secondary and tertiary levels and significantly improve the level of health care and citizen satisfaction .",
