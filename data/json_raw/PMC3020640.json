This nucleoprotein 'cap' has at least two functions: to shield the telomeric DNA from stimulating the DNA damage response (DDR) and to regulate elongation of the telomere by telomerase. In human senescent cells, dysfunctional telomeres induce a sustained DDR (d'Adda di Fagagna et al, 2003). In both budding yeast and mice, nuclease activities that attack dysfunctional telomeres contribute to telomere-driven senescence (Maringele and Lydall, 2004;Schaetzlein et al, 2007). Therefore, understanding the regulation of nuclease activities at dysfunctional telomeres in yeast is likely to be informative about similar processes occurring at mammalian telomeres and the human ageing process.",

In budding yeast, telomeric ssDNA is bound by Cdc13 with accessory proteins Stn1 and Ten1, whereas in human cells, it is bound by POT1 (de Lange, 2005;Gao et al, 2007). Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 forms an evolutionarily conserved complex (the CST complex) that has telomeric roles in most organisms studied so far (Miyake et al, 2009;Surovtseva et al, 2009). POT1 binds telomeric ssDNA and is connected to the dsDNA-binding proteins of the telomere cap by TPP1 and TIN2 (de Lange, 2009). Inactivation of POT1 or Cdc13 induces 'telomere uncapping' and has similar consequences-initiation of a DDR and resection of the telomeric DNA by nuclease activities (Garvik et al, 1995;Baumann and Cech, 2001;Pitt and Cooper, 2010).",

Following Cdc13 inactivation, a potent DDR is initiated; telomeric DNA is resected by nucleases, which degrade the AC (5 0 ) strand to generate extensive TG (3 0 ) ssDNA that stimulates activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, in a manner analogous to that at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) ( Figure 1A) (Garvik et al, 1995;Lydall and Weinert, 1995;Vodenicharov and Wellinger, 2006). There is relatively little understanding of the nuclease activities responsible for generating ssDNA at uncapped telomeres (Zubko et al, 2004). In contrast, there has been much recent progress identifying nuclease activities that function at DSBs (Gravel et al, 2008;Mimitou and Symington, 2008;Zhu et al, 2008).",

Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that Pif1 and Exo1 are required for different nuclease activities that generate ssDNA and activate the DNA damage checkpoint following Cdc13 inactivation. Furthermore, deletion of both PIF1 and EXO1 permits yeast cells to tolerate complete loss of the essential telomere capping protein Cdc13.",

We used the BioGRID database to create a ranked list of genes  Figure 1 Pif1 and Exo1 inhibit growth of cdc13-1 mutants. (A) Inactivation of Cdc13 by use of the temperature-sensitive allele cdc13-1 leads to telomere uncapping. Exo1 and additional nuclease(s) generate ssDNA at uncapped telomeres, which is the stimulus for Mec1-dependent checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest.

In this and other figures, strain numbers (DLYs) are shown adjacent. that had similar genetic interactions to EXO1 ( Figure 1B)  (Stark et al, 2006). Of these, 9/19 affected cdc13-1 growth or telomere length. Deletion of EXO1 suppresses cdc13-1 growth defects, so we focussed on those genes that also suppressed cdc13-1 growth defects. By these criteria, two previously characterized checkpoint genes (RAD9 and RAD24) and the helicase-encoding PIF1 behaved similarly to EXO1 ( Figure 1B). Rad9 and Rad24 do indeed regulate nuclease activities at uncapped telomeres and are required for checkpoint activation (Garvik et al, 1995;Lydall and Weinert, 1995;Zubko et al, 2004). Pif1 has been shown to inhibit growth of cdc13-1 mutants (Downey et al, 2006), whereas overexpression of Pif1 has been shown to enhance growth defects seen in cdc13-1 mutants, but the contribution of Pif1 to the nuclease activity and checkpoint activation in cdc13-1 mutants had not been assessed (Vega et al, 2007;Chang et al, 2009).",

            "text": "Pif1 is a helicase with both mitochondrial and nuclear functions (Van Dyck et al, 1992;Schulz and Zakian, 1994). In the nucleus, Pif1 has been implicated in negative regulation of telomerase, generation of long flaps during Okazaki fragment processing, unwinding of G-quadruplexes and disassembly of stalled replication forks (Zhou et al, 2000;Boule et al, 2005;Budd et al, 2006;Chang et al, 2009;George et al, 2009;Makovets and Blackburn, 2009;Pike et al, 2009;Ribeyre et al, 2009;Zhang and Durocher, 2010). To test the hypothesis that Pif1 contributes to a nuclease activity at uncapped telomeres in cdc13-1 mutants, we compared the effects of Pif1 and Exo1 on cell growth after Cdc13-1 inactivation. At the permissive temperature (231C), Cdc13-1 is functional and efficiently caps the telomeres, permitting growth of cdc13-1 mutants. At the non-permissive temperature (361C), Cdc13-1 is completely defective and cdc13-1 mutants are unable to grow ( Figure 1A and C). At semi-permissive temperatures (25-291C), moderate Cdc13-1 inactivation occurs and growth of cdc13-1 mutants is inhibited ( Figure 1C). As previously reported, cdc13-1 pif1D and cdc13-1 exo1D mutants are able to grow at 271C, whereas cdc13-1 mutants are not ( Figure 1C) (Zubko et al, 2004;Downey et al, 2006). These effects on growth are consistent with the hypothesis that Pif1, like Exo1, contributes to nuclease activity at uncapped telomeres.",

Remarkably, at 361C, the growth of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants was barely distinguishable from that of CDC13 \u00fe exo1D pif1D mutants (Supplementary Figure S1A). We confirmed that this effect was due to the pif1D and exo1D mutations and not due to second site suppressors arising in our strains by crossing a cdc13-1 mutant able to grow at 361C, with a cdc13-1 strain and confirming that all cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D progeny could all grow at 361C (Supplementary Figure  S1B).

We hypothesized that, as with Exo1, elimination of Sgs1 or Dna2 in cells lacking Pif1 might improve the growth of cdc13-1 mutants and perhaps even permit growth at 361C. However, we found that cdc13-1 pif1D dna2D mutants grew less well than cdc13-1 pif1D mutants (Supplementary Figure S2A). We were unable to examine the effect of dna2D on the growth of cdc13-1 PIF1 \u00fe mutants, as DNA2 is an essential gene unless PIF1 is deleted (Budd et al, 2006). We also found that cdc13-1 pif1D sgs1D mutants grew slightly less well than cdc13-1 pif1D mutants and that cdc13-1 sgs1D mutants grew slightly less well than cdc13-1 mutants (Supplementary Figure S2B), consistent with other work from our laboratory (Ngo and Lydall, 2010).

To test whether elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 caused alterations in telomere structure that could explain the growth of cdc13-1 cells at 361C, we performed Southern blots to examine telomere structure, probing for Y 0 sequences ( Figure 2B), which are components of the majority of yeast telomeres (Supplementary Figure S3A and B). The Y 0 probe contained G-rich sequences and weakly cross-hybridized to telomeres that did not contain Y 0 sequences, so we also probed for TG repeat sequences to detect telomeres that lacked Y 0 elements (Supplementary Figure S4). pif1D mutants have long telomeres (Schulz and Zakian, 1994) and consistent with this, CDC13 \u00fe exo1D pif1D mutants have longer telomeres than CDC13 \u00fe EXO1 \u00fe PIF1 \u00fe strains (compare lanes 1-2, 3-4 and 7-8; Figure 2B). The telomeres of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants grown at 361C were longer than those of CDC13 \u00fe exo1D pif1D mutants grown at 231C (compare lanes 9-10 with lanes 7-8, Figure 2B) but indistinguishable from those of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants grown at 231C (compare lanes 9-10 with lanes 17-18, Figure 2B). This demonstrates that no gross alterations in telomere structure occur when cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants are grown at 361C. Furthermore, cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants are able to grow at 361C, whereas cdc13-1 pif1D mutants are not, but are indistinguishable in telomere structure (compare lanes 13-14 with lanes 17-18, Figure 2B). We conclude that alterations in telomere structure most likely do not account for the growth of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants at 361C.",

Therefore, we wanted to know whether the nuclear or mitochondrial function of Pif1 inhibited growth of cdc13-1 exo1D mutants at 361C. The pif1-m2 allele, lacking nuclear Pif1, permitted growth of cdc13-1 exo1D mutants at 361C, whereas the pif1-m1 allele, lacking mitochondrial Pif1, did not ( Figure 2C). We note that the growth of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1-m2 mutants at 361C is less than cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants ( Figure 2C). This is consistent with other reports that low levels of nuclear Pif1 activity persist in pif1-m2 mutants (Schulz and Zakian, 1994;Ribeyre et al, 2009). We also confirmed that helicase activity of Pif1 inhibited growth of cdc13-1 exo1D mutants because the pif1-hd allele, deficient in helicase activity, also permitted growth at 361C ( Figure 2C) (Zhou et al, 2000;Ribeyre et al, 2009). We conclude that nuclear, helicase-dependent activity of Pif1 inhibits growth of telomere capping-defective cdc13-1 mutants.",

All strains also harboured the cdc15-2 mutation so that any cells that overcame cdc13-1-induced metaphase arrest would arrest in late anaphase due to cdc15-2 and be unable to enter another cell cycle ( Figure 3A) (Lydall and Weinert, 1995;Zubko et al, 2004). As expected, cdc13-1 mutants accumulated at metaphase and did not pass through to anaphase ( Figure 3B and C). cdc13-1 exo1D mutants accumulated at metaphase with similar kinetics to cdc13-1 mutants but, as previously reported, a subpopulation of cdc13-1 exo1D cells escaped metaphase  Exo1 and nuclear, helicase activity of Pif1 prevent telomere maintenance following inactivation of Cdc13.

Interestingly, cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants did not accumulate in metaphase at all and passed readily through to anaphase ( Figure 3B and C). Taken together, these results show that Pif1 has no effect on metaphase arrest of cdc13-1 mutants at 361C when Exo1 is present, but it is responsible for the arrest of a subpopulation of cells when Exo1 is absent. Following inactivation of Cdc13, Mec1-dependent checkpoint activation occurs, leading to activation and hyperphosphorylaiton of the kinase Rad53 ( Figure 1A) (Sweeney et al, 2005;Morin et al, 2008). We used the synchronous cultures to examine Rad53 phosphorylation by western blot ( Figure 3A). cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 pif1D mutants exhibited strong Rad53 phosphorylation, indicated by a marked upward mobility shift of Rad53 (upper panels, Figure 3D). A reduction in Rad53 phosphorylation was seen in cdc13-1 exo1D mutants, correlating with the recovery from metaphase arrest displayed by cdc13-1 exo1D mutants following telomere uncapping ( Figure 3C and D). Interestingly, no discernable change in the mobility of Rad53 could be seen in cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants, consistent with their complete failure to arrest cell division at 361C ( Figure 3C and D). We conclude that in the absence of Pif1 and Exo1, the checkpoint kinase Rad53 is not activated after telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 mutants.",

We treated the same set of strains examined in Figure 3B-D, with bleomycin at 231C after release from G1 arrest. cdc13-1, cdc13-1 pif1D, cdc13-1 exo1D and cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants all behaved similarly, phosphorylating Rad53 and arresting at methaphase ( Figure 3E; Supplementary Figure S4).

(A) Synchronous culture experiments to examine the effect of Pif1 and Exo1 on cell cycle arrest following telomere uncapping. cdc15-2 cdc13-1 cells were synchronized in G1 using a-factor then released at 361C. Cells arrest at metaphase from telomere uncapping (cdc13-1) or at anaphase from Cdc15 inactivation (cdc15-2). Samples taken at the time points indicated were stained with DAPI and 4100 cells of each genotype scored for cell cycle position  previously reported (Maringele and Lydall, 2002;Zubko et al, 2004). Interestingly, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants, like cdc13-1 exo1D mutants showed reduced ssDNA generation in the Y 0 600 and Y 0 5000 loci following telomere uncapping. Furthermore, cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants generated no detectable ssDNA at Y 0 600 or Y 0 5000 loci following telomere uncapping ( Figure 4B and C). We confirmed that ssDNA generation occurred on the TG (3 0 ) strand due to degradation of the AC (5 0 ) strand, as we were unable to detect ssDNA on the AC strand ( Figure 4D). We conclude that Pif1, like Exo1, is important for ssDNA generation after telomere uncapping in cdc13-1 mutants and appears to regulate a nuclease activity, which functions in parallel to Exo1 at chromosome ends.",

However, at more distal, single-copy loci, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants generated less ssDNA than cdc13-1 mutants but more than exo1D cdc13-1 mutants. The higher levels of ssDNA generated further from the chromosome end in cdc13-1 pif1D mutants, in comparison with cdc13-1 exo1D mutants, most likely accounts for their sustained metaphase arrest following telomere uncapping ( Figure 3B and C). Furthermore, the ssDNA generated by cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 pif1D mutants o10 kb from the chromosome end is 41.6% (1/64) ( Figure 4E). Assuming 1 singlestranded telomere per cell is sufficient to stimulate arrest, this suggests that ssDNA extending o10 kb on one of the 64 G2 telomeres in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is sufficient to stimulate metaphase arrest ( Figure 4E) (Sandell and Zakian, 1993;Vaze et al, 2002;Zubko et al, 2004).",

Thus, we hypothesized that cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants might still generate detectable ssDNA in the TG repeats. We used synchronous cultures ( Figure 3A) and measured ssDNA by in-gel assay to measure ssDNA in the TG repeats in cdc13-1 mutants ( Figure 4F and G). cdc13-1 mutants generated large amounts of TG ssDNA at 2 and 4 h following telomere uncapping ( Figure 4F), corresponding to an approximately five-fold increase in signal compared with yku70D mutants ( Figure 4G). cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants also generated detectable ssDNA 2 h following telomere uncapping, but at a level approximately equal to that of a yku70D mutant ( Figure 4F and G). However, the ssDNA generated in cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants was transient and was no longer detectable 4 h after telomere uncapping ( Figure 4F and G). Surprisingly, cdc13-1 pif1D mutants displayed only a modest decrease in ssDNA generation in the TG repeats following telomere uncapping, whereas cdc13-1 exo1D mutants generated very little ssDNA ( Figure 4F and G). We conclude that cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants generate limited, transient ssDNA that is insufficient to stimulate checkpoint activation and that Exo1 is much more important than Pif1 for ssDNA generation in the TG repeats following telomere uncapping.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that increased levels of telomerase at the telomeres of cdc13-1 pif1D cells shields uncapped telomeres from nuclease activities (Vega et al, 2007). However, this is somewhat inconsistent with our observation that Pif1 has relatively little effect on ssDNA generation in the telomeric TG repeats, where telomerase presumably binds ( Figure 4G). Therefore, we wanted to know whether the ability of the pif1D mutation to improve the growth of cdc13-1 mutants was dependent upon the telomerase template component (TLC1) or catalytic subunit (Est2). Interestingly, we found that cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D and cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants grew better at 251C than cdc13-1 tlc1D mutants (compare rows 7-8 and 11-12 with 3-4, Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure S6). We also found that cdc13-1 est2D pif1D and cdc13-1 est2D exo1D mutants were able to grow at 251C, whereas cdc13-1 est2D mutants were not (Supplementary Figure S7). We conclude that Pif1 has a telomerase (TLC1, Est2) independent effect at uncapped telomeres. However, we note that est2D cdc13-1 and tlc1D cdc13-1 mutants grow worse than cdc13-1 mutants, demonstrating that telomerase contributes to telomere capping following inactivation of Cdc13.",

We hypothesized that Pif1 would contribute to ssDNA generation at uncapped telomeres and subsequent checkpoint activation, even in cdc13-1 mutants lacking telomerase. To test this, we measured Rad53 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure  S8A) and telomeric TG repeat ssDNA (Supplementary Figure S8B and C) in cdc13-1 and cdc13-1 tlc1D mutants, before and after telomere uncapping. In cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D pif1D mutants, there was a decrease in Rad53 phosphorylation compared with cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants (Supplementary Figure S8A). We also found that cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D and cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D pif1D mutants generated less ssDNA than cdc13-1 tlc1D and cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants, respectively, following telomere uncapping (Supplementary Figure S8B and C). We conclude that Pif1 has a contribution to ssDNA generation and checkpoint activation following telomere uncapping that is independent of telomerase. However, we note that 40% of cdc13-1 tlc1D cells were at metaphase at 231C compared with 30% of cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D cells (Supplementary Figure S8D). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that reduced ssDNA generation in cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D mutants is due to altered kinetics of accumulation at metaphase.",

            "text": "To help clarify the role of Pif1 in cdc13-1 tlc1D and cdc13-1 TLC1 \u00fe mutants, we examined the effect of Pif1 in CDC13 \u00fe tlc1D mutants. Yeast strains that cannot recruit telomerase (e.g. tlc1D) lose telomeric DNA with each cell division until the cultures senesce and lose proliferative capacity, much like mammalian fibroblasts. Senescent, telomerase-deficient yeast cultures usually recover, using telomerase-independent, recombination-dependent mechanisms of telomere maintenance, leading to clear changes in telomere structure (Lundblad and Blackburn, 1993;Teng and Zakian, 1999). Therefore, we germinated spores containing combinations of null mutations in telomerase (TLC1), PIF1 and EXO1, and assessed growth at various passages ( Figure 5B). As expected, tlc1D mutants grew well at passage 1, poorly from passages 2-5 (senescence) and grew well again from passage 7 (recovery) ( Figure 5B). tlc1D exo1D mutants showed a similar pattern of growth to tlc1D mutants but grew slightly better prior to senescence, as previously reported (passages 3 and 4, Figure 5B) (Maringele and Lydall, 2004). In contrast, tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D strains showed a rapid decline in growth from passages 2-6 (senescence) and exhibited a protracted senescence period but slowly recovered by passage 15 ( Figure 5B). We conclude that Pif1 inhibits entry into senescence and promotes recovery. Taken with the data discussed earlier, Pif1 contributes to good growth of tlc1D mutants from passage 2 onwards, yet inhibits growth of cdc13-1 mutants ( Figures 1C and 5A). In contrast, Exo1 has only a small effect on the growth of tlc1D mutants, yet inhibits growth of cdc13-1 mutants ( Figures 1C and 5A). Thus, it is likely that the relatively poor growth of cdc13-1 tlc1D pif1D compared with cdc13-1 tlc1D exo1D mutants is due to the poor growth of tlc1D pif1D mutants compared with tlc1D exo1D mutants.  Pif1 has telomerase-independent effects at telomeres. (A) A cdc13-1/CDC13 \u00fe tlc1D/TLC1 \u00fe exo1D/EXO1 \u00fe pif1D/PIF1 \u00fe diploid (DLY1628 x DLY5324) was sporulated, dissected and germinated at 231C to generate strains of the indicated genotype at 231C. These were taken from the germination plate, grown to saturation, then serially diluted across agar plates and grown at the temperatures indicated for 3 days. (B) Strains of the genotypes indicated were passaged repeatedly by restreaking at 301C for 3 days along with TLC1 \u00fe controls. At the passages indicated, strains were assayed for growth, which was then quantified (Supplementary Figure S9). Growth at each passage is given as a fraction of the growth of the relevant TLC1 \u00fe strain and the mean of two independent strains is shown. (C) At passages 1 and 15, strains assayed for growth in (B) had genomic DNA isolated and were Southern blotted with Y 0 probe, as in Figure 2B.

Telomerase-deficient survivors typically show clear alterations in telomere structure-type I survivors undergo dramatic amplification of Y 0 elements and retain short TG overhangs, whereas type II survivors show modest amplification of Y 0 elements but amplify their TG overhangs (Teng and Zakian, 1999). Therefore, we examined the telomeres of tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants. At passage 1, before entry into senescence, tlc1D, tlc1D exo1D, tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants all had short telomeres (compare lanes 1-4 with lanes 5-12, Figure 5C). At passage 15, tlc1D mutants and tlc1D exo1D mutants had amplified Y 0 elements and terminal fragments to generate type II (lanes 17-18, Figure 5D) or type I (lanes 21-22, Figure 5D) survivors. In contrast, tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants at passage 15 had shorter telomeres than at passage 1 and had undergone a reduction in Y 0 elements, but did not appear to have generated type I or type II survivor telomere structures (compare lanes 7-8 with 19-20 and lanes 11-12 with 23-24, Figure 5D). We noted that tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D mutants resembled type I survivors in that our TG probe did not detect any individual telomeres further up the gel (marked with arrows, compare lanes 7-8 with 19-20 and lanes 11-12 with 23-24, Supplementary Figure S10), indicating that all telomeres in these strains had acquired a terminal Y 0 fragment. However, the terminal fragments of tlc1D pif1D and tlc1D pif1D exo1D were even shorter than those of type I survivors and they had undergone a reduction, not an amplification in Y 0 elements, clearly distinguishing them from typical type I survivors (compares lanes 19-20, 23-24 with lanes 21-22, Figure 5D). We conclude that Pif1 is required for the generation of type I and type II survivors and that in the absence of Pif1, cells lacking telomerase can improve growth following senescence without adopting typical type I or type II survivor structures.",

We hypothesized that Cdc13-independent telomerase activity was essential for the viability of cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains. To test this, we generated diploid strains heterozygous for pif1D, exo1D, cdc13D and tlc1D mutations, containing a plasmid that carried a wild-type copy of CDC13. Diploids were sporulated and tetrad dissection was performed to generate strains containing combinations of the four deletion mutations, in addition to the wildtype copy of CDC13. These strains were diluted across agar plates either fully supplemented (YEPD), lacking uracil (\u00c0URA) or containing FOA (FOA). FOA is toxic to cells with an active uracil biosynthetic pathway so only cells able to survive in the absence of the URA3-and CDC13-containing plasmid would be able to grow. As expected, cdc13D TLC1 \u00fe and cdc13D tlc1D mutants were able to grow on YEPD and -URA, but not on FOA medium, demonstrating that CDC13 was essential for survival of these cell types ( Figure 6B). cdc13D TLC1 \u00fe exo1D pif1D strains were able to grow on FOA, YEPD and -URA, demonstrating that CDC13 was not essential in this background ( Figure 6B). However, cdc13D TLC1 \u00fe exo1D pif1D cells grew much more poorly on FOA than on -URA and YEPD consistent the poor growth of cdc13D exo1D pif1D cells on the tetrad dissection plate(s) ( Figure 6A). Importantly, cdc13D tlc1D exo1D pif1D cells were able to grow on YEPD and -URA but not on FOA, demonstrating that they could not survive in the absence of Cdc13.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the growth and telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains with tlc1D and tlc1D exo1D pif1D strains. As expected, telomerasedeficient tlc1D mutants senesced and recovered ( Figure 7A) and by passage 11 they had generated type I (lane 15, Figure 7B) and type II (lane 16, Figure 7B) survivors. Interestingly, cdc13D exo1D pif1D strains showed a slight growth defect at passage 1 ( Figure 7A), consistent with the small colonies formed by cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants on the tetrad dissection plate ( Figure 6A) and the growth defect of cdc13D TLC1 \u00fe exo1D pif1D pURA3[CDC13] mutants grown on FOA ( Figure 6B). However, by passage 5 and in all subsequent passages cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants had improved in growth ( Figure 7A). The telomeres of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants were long with more variation in length, and by passage 11, the median telomere length and variance in length increased (lanes 9-12, 21-24, Figure 7B). This is consistent with previous work showing that hypomorphic alleles of Cdc13 can cause increased telomere length and variance in telomere length (Chandra et al, 2001). No clear alterations in the telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants were observed, and at passage 1, their telomeres most closely resembled those of cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants with capped telomeres, which notably do not senesce (compare lanes 2, 14 with lanes 9-12, Figure 7B). The growth and telomere structure of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants was clearly distinct from that of telomerase-deficient tlc1D exo1D pif1D mutants, which rapidly senesced and slowly recovered ( Figure 7A), while maintaining a relatively normal telomere structure (compare lanes 7-8 with lanes 19-20, Figure 7B). We conclude that cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants do not undergo senescence and maintain their telomeres for at least 11 passages (44 days). This is consistent with our notion that cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants are able to maintain telomeres in a telomerase-dependent manner, even in the absence of Cdc13.",

By in-gel assay, we found that cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants grown at 361C for 4 h (B2 population doublings with uncapped telomeres) and cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants from Passage 1 (B50 population doublings with uncapped telomeres) generated comparable levels of ssDNA in the TG repeats to a yku70D mutant ( Figure 7C and D). This was comparable to the transient level of ssDNA seen in cdc13-1 exo1D pif1D mutants 2 h after telomere uncapping, within a single cell cycle ( Figure 4G). We conclude that continued growth following telomere uncapping in exo1D pif1D mutants does not lead to ssDNA accumulation. This suggests that no residual nuclease activities continue to resect uncapped telomeres in the absence of Pif1 and Exo1.   Cells lacking Cdc13 maintain telomeres and do not senesce. (A) Strains of the genotypes indicated were passaged repeatedly at 231C for 4 days along with TLC1 \u00fe CDC13 \u00fe controls. At the passages indicated, strains were assayed for growth (Supplementary Figure S13). Growth at each passage is given as a fraction of the growth of the relevant TLC1 \u00fe CDC13 \u00fe strain. The mean of two tlc1D strains or four cdc13D strains is shown. (B) At passages 1 and 11, strains that were assayed for growth in (A) had genomic DNA isolated and were Southern blotted, as in Figure 2B. PIF1 \u00fe EXO1 \u00fe CDC13 \u00fe and exo1D pif1D cdc13-1 (TS) strains were grown independently. See Supplementary Figure S14 for original blot probed with Y 0 and TG probe. (C) CDC13 \u00fe ( \u00fe ), cdc13D (\u00c0) and cdc13-1 (TS) strains of the genotypes indicated were either grown exponentially at 23 or 361C for 4 h before their DNA was isolated and telomeric TG ssDNA was detected by in-gel assay as in Figure 4F.

We propose that close to the chromosome end (o5 kb) both Pif1-and Exo1-dependent activities generate ssDNA, causing weak initial checkpoint activation. We propose that Exo1 subsequently generates ssDNA 45 kb from the chromosome end, leading to stronger checkpoint activation that is sufficient to arrest all cells with uncapped telomeres. Our model is consistent with Pif1 being ExoY, a hypothetical nuclease proposed to function in parallel to Exo1 at uncapped telomeres (Zubko et al, 2004). Pif1, like ExoY, is more important for ssDNA generation at the end of the chromosome than further away ( Figure 4E).",

We propose that Pif1 binds and unwinds 5 0 (AC) overhangs because Pif1 is a 5 0 -3 0 helicase (Lahaye et al, 1991;Zhou et al, 2000;Pike et al, 2009). If Pif1 does engage telomeric dsDNA and convert it to ssDNA, 5 0 (AC) ssDNA presumably exists (Supplementary Figure S15A). Interestingly, 5 0 telomeric ssDNA has been observed both in mammalian cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans (Cimino-Reale et al, 2003;Raices et al, 2008) and but not so far in S. cerevisiae. However, 5 0 ssDNA overhangs could in principle occur at stalled replication fork structures (Supplementary Figure  S15B) or Okazaki fragments.",

Other work recently published from our laboratory demonstrates that Sgs1 also contributes to resection of uncapped telomeres, but elimination of Sgs1 and Exo1 is insufficient to prevent the resection of uncapped telomeres in cdc13-1 mutants (Ngo and Lydall, 2010). The work presented here demonstrates that elimination of Pif1 and Exo1 prevents resection of uncapped telomeres in cdc13-1 mutants. However, at DSBs that can be repaired by homologous recombination or at DSB-induced shortened telomeres, Pif1 has little effect on resection (Zhu et al, 2008;Bonetti et al, 2009). Interestingly, Pif1 has been shown to have a critical role repair of DSBs where break-induced replication (BIR) is the main repair pathway (Chung et al, 2010). A major challenge will be to determine which substrates are exposed at DSBs, shortened telomeres and uncapped telomeres and how nuclease activities are coordinated to process them.",

Interestingly, pif1D cells improve their growth following senescence without adopting typical survivor-like telomeric DNA structures ( Figure 5C). Usually following senescence, survivors are generated by homologous-recombination-and BIR-dependent alterations in telomere structure (Teng and Zakian, 1999;Lydeard et al, 2007). If BIR is eliminated, cells lacking telomerase senesce and undergo a complete loss in viability (Lydeard et al, 2007). The relatively unaltered telomere structure and poor growth following senescence in cells lacking Pif1 and telomerase is consistent with the impaired BIR seen in cells lacking Pif1 (Chung et al, 2010). Therefore, reduced BIR in pif1D cells may be sufficient to  Figure 8 A model for the roles of Pif1 and Exo1 in the DDR at uncapped telomeres. Following telomere uncapping, 5 0 and 3 0 ssDNA is exposed within 5 kb of the chromosome end, serving as a substrate for resection. 5 0 ssDNA is unwound by Pif1 and presumably cleaved by an unidentified ssDNA endonuclease, whereas the junction between 3 0 ssDNA and dsDNA is recognized and resected by the exonuclease Exo1. This low-level processing leads to weak checkpoint activation. Resection of 3 0 ssDNA overhangs beyond 5 kb requires Exo1. This further processing causes robust checkpoint activation. maintain comparatively normal telomere structure in telomerase-deficient cells but insufficient to permit the typical amplification of Y 0 elements or terminal TG repeats seen in survivors. The absence of telomeric repeat amplification could prevent these cells from achieving the high levels of post-senescence growth seen in other telomerase-deficient mutants.",

This is surprising because Cdc13 is considered crucial for efficient recruitment of telomerase and thus to prevent senescence (Nugent et al, 1996). We propose that in the absence of Cdc13, Yku80 binds TLC1, the telomerase RNA, to help recruit telomerase to the telomere (Peterson et al, 2001). The requirement for Rad52 for the survival of cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants is surprising. It will be interesting to investigate whether telomeric repeats from extremely long telomeres in cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants ( Figure 7B) can be distributed to shorter telomeres by homologous recombination, thus preventing short telomeres from becoming critically short. Finally, it will also be paramount to determine whether the requirement for telomerase in cdc13D exo1D pif1D mutants is a consequence of the increased utilization of telomerase that has been reported at the telomeres of cells lacking Pif1 (Boule et al, 2005).",
