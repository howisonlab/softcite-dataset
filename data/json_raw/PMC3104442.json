The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of cTnT in ESRD patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Materials and Methods: Two hundred eighty-four ESRD patients with ACS were enrolled between March 2002 and February 2008. These patients were followed until death or June 2009. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. The cutoff value of cTnT for AMI was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and potential outcome predictors were determined by Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: AMIs were diagnosed in 40 patients (14.1%). The area under the curve was 0.98 in the ROC curve (p<0.001; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00). The summation of sensitivity and specificity was highest at the initial cTnT value of 0.35 ng/mL (sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.97). Survival analysis showed a statistically significant difference in allcause and cardiovascular mortalities for the group with an initial cTnT \u22650.35 ng/ mL compared to the other groups. Initial serum cTnT concentration was an independent predictor for mortality. Conclusion: Because ESRD patients with an initial cTnT concentration \u22650.35 ng/mL have a poor prognosis, it is suggested that urgent diagnosis and treatment be indicated in dialysis patients with ACS when the initial cTnT levels are \u22650.35 ng/mL."

The third generation cTnT test uses the same monoclonal antibodies (M11.7 and M7) as the second generation test, but is standardized with human recombinant cTnT instead of bovine cTnT. The detection limit and concentration corresponding to the 10% total coefficient of variation of the assay are <0.01 and 0.03 ng/mL, respectively. The medical decision cut-off for AMI on the ROC curve was 0.1 ng/mL. 14 Serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-disease (ESRD) patients. [1][2][3][4] The death rate from cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients is 20-40 fold higher than in the general population. 5 The prevalence of coronary artery disease in ESRD patients has been reported to be as high as 73%, 6 and 72% of ESRD patients with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) do not survive 2 years. 7 Therefore, it is increasingly apparent that chronic renal dysfunction alone is an independent risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. 3 The diagnosis of AMI has traditionally relied upon the combination of chest pain, electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations, and elevations in serum biomarkers of cardiac injury. However, chest symptoms and ECG abnormalities are frequently atypical or absent in ESRD patients, which may delay diagnosis and adversely affect outcomes. 8 As a result, the diagnosis of AMI has increasingly depended upon evaluation of blood biomarkers, particularly troponins. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and I (cTnI) are cardiac regulatory proteins that control the calcium-mediated interaction of actin and myosin. Because of their increased specificity compared with creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and other markers, serum troponins are the preferred marker for diagnosis of AMI.",

In addition, all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of patients whose initial cTnT levels were \u22650.35 ng/mL were much higher than the other groups. A cTnT level of 0.1 ng/mL is currently used as the cut-off value for AMIs in the general population. In ESRD patients, however, a number of studies have reported that false positive elevations in cTnT level, even without evidence of myocardial injury, are not uncommon. [16][17][18][19] Several studies have suggested the following possible reasons for elevated cTnT without myocardial damage: left ventricular hypertrophy, endothelial dysfunction, leakage of free cytosolic troponin pool, stretch-mediated troponin release, and impaired renal excretion. [17][18][19] In this study, the summation of sensitivity and specificity of cTnT for AMI in ESRD patients with ACS peaked at 0.35 ng/mL. At a value of 0.1 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 98%, yet the specificity was only 65%. Although AMI is such a serious complication that it is important for the screening test to have high sensitivity, a 35% false positive rate cannot be ignored. Therefore, we suggest that an initial cTnT concentration of 0.35 ng/mL in ESRD patients with ACS is a more appropriate cut-off value for AMI, even though patients with lower levels of cTnT should also be carefully monitored.",

In the multivariate model, age, serum cTnT, and STEMI were independent predictors for cardiovascular mortality. In the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for cardiovascular mortality, patients with a large increase in 30-50% of asymptomatic HD patients exhibit an elevation in the CK-MB fraction. 21,22 Moreover, 18-31% of patients with an ACS have elevated cTnT levels without an increase in the CK-MB fraction. 23,24 Therefore, we performed survival analyses to confirm the validity of the ROC results. An elevation in serum cTnT levels is a well-known predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic ESRD patients. 16,[25][26][27][28] Although the reasons for the association between elevated levels of cTnT and a poor prognosis are not clear, the possibility has been suggested that patients with increased cTnT have diffuse coronary artery disease. 27,29 Increased serum troponin levels are highly prognostic for cardiac and all-cause mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease with ACS. 12,30 In the GUSTO-IV trial, elevated cTnT independently predicted the 30-day prognosis in all patients, and patients with creatinine clearance in the lowest quartile (<58 mL/min) also showed poor outcomes; 12 however, only 11 of 7,033 patients had severe renal impairment with a creatinine clearance <10 mL/min. In addition, it was reported that elevations in cTnI levels in patients with renal impairment undergoing an evaluation for myocardial ischemia were at substantially higher risk for allcause and cardiovascular mortality. 30 We identified elevated cTnT levels in ESRD patients presenting with ACS as an independent predictive factor for all-cause and cardiovascu- cTnT (\u22650.35 ng/mL) had a greater mortality rate.

Therefore, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm the findings. Second, levels of CK/CK-MB were used as serologic markers for the diagnostic criteria of AMI in this study, and the measurement of CK/CK-MB for diagnosing AMI has some known shortcomings. Of note, we excluded patients with skeletal muscle injuries and defined AMI as a temporal change of CK/CK-MB, rather than a single increased value. Third, we were unable to simultaneously measure serum cTnI levels. cTnT is more frequently elevated than cTnI among asymptomatic patients with renal insufficiency due to the relatively higher levels of an unbound cytosolic pool of cTnT and the higher molecular weight. 24 In addition, time-dependent change of cTnT could not be evaluated due to the lack of repeated measurements of cTnT levels. Finally, we could not obtain data on risk factors, such as hemodynamic status and echocardiographic features, along with medical history, such as smoking habits or family history, due to deficiencies in our database.",

            "text": "In conclusion, although moderate elevations of cTnT are common in ESRD patients without AMI, measurement of cTnT is useful for diagnosing AMI or predicting outcomes. In addition, ESRD patients with an initial cTnT concentration \u22650.35 ng/mL seem to have a poor prognosis. Therefore, we recommend that urgent diagnosis and treatment be indicated for ESRD patients with ACS when their initial cTnT levels are \u22650.35 ng/mL, due to the reasonable predictive capacity of cTnT."
