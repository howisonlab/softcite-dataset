We demonstrate that the stability of graphene paper under intense irradiation can be dramatically increased through a designed laser engineering process by forming densely packed graphitic nanospheres on the paper surface. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity is enhanced and electric conductivity is improved. The engineered graphene paper can image the invisible micro-patterns of trace amount molecules and increases the detection limit towards diverse molecules by over two orders of magnitude compared to the pristine graphene paper and commercial products in MS analysis.",

            "text": "raphene materials are rapidly attracting interest due to their unique properties and widely spread applications [1][2][3][4] . With recent advances in nanotechnology, various nano-structured materials have been used in irradiation involved area, such as sensitive analysis of molecules [5][6][7] , including graphene based nano-materials [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] . Nevertheless, graphene is not stable under strong irradiation conditions 4,[16][17][18][19][20] . For example, the in situ formation of C 60 on the surface of graphene under 80 keV electron beam irradiation was observed by Chuvilin et al. 17 , and carbon clusters with larger sizes (C n , n , 500) were also observed in the mass spectrometry (MS) spectra of graphene with high intensity during the laser desorption/ionization (LDI) process 19 , which may decrease the detection sensitivity in MS based analysis. Considering the fact that carbon clusters produced from graphene during irradiation may have lower atomic energy (,20.26 eV/atom) and thus are more stable compared to graphene 17 , we hypothesise that by introducing stable carbon species homogenously distributed on the surface in situ, engineered graphene products can meet the needs of applications designed in extreme conditions, e. g. intense irradiation.",

Despite the substantial progress, the application of MALDI MS towards small molecules is limited because the matrices (normally small organo molecules like a-cyano-4hydroxycinnamic acid, CHCA) introduce significant background signals during laser ablation in the low molecular range (,1000 Da). In addition, the large and irregular sizes of the matrix crystals (.10 mm) and sweet-spot effects limit the imaging spatial resolution and detection efficiency 5,6 . To date, overcoming the low sensitivity of MS based imaging towards small molecules and the preparation of stable functional materials under irradiation represent the key challenges to the field.",

In this study, we demonstrate that the stability of graphene paper during intense laser irradiation can be dramatically increased through a pulsed-laser engineering process by forming densely packed graphitic nanospheres (stable under 300 keV electron beam) on the paper surface. Moreover, the surface hydrophobicity is enhanced and the electric conductivity is improved. The engineered graphene paper as a substrate for matrix-free LDI MS detection and imaging helps recognize invisible stamped micro-patterns, increasing the detection limit towards diverse molecules by over two orders of magnitude compared to the pristine graphene paper and commercial products. To our knowledge, the laser engineering approach represents a novel strategy compared to previous reports where the laser treatment was used either in a different manner or for other applications (see Table S1 for more details).",

The graphene paper was obtained by vacuum filtration of the as-synthesised graphene suspension (Figure 1a and 1b). A pulsed nitrogen laser with a wavelength of 337 nm was employed to engineer the graphene paper ( Figure 1c). The laser beam scanning (,30 mm in spot diameter, 500 pulses for each spot) was programmed with the spot-to-spot distance of 30 mm in two dimensions to ensure the maximum and homogenous modification on the surface, which is also sufficient for the identification of latent fingerprints with a typical spatial resolution of 150 mm 22 . The laser energy was approximately 121.8 mJ for 100% laser intensity, which was adjusted to be 10%, 30% and 50% to study its influence on the structure and performance of engineered graphene papers (graphene paper was damaged by severe fragmentation at 80% intensity, data not shown). As shown in the digital image (Figure 1d), the engineered area of the graphene paper turns to dark black after laser treatment with 50% laser intensity. The engineered graphene paper is freestanding and highly flexible, which can be bent and twisted into large angles without breaking as displayed in the inset of Figure 1e. Consequently, the engineered graphene paper (1.5 cm 3 0.75 cm) can be easily integrated on the top of a glass slide ( Figure 1e) and used as a substrate for MS detection and imaging applications ( Figure 1f).",

            "text": "The morphology of the engineered graphene paper was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Figure 1d shows the typical SEM images of graphene paper before and after laser treatment with 50% laser intensity. The pristine graphene paper shows a relatively smooth surface. In contrast, the engineered graphene paper possesses a very rough surface with ordered concaves and convexes. The periodic concaves have a uniform distance of ,30 mm, consistent with the spot size of the laser beam. Such a rough surface may be responsible for enhanced light absorbance and diffuse reflection, leading to the dark colour of the engineered graphene paper. The contact angle (CA) of graphene paper was measured (inset of Figure 1d) and used as the quantitative indicator of changing surface hydrophobicity. The CA of the untreated graphene paper is 30u, which increases dramatically to 131u for the engineered paper, indicative of enhanced surface hydrophobicity. Due to the high surface tension, a water droplet tends to minimize the surface. Although the surface of a hydrophobic substrate is covered with an aqueous solution, the area between ridges on the rough surface may not be filled by the liquid, leading to the formation of a composite interface. As a result, air bubbles are entrapped into micro-/nano-sized pores at the solid surface, where a mix of solid-liquid and solid-gas interfaces is created. Compared to the plain graphene paper, engineered graphene paper with enhanced surface roughness increases the volume of air bubbles entrapped in the interface and the extent of solid-gas interface is proportional to the degree of hydrophobicity of the material [26][27][28] . Meanwhile, after the laser treatment, the electrical resistance of the paper is reduced from 1.5 to 0.3 kV/cm. The enhanced electrical conductivity is attributed to the elimination of oxygen atoms caused by the laser irradiation process (the oxygen atomic content reduced from 19.5% to 14.1% after laser treatment according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in Figure S2), a phenomenon consistent with previous literatures 2,3 . The changes in surface chemistry and the introduction of surface roughness at the micro-/nano-scale (see also details in Figure 2) by the laser irradiation may both contribute to the enhanced hydrophobicity of engineered graphene papers.",

Further increase of the laser intensity to 50% (Figure 2d, 2h and 3a) leads to the formation of nanospheres arrays on the surface. The surface of the engineered area is fully decorated with aligned nanospheres, which is different from the morphology of laser-engineered graphene with exfoliated layers described in the previous literatures 2,3 . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used to investigate the structure of nanospheres, where densely stacked spherical structures can be found on the edge of engineered graphene (Figure 3b). The typical graphitic interlayer spacings (,0.35 nm) can be clearly observed in the shell (inset of Figure 3b). It was reported that graphene was not stable under electron beam at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV 16,17 . In our experiments, it was noticed that the carbon nanospheres formed on the graphene surface maintained a stable structure under 300 keV electron beam, indicating enhanced stability over bare graphene paper. The engineered paper keeps its unique surface morphology even after sonication ( Figure  S4a), indicating that the in situ grown nanospheres attach firmly to the surface ( Figure S4b) and the engineered paper is robust for further applications.

As shown in Figure 2i and 2j, both the untreated and mildly engineered (with 10% laser intensity) graphene papers produced a large number of fragments from the carbon clusters with signal intensity up to 75,000. In the case of engineered paper with 30% laser intensity (Figure 2k), the fragments can still be observed but with a decreased signal intensity (12,000). The engineered paper with 50% laser intensity produces fragments with significantly lower signal intensity (, 2,000, Figure 2l).

As shown in Figure 2m-p, all the graphene papers show characteristic peaks for the D, G bands. The I(D)/I(G) ratio is 1.42 for the pristine graphene paper (Figure 2m), which slightly increases to 1.62 ( Figure 2n) after irradiated with laser intensity of 10%. The stacked graphene sheets in the pristine paper are slightly damaged and exfoliated (Figure 2b and 2f); as a result, more lattice defects are created and more dangling bonds are exposed, leading to a higher I(D)/I(G) ratio 29,30 . When the laser intensity is increased to 30% and 50%, the I(D)/I(G) ratio is reduced to 0.99 and 0.81, respectively (Figure 2o and 2p), suggesting that the number of lattice defects is decreased with the increase in irradiation energy. It has been reported that carbon atoms at the defect sites are less stable than those located at regular carbon positions 14,15 . With the reduction in the number of defect carbon atoms and the formation of nanospheres with the increased laser intensity, the stability of engineered graphene paper against further fragmentation can be enhanced.",

The performance of the engineered graphene paper is compared with a commercial product, NALDI TM plate (Bruker) 23 , for matrix free MS analysis of a small dye molecule acridine orange 10-nonyl bromide (AONB). In the case of the NALDI TM plate, only weak signals of AONB (8.5 fmol) at m/z of 392 [C 26 H 38 BrN 3 -Br] 1 were observed with signal strength less than 1000 (Figure 4a), whereas on the engineered graphene paper the molecular ion peak was observed with signal strength over 100,000 (Figure 4b), ,100 times stronger compared with that observed on the commercial plate. When the amount of AONB is decreased to less than 1 fmol (0.85 fmol), the analyte signal failed to be identified on the commercial NALDI TM plate ( Figure S5a), but was clearly observed on the engineered graphene paper ( Figure S5b). It is noted that in control experiments with CHCA used as matrix, weak signals of AONB (8.5 fmol, Figure S6a) can be viewed in the presence of strong CHCA interference peaks and detection fails with decreased AONB amount (0.85 fmol, Figure S6b). It is concluded that the engineered graphene paper has superior performance compared to the commercial product for advanced matrix-free MS applications.",

The engineered graphene paper was also successfully applied to the matrix-free detection of two phosphorous lipids (dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline, DPPC, and hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine, HSPC) and the detection of limit reached femtomolar level ( Figure S8).

A dilute solution of DOTAP (1.4 pmol/mL) was used as invisible 'ink' for stamping. The stamp was dipped into the solution and then pressed onto the graphene paper to mark the pattern of letters, which is invisible on the stamped paper ( Figure S9) and can only be subsequently constructed by 2D matrix-free MS imaging technique (see Methods for details). As indicated in Figure 3d, the signals of DOTAP at m/z of 662 and 380 are monitored and shown in red and green, respectively. The pixel size is 50 mm by 50 mm to distinguish the finest width of letters in the stamp. In the case of un-modified graphene paper, the pattern of stamp is non-resolved and difficult to fully image ('N' in Figure 4e & f, 'A' and 'B' in Figure S10a, b, e, f). In contrast, when the engineered graphene paper is used as the substrate, the pattern of the letters is clear and fully resolved (Figure 4g & h, Figure S10c, d, g, h). It is noted that due to the low concentration (,pmol/mL) and detection of limit (,fmol) for detection and imaging achieved in our study, the engineered graphene paper can be applied not only with tissue blotting for small metabolites and lipids molecules 8,[22][23][24][25] , but also used in the forensic study to track trace amount of chemicals (normal concentration ,nmol/ mL, such as drugs) in the latent fingerprint 1,2,9 and record/monitor the invisible micro-pattern of specific molecules.",

The enhanced stability of engineered graphene paper due to decreased defects and the formation of stable graphitic nanosphere arrays effectively prevent the substrate material from unwanted fragmentation and laser energy loss, leading to the ultrahigh ionization/detection efficiency and improved detection sensitivity. Meanwhile, the enhanced surface hydrophobicity can provide strengthened hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic analyte molecules (such as lipids in our case), favourable for the laser energy transfer to the lipid molecules and for laser induced desorption process 18,31 . The improved electrical conductivity is also beneficial during the LDI process, providing improved electron mobility on the substrate surface for better analyte ionization. Most importantly, the carefully adjusted laser engineering parameters create a homogeneous functional surface, which is crucial for the reliable and highresolution replication of invisible micro-pattern of low concentration analytes.",

In the laser engineering of the obtained graphene paper, the pulsed nitrogen laser with wavelength of 337 nm (200 Hz) was used in the Bruker Autoflex III MS chamber and the paper was loaded on the MALDI plate for further engineering. The imaging mode was employed for the laser engineering, where the spot-to-spot distance is set to be 30 mm and 500 shots were taken at each spot. The laser power was about 121.8 mJ for 100% laser intensity 14 . The laser intensity was set to be 10%, 30% and 50% to get different engineered graphene paper. The engineered paper was tailored into different shapes for mass spectrometry detection and imaging. The SEM images were taken on the JSM-7800F Thermal Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope, the samples were loaded on the carbon adhesive and baked overnight at 70uC before SEM analysis without coating of gold or platinum. Contact angle measurement was performed by Dataphysics OCA 20-sessible/pendant drop measurement, where 5 mL of water droplet was placed on the substrate paper. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed on the Kratos Axis Ultra photoelectron spectrometer which used Al K a (1253.6 eV) X-rays. The electrical resistance of paper was measured using the CM2700 device from the CALTEK instrument. TEM images were taken with a JEOL 2011 microscope operated at 300 kV. The LDI MS spectra of the paper were collected at the laser intensity of 36%, where 500 shoots were taken at 10 spots (50 shots for each spot).

The lipid molecules were initially dissolved in chloroform and ethanol was used for AONB at a concentration of 1 mg/ mL and then diluted in a step wise manner. To perform to MS detection, typically 0.4 mL of the diluted solution was directly deposited on the paper or NALDI TM plate (Bruker Daltonics), for MS analysis on Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III Smartbeam. For the standard matrix assisted detection, 0.4 mL of sample solution was mixed with 1 mL of CHCA matrix (10 mg/mL, in acetonitrile/water/trifluoroacetic acid, 50549.950.1%, v/v/v) and dried on the commercial MALDI plate (MPT 384 plain steel) before MS analysis. All mass spectra were obtained in the RP-HPC-Proteomics mode via an accumulation of 500 laser shots under a laser intensity of 36% for data collection and calibrated using an auto calibration method. Two standard peptides, Angiotensin II (M.W. 1046.5) and ACTH-Clip (M.W. 2465.7), were used for calibration to reduce variability. No smoothing of spectra was applied. In the imaging experiments, the stamp with laser engraved letters pattern was first fabricated and immersed into a DOTAP solution at a concentration of 1 ng/mL. The stamp was pressed to the paper substrate separately and then the stamped paper was loaded into the MS chamber for imaging. Matrix-free mass spectrometry imaging was performed on the Bruker Autoflex TOF/TOF III mass analyzer system in positive reflector mode. In the imaging set up, the spot-to-spot distance was set to be 50 mm and 50 laser shots were taken with laser intensity of 36% at each spot. The nitrogen laser (337 nm) was applied at a repetition rate of 200 Hz. A full mass spectrum ranging from 200 to 2000 m/z was acquired for every pixel at an x-y step-size of 50 mm. Imaging data was stored in the FlexImaging data format (Bruker Bioscience). 2D image construction and statistical analysis were executed using custom-made scripts in the FlexImaging software (Bruker Biosicence, AUS).
