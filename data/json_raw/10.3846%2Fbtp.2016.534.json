It is often based on vague, inconsistent, partially subjective data (knowledge) items of interdisciplinary nature. For this reason, in risk management used different approaches, techniques and tools, both traditional and advanced. For example expert method, brainstorming, simulation, fuzzy sets, e.g. methods of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy logic. The authors Banaitiene et al. present a research in area of construction projects. The aim of the research is to discover how construction companies perceive the significance of the construction projects risks they face and the extent to which they employ potential risk responses (Banaitiene et al. 2011).

When the value of the output variable is evaluated in the interval from 40 to 60, then the output linguistic value is Middle value of the total project risk. When the value of the output variable is evaluated in the interval from 60 to 80, then the output linguistic value is Low value of the total project risk.

Individual characteristics associated with the process of project management, although the project practice countable relatively well, but usually only with large variance. This means that they are more or less well estimated. The current approach eg. In the field of risk engineering applied either numerical values of probability and impact, or worked with classical sharp jurisdiction of these values into certain sets, which for many applications not appropriate and did not correspond to the actual perception of risk. Fuzzy approach to modeling these processes minimizes this shortcoming. Application of fuzzy modeling approach controversial (in relation to the possibilities and practical usability exact calculation) selected project processes is one of the major contributions of this paper."

This phase evaluates the total project risk based on two parameters: the number of sub-risks and the total value of sub risk. For creating of model is used fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic. The advantage of fuzzy sets in comparison with the classical set theory is its ability to record inaccurate (vague) concepts that project managers use natural language in the design and implementation of projects."

With this approach it is possible to simulate an uncertainty that is always associated with projects. After the fuzzy model is constructed, it is necessary to tune it (to set up the inputs on known values, evaluate the results and to change the rules or weights, if necessary) when the model was built. If the fuzzy model is tuned, it is possible to use it in practice. For implement the fuzzy model in MATLAB can also created an executable file called M-File. M-file is used to enter the input values and automatically evaluate the total risk of the project."
