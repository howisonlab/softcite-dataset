It is often based on vague, inconsistent, partially subjective data (knowledge) items of interdisciplinary nature. For this reason, in risk management used different approaches, techniques and tools, both traditional and advanced. For example expert method, brainstorming, simulation, fuzzy sets, e.g. methods of fuzzy numbers and fuzzy logic. The authors Banaitiene et al. present a research in area of construction projects. The aim of the research is to discover how construction companies perceive the significance of the construction projects risks they face and the extent to which they employ potential risk responses (Banaitiene et al. 2011).
