The study aimed to compare BM risk after erlotinib administration and chemotherapy in stage IIIB/IV pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. Patients and methods: Eligible patients underwent match pair process with matching factors, including age, sex, performance status score, first-line or second-line treatment, first-line chemotherapy regimen (for the second-line treatment subgroup), stage IIIB or IV, and genotypes of EGFR mutation. BM and mortality risk of both groups were recorded and compared. Results: In total 129 matched pairs were included for analysis. During a median follow-up of 21.5 months, time to BM risk was longer and incidences of BM within 2 years were lower in patients who received erlotinib than chemotherapy in total population, as well as subgroups of first-line treatment, second-line treatment, stage IIIB, stage IV, exon 19 deletion mutation, and exon 21 L858R mutation. Similar overall survival time and 2-year survival rates were seen in two groups totally or in any subgroup. Multivariate analysis showed that BM was retarded in patients who received erlotinib administration (hazard ratio, 1.695; P=0.001) and in patients who were in stage IIIB (hazard ratio, 1.751; P=0.001). Conclusion: Erlotinib administration decreases BM risk in advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients harboring sensitive EGFR mutations.",

            "text": "In the era of molecular targeted therapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)mutant lung cancer has been labeled as a specific subset of disease, demonstrating distinct clinical and biological features. Recent studies 4,5 showed that patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC were prone to develop BM than patients with wild EGFR. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib, are associated with a high response rate of up to 80% to EGFR-mutant lung cancer. 6 In addition, it may penetrate through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) more efficiently [7][8][9][10] than large chemotherapeutic molecules. 11,12 However, few studies have been conducted to examine the impact of upfront EGFR-targeted therapy versus conventional chemotherapy on BM risk in NSCLC patients with sensitive EGFR mutation. In prospective, randomized, and controlled trails, 13,14 comparing erlotinib or gefitinib with chemotherapy for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, the differences in BM risk between two groups were not reported. A retrospective study 15 exploring the effect of first-line EGFR-TKI versus conventional chemotherapy on risk of metastasis to the central nervous system (CNS) in stage IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients showed a lower cumulative risk of CNS metastasis after first-line EGFR-TKI treatment (77 patients) compared with the chemotherapy treatment (42 patients) (P=0.032). Nevertheless, the aforementioned data should be interpreted rigorously due to the small sample size, lack of survival information, and retrospective analysis in nature. Therefore, we retrieved clinical materials and survival data of stage IIIB/IV EGFR-mutant pulmonary adenocarcinoma, comparing BM risk and survival in matched pair patients who had been administered with erlotinib or chemotherapy.",

Present study showed prolonged time to BM and a lowered 2-year cumulative risk of BM development in patients receiving erlotinib than chemotherapy. The cause-specific HR for erlotinib versus chemotherapy was 1.695, suggesting an increased risk of 69.5% for chemotherapy than erlotinib. Thus, the observed lower BM incidence seems to be due, at least in part, to the effect of the EGFR TKI. The promising effect of erlotinib was also seen in subgroups of patients with first-line treatment, second-line treatment, stage IIIB disease, stage IV disease, exon 19 deletion mutation, and L858R mutation in exon 21. For patients administrated with erlotinib, CR/PR of extracranial disease predicted lower BM risk than effect evaluation of SD. Cisplatin/pemetrexed and carboplatin/paclitaxel applied in first-line treatment resulted similar BM risks in patients of the second-line treatment group. When considered for OS, no statistical significances were seen between the erlotinib and the chemotherapy groups or in any subgroup. Existed studies 17,18 showed potential better prognostic values in patients harboring exon 19 deletion mutation compared with patients with L858R mutation. In our analysis, similar survival outcomes were found between both EGFR mutations. During follow-up, approximately two-thirds of patients who suffered from BM received subsequent WBRT or SRS, either alone or combined with EGFR TKI or systemic chemotherapy. Objective response rates were .50%, which was similar to previous studies. 19 In addition, erlotinib provided significant improvement in quality of life compared with chemotherapy in terms of simple PS score. In consistent with existed reports, toxicities of erlotinib were exhibited as rash, diarrhea, etc, which were milder in severity and easier to be controlled when compared with chemotherapy.",

Although BM occurrence largely shortened the survival of patients, subsequent treatments, including radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, and anti-EGFR treatment, succeeded in controlling BM to a certain extent. Disease progression in local disease and distant metastases other than brain also account for the balanced survival between two groups. Additionally, several randomized studies 13,[22][23][24] demonstrated that the first-line EGFR TKI resulted significant improvement in both disease response to treatment and progression-free survival than conventional platinum-based combined chemotherapy, but not in OS. The rather high proportion of patients in the chemotherapy arm crossing over to the EGFR TKI arm during disease progression provided the interpretation. Similarly in our study, 79 patients from the chemotherapy group took EGFR TKI orally after BM occurrence. The crossing over to erlotinib treatments makes the survival benefit not significant enough to be analyzed in statistics. Furthermore, for some patients in our study who died without BM occurrence, the 6.0-month time interval between median time to BM and median OS was shorter than the survival time after BM occurrence.",

First, although our study used a match pairing procedure to reduce the effect of several variables on the outcomes, the retrospective single-center nonrandomized design weakened the persuasion when interpreting the results. Therefore, comparisons were carried out in subgroups of stage IIIB, stage IV, first-line and second-line treatments, and different EGFR mutations, which broadened the potential benefit population, thus helped to explore the best benefit population and best time point for erlotinib administration. Second, due to the 6-year long time span of our study, majority patients in the chemotherapy group did not undergo EGFR mutation screening at initial diagnosis because of underestimating its importance. Currently, EGFR mutation genotype is routinely determined in pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, for lung cancer patients with BM, highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction techniques provide the feasibility of determination of EGFR mutation genotype in BM, 25 which provides detail biological information of BM and thus guide treatment decisions in clinical practice.",
