            "text": "To identify genes involved in the response to the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora in apple (Malus3domestica), expression profiles were investigated using an apple oligo (70-mer) array representing 40, 000 genes. Blossoms of a fire blight-susceptible apple cultivar Gala were collected from trees growing in the orchard, placed on a tray in the laboratory, and spray-inoculated with a suspension of E. amylovora at a concentration of 10 8 cfu ml 21. Uninoculated detached flowers served as controls at each time point. Expression profiles were captured at three different time points post-inoculation at 2, 8, and 24 h, together with those at 0 h (uninoculated). A total of about 3500 genes were found to be significantly modulated in response to at least one of the three time points. Among those, a total of 770, 855, and 1002 genes were up-regulated, by 2-fold, at 2, 8, and 24 h following inoculation, respectively; while, 748, 1024, and 1455 genes were down-regulated, by 2-fold, at 2, 8, and 24 h following inoculation, respectively. Over the three time points post-inoculation, 365 genes were commonly up-regulated and 374 genes were commonly downregulated. Both sets of genes were classified based on their functional categories. The majority of up-regulated genes were involved in metabolism, signal transduction, signalling, transport, and stress response. A number of transcripts encoding proteins/enzymes known to be up-regulated under particular biotic and abiotic stress were also up-regulated following E. amylovora treatment. Those up-or down-regulated genes encode transcription factors, signaling components, defense-related, transporter, and metabolism, all of which have been associated with disease responses in Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting similar response pathways are involved in apple blossoms."

            "text": "Plants have developed various defence mechanisms that are associated with a number of early and late events with the initiation of both biotic and abiotic stresses. These plant defence responses include various physiological, molecular, and cellular events together with transcriptional activation of multiple genes of both known and unknown biochemical functions as well as the accumula-tion of secondary metabolites (Nakashita et al., 2003;Malnoy et al., 2007). These responses often entail the activation of the hypersensitive response (HR) and leading to the development of systemic acquired resistance (Ryals et al., 1996;Dangl and Jones, 2001). In addition, plants are capable of fortifying the extracellular matrix through cutin formation and callose deposition during pathogen infection (Dangl and Jones, 2001). A large-scale identification and analysis of genes induced upon pathogen inoculation is an essential step toward understanding the mechanisms of the plant defence response, which, in turn, will aid in the development of disease-resistant lines (Venisse et al., 2002;Liu et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Fire blight disease is a highly destructive bacterial disease of apples and pears. The disease is caused by the bacterial pathogen Erwinia amylovora which infects almost all the aerial parts of the tree including blossoms, fruits, vegetative shoots, woody tissues, and rootstock crowns, resulting in blossom blight, shoot blight, and rootstock blight (Norelli et al., 2003). Due to the wide diversity of host tissues susceptible to infection and the limited number of management tools available to control this disease, it has been difficult to eradicate or slow down the incidence of fire blight epidemics. Effective management includes, but is not limited to, reducing levels of inoculum in order to avoid the incidence of new infections, imposing barriers to the successful establishment of the pathogen, and reducing host susceptibility to infection (Aldwinckle and Beer, 1979). Management practices include the use of a few size-controlling rootstocks that are resistant to fire blight (Norelli et al., 2003) as most dwarfing rootstocks are susceptible to fire blight, and chemical treatments to enhance host resistance (Maxson-Stein et al., 2002). Recent efforts to develop genetically engineered apples expressing T 4 lysozyme and attacin genes and/or other antibacterial genes have been promising (Ko et al., 2002;Malnoy et al., 2007); however, commercial acceptance of such transgenic apples has not been successful.",

Total RNA from blossoms was isolated using a modified Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Gasic et al., 2004). Total RNA (2 lg) from each sample was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and used for cDNA synthesis. The first-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Oligo (dT) primer using SuperScript III RT kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific primers (Table 1) were designed using a Fast PCR program (http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi). The SYBR Green real-time PCR assay was carried out in a total volume of 25 ll, containing 12.5 ll of 23 SYBR Green I Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.2 lM (each) specific primers, and 100 ng of template cDNA. The amplification program consisted of 1 cycle of 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The fluorescent product was detected on the last step of each cycle. Following amplification, melting temperatures of PCR products were analysed to determine the specificity of the PCR product. Melting curves were obtained by slow heating at 0.5\u00b0C s \u00c01 , from 60\u00b0C to 90\u00b0C while continuously monitoring the fluorescence signal. A negative control without a cDNA template was run with each analysis to evaluate the overall specificity. Amplifications were carried out in 96-well plates in a 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in triplicate. An apple actin gene (Apple_0902.385.C2.Contig633) was used as a constitutive control gene. The results were presented as fold-change relative to the wild type (WT) at 0 h.",

Normalized data were further filtered for expression levels for quality control to eliminate genes in the array with no values throughout the study. A t test analysis of these genes, with a cut-off P value of <0.05, identified a collection of 3500 genes that were statistically significant for at least one of the three time points (Fig. 1). Among these, 1561 genes were up-regulated (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online); while 1939 genes were down-regulated (see Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online).

Approximately 90% of these defence-related proteins are up-regulated by more than 3-fold by 24 hpi. Among those, there are a number of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. PR proteins have been reported to be induced in several plant species during infection by viruses, viroids, fungi, or bacteria (Schenk et al., 2000;Cheong et al., 2002;Aswati Nair et al., 2010). Induction of these proteins is not pathogen-specific, but determined by the form of reaction of the host plant. PR proteins form protective barriers against pathogens leading to local or systemic resistance. In this study, transcriptional upregulation of PR proteins, TIR-NBS class disease resistance proteins, general stress response genes, such as peroxidases, and those possibly involved in antimicrobial metabolite production, such as cytochrome P450, have been detected. All of these proteins can be related to either local or systemic acquired resistance plant responses. Previously, Venisse et al. (2002) have reported that many defence mechanisms, including those of PR proteins, are elicited in both resistant and susceptible apple genotypes, although there is a delayed response in a number of genes involved in branch pathways of the phenylpropanoid metabolism in tissues of the susceptible apple genotype, MM 106 apple rootstock, when challenged with a wild-type strain of E. amylovora. Moreover, Venisse et al. (2002) have indicated that E. amylovora is capable of transiently preventing transcription of several isoforms of genes encoding chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR), and flavonol synthase (FLS) in leaves of the apple rootstock MM111.",

In fact, it has been reported that oxidative burst in flowers and shoots of susceptible apple tissues is observed during invasion of these tissues by E. amylovora (Venisse et al., 2002).

Of these genes, 61% of transcription regulators and 56% of signaling genes are up-regulated by more than 3-fold following E. amylovora infection. This indicates that these signalling components are transcriptionally-regulated during fire blight infection in apple blossoms. A gene encoding calcium-and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase is found to be up-regulated in apple blossoms following E. amylovora infection, suggesting that the calcium ion may be one of the key signals that initiate stress resistance reactions in blossoms. It has been reported that several CDPKs are likely to mediate biotic or abiotic stress responses. For example, one of the CDPKs has a known target, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), which plays an important role in plant defence responses against fungal elicitation in cell suspension cultures of French bean (Allwood et al., 2002); while, a tobacco CDPK, NtCDPK2, is involved in defence response against Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection (Romeis et al., 2001). Moreover, a non-expressor of PR genes, such as the Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 gene, has been identified as a key factor in transducing signals leading to systemic acquired resistance (Malnoy et al., 2007). Overexpression of an apple homologue of NPR1 in transgenic lines of fire blight-susceptible apple genotypes, cv. Galaxy and the rootstock M26, led to the activation of several PR genes and contributed to significantly enhanced resistance to fire blight in transgenic lines of apple (Malnoy et al., 2007).",

Conversely, ethylene insensitive 3 is down-regulated. Ethylene response sensors/ receptors function as negative regulators; therefore, elevated expression of ethylene receptor genes may serve to reduce hormonal responses. A similar observation has been reported in tomato fruit following inoculation with the biocontrol yeast Cryptococcus laurentii (Jiang et al., 2009). During biotic and abiotic stress conditions, signalling components have also been shown to undergo transcriptional regulation (Schenk et al., 2000). Interestingly, in this study, WRKY transcription factor and zinc finger (C3HC4-type RING finger and MYND type) family proteins are highly up-regulated in apple blossoms following E. amylovora treatment. WRKY proteins comprise a large family of transcription factors. As transcriptional regulators, WRKY factors are likely to act by directing temporal and spatial expression of specific genes, thereby ensuring proper cellular responses to internal and external stimuli (Ulker and Somssich, 2004). It has been reported that Arabidopsis plants expressing an AtWRKY18 showed enhanced levels of resistance to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae (Chen and Chen, 2002). Thus, the observed up-regulation of WRKY transcription factor and zinc finger family proteins are also involved in the early defence responses of apple blossoms to E. amylovora infection.",

Many of the genes in this category function as pathogen-responsive genes. This suggests that upon E. amylovora challenge, metabolismrelated genes are induced and serve as a key defence mechanism in apple. It is interesting to note that genes encoding enzymes that are involved in the mannose-binding lectin pathway are highly up-regulated. The mannose-binding lectin (MBL), also known as mannose binding protein (MBP), appears to be involved in pattern recognition in the first line of defence in the pre-immune host. Specifically, MBL recognizes carbohydrate patterns found along surfaces of large numbers of pathogenic micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi, where it can activate its complements (Turner and Hamvas, 2000). Binding of MBL to a microorganism results in the activation of the lectin pathway of the complement system. E. amylovora infection strongly increases transcription of curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein genes in apple blossoms.",

Lipoxygenases (LOX) are enzymes that are widely found in higher plants. LOXs catalyse the synthesis of oxylipin which is a potent signalling molecule involved in the defence reactions of both animals and plants (Blee, 2002;La Camera, 2004). This enzyme is involved in the initiation of lipid peroxidation which contributes to the development of a hypersensitive reaction (HR) during an incompatible host-pathogen interaction (Croft et al., 1990). The role of lipid peroxidation has been investigated as a possible early step in the signal transduction mechanism leading to phytoalexin synthesis (Cornille et al., 1998). The primary products of LOX, fatty acid hydroperoxides, are highly reactive, and may cause oxidative membrane damage leading to cell necrosis and premature cell death (Hildebrand, 1998). In some cases, lipid pentadienyl, peroxyl free radicals, or other active oxygen species such as the superoxide anion may also be generated by LOX action (Roy et al., 1994). These reactive bursts occurring during the plant defence response have been reported to promote hypersensitive cell death (Levine et al., 1994).",

Serine carboxypeptidases (SCPs) are proteins belonging to the hydrolase family (Fraser et al., 2005) that share characteristic structural features, including a signal sequence for intracellular trafficking and/or secretion, multiple N-linked glycosylation sites, and four evolutionarily conserved regions that consist of a substrate-binding domain and three catalytic sites (Vendrell and Aviles, 1999). It has been reported that a rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene is involved in defence responses against biotic and oxidative stresses (Liu et al., 2008). Therefore, the observed up-regulation of SCPs in apple blossoms challenged with E. amylovora is of interest and deserves further investigation.",

Increased expression of cell wall biosynthesis-and modification-related genes has also been observed in Arabidopsis following challenge with the fungal pathogen Alternaria. brassicicola or following wounding stress (Schenk et al., 2000;Cheong et al., 2003).

E. amylovora infection causes more than a 3-fold increased transcription of genes encoding ethylene response sensors, and, in particular, an ethylene response factor. Conversely, the down-regulation of transcription of an ethylene-insensitive gene is observed in E. amylovora-infected apple blossoms. This finding suggests that an ethylene response sensor/factor functions as a regulator to induce expression of ethylene responsive genes. Ruperti et al. (2002) have identified four ethylene response genes in abscission zones of young developing fruit of peach that were homologous to thaumatin-like proteins, PR-4 proteins, and to fungal and plant b-D-xylosidases. It is probable that the ethylene response sensor in apple is involved in regulating the expression of ethylene response factors that mediate cellular signalling following E. amylovora infection of apple blossoms.",

In this study using an apple microarray comprised of 40, 000 genes, global expression of transcripts regulated by the bacterial pathogen E. amylovora in blossoms of apple cv. Gala provided a more comprehensive assessment of gene expression profiles at three different time points following infection. These findings provide an overview of the underlying mechanisms related to modulation and regulation of various biochemical pathways in response to fire blight infection. However, it should be pointed out that some of the genes investigated in this microarray study lack annotation, and therefore their roles in the fire blight disease response are yet to be elucidated, which, in turn, may provide further insights into these findings.",

            "text": "In this study, when blossoms of the apple cultivar Gala are infected with E. amylovora, many plant defence genes, including those coding for PR proteins, are elicited within a period of 24 h following infection. Among the up-regulated genes are those involved in transcription, such as WRKY DNA-binding protein 18/33, zinc and RING finger family proteins, and ethylene-response factor 1, as well as those involved in transport, such as high affinity K + transporter 5 and cation/H + exchanger 2, and those involved in signalling, such as serine/threonine protein kinase, calcium-and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase/kinase, and ethylene response sensor 1. However, these up-regulated groups of genes as well as those of PR family proteins, such as acidic endochitinase, TIR-NBS class disease resistance proteins, stress response proteins, peroxidases, and cell wall associated proteins are either not sustained for long durations following infection or they do not accumulate to high enough levels during the early stages of infection of apple blossoms in fire blight-susceptible apple genotypes, such as 'Gala'. Moreover, it is important to note that genes encoding enzymes involved in oxylipin signalling, LOX genes, are highly down-regulated in blossoms of 'Gala' during the first 24 h following E. amylovora infection. These signalling genes, together with those involved in modulating role(s) such as those coding for ethylene response sensors/factors, as well as those associated with cell wall hydrolase activities are all contributing to the regulation of the disease response; i.e. a delayed defence response, in apple blossoms during the early stages of infection in the fire blight-susceptible cv. Gala."
