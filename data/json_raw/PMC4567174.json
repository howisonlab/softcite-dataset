            "text": "Nanoparticles have been widely used for nonviral gene delivery. Recently, cationic hybrid nanoparticles consisting of two different materials were suggested as a promising delivery vehicle. In this study, nanospheres with a poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) core and cationic lipid shell were prepared, and the effect of cationic lipid concentrations on the properties of lipid polymer hybrid nanocarriers investigated. Lipid-polymer hybrid nanospheres (LPHNSs) were fabricated by the emulsion-solvent evaporation method using different concentrations of cationic lipids and characterized for size, surface charge, stability, plasmid DNA-binding capacity, cytotoxicity, and transfection efficiency. All LPHNSs had narrow size distribution with positive surface charges (\u03b6-potential 52-60 mV), and showed excellent plasmid DNA-binding capacity. In vitro cytotoxicity measurements with HEK293T, HeLa, HaCaT, and HepG2 cells also showed that LPHNSs exhibited less cytotoxicity than conventional transfection agents, such as Lipofectamine and polyethyleneimine-PLGA. As cationic lipid concentrations increased, the particle size of LPHNSs decreased while their \u03b6-potential increased. In addition, the in vitro transfection efficiency of LPHNSs increased as lipid concentration increased.",

            "text": "Gene therapy has emerged as a potent therapeutic approach for numerous diseases, including cancer. 1 Accordingly, gene therapy using traditional Chinese medicine, gene-delivery systems, and genetic engineering have been widely studied. However, the clinical success of gene therapy is still uncertain. [2][3][4] In particular, designing efficient gene-delivery vectors with low cytotoxicity is considered a major challenge among scientists. 5,6 In clinical trials, viral vectors that have been widely used as gene-delivery carriers have exhibited severe toxicity and caused side effects. 1,2,7 Therefore, there is an increasing demand for the development of nonviral delivery vectors with the ability to overcome physiological barriers. 8 Among the various nonviral gene vectors, cationic lipids are ideal gene carriers because of their high transfection efficiency, excellent gene-incorporation ability, and ease of preparation. 1,9 However, their clinical uses are limited, because of their instability and poor reproducibility caused by high batch-to-batch variation. 10 Alternatively, biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been investigated, due to their small particle size, ease of surface functionalization, excellent physiological stability, and sustained-release profiles. 11 However, the low transfection efficiency of polymeric NPs has hindered their clinical success.",

            "text": "Therefore, there is an increasing demand for a hybrid vector to overcome the barriers associated with conventional gene carriers. 12 Recently, lipid-polymer hybrid nanospheres (LPHNSs) were designed to achieve complementary benefits of liposomes and polymeric NSs. [13][14][15] They were designed to have a biodegradable polymer core and lipid layers. 14,16 Depending on their application, specific fabrication methods have been reported. 17 In the past, LPHNSs were prepared by two-step methods that required introducing lipid vesicles into preformed polymeric NSs. 18 However, this method is inefficient, because of practical difficulties and process complexity. 12 Alternatively, a single-step fabrication method was developed, which combined the fabrication process of emulsion-solvent evaporation with the self-assembly of lipids. 15 Although successful outcomes have been achieved using the single-step method, a better understanding of the parameters involved in the fabrication process is required in order to significantly improve the design and fabrication of LPHNSs. 19,20 Specifically, cationic lipids forming outer shells could allow for superior gene-delivery capabilities. However, it is still not clear how lipid concentration affects the formation of LPHNSs. Furthermore, it is important to balance the amount of lipids, because despite being a key factor for DNA delivery, a high concentration of cationic lipids could result in cytotoxicity. Therefore, in order to optimize their performance, it is necessary to understand the influence of cationic lipid concentration on various properties of LPHNSs. 21 The present study describes a simple and efficient method for fabrication of LPHNSs, and examined the influence of cationic lipid concentration on the structural and functional characteristics of LPHNSs. We rationally designed LPHNS formulations with four different ratios of cationic lipids to polymer during the fabrication step. Then, the LPHNSs were compared with various controls, including poly(d,l-lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA), liposomes, and polyethyleneimine (PEI)-PLGA NSs.",

The water-in-oil emulsion was formed by the addition of an aqueous phase into an organic phase with sonication (ultrasonic probe; Sonics & Materials Inc, Newtown, CT, USA). The primary emulsion was transferred to 1% w/v PVA aqueous solution and sonicated in an ice bath. The resultant secondary (water in oil in water) emulsion was stirred overnight at room temperature until evaporation of dichloromethane was complete. The final formulated LPHNSs were collected by ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 minutes (Optima L-100 XP Ultra Centrifuge; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). Then, they were washed three times by a repeating centrifugation step and freeze-dried at -20\u00b0C for 48 hours. At least three batches were prepared for each formulation. To investigate the influence of cationic lipid concentrations on size, charge, and in vitro performance, we prepared four formulation groups of LPHNSs with different concentrations of cationic lipid (DOTAP) to polymer ratio, as shown in Table 1. All other parameters were kept constant. PLGA NSs were also fabricated as described and used to prepare the PEI-PLGA NSs for comparison. 22 ",

The shape and surface morphology of the LPHNSs were initially investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-6700F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. For the sample preparation, one drop of the NS dispersion was drop casted on a carbon tape supported by the stub, and the water was evaporated under reduced pressure. Thin layers of dried particle were sputter coated with platinum by an Auto Fine Coater (JEOL) for 30 seconds at 30 mA. The core-shell structures of LPHNSs and LPHNS-pDNA complexes were further confirmed by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM). 26 EFTEM experiments were carried out with a Libra 120 microscope (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany), and samples were prepared by depositing 20 \u00b5L of LPHNS suspension (0.5 mg/ mL) onto a 200-mesh carbon-coated copper grid. Samples were blotted away after 30 minutes' incubation, and grids were negatively stained with freshly prepared and sterile-filtered 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate aqueous solution. The grids were then washed twice with distilled water and air-dried prior to imaging. The core-shell hybrid structure of LPHNSs was further confirmed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Carl Zeiss LSM 510 Meta) with fluorescent LPHNSs.",

As shown in Table 1, it was observed that the mean diameters (z-average sizes) of LPHNSs with cationic lipid concentrations of 6% w/w (group A), 12% w/w (group B), 18% w/w (group C), and 24% w/w (group D) were 209\u00b110.4, 186\u00b17.3, 163\u00b15.6, and 154\u00b15.2 nm, respectively. DLS analysis revealed that there was a significant size reduction (Figures 2A, S1) compared to bare PLGA NSs (247\u00b112.8 nm), which could be explained by the fact that the processing of those particles in a single step was stabilized by the function of the lipids with PVA. 15,20 It was also found that there was a decrease in particle size Figure 1 schematic diagram of lPhNs nanoparticles as gene-delivery vectors. Notes: LPHNSs that consisted of DOTAP-protamine-PLGA for efficient gene delivery were fabricated by emulsion-solvent evaporation with a self-assembly process. The superior cationic charges of lPhNss assisted to form a complex with pDNa and enhance condensation ability, which facilitated the higher cellular uptake and intracellular release of pDNa. The scale represents 100 \u00b5m.

The concentration of cationic lipids could play a significant role in controlling the size of LPHNSs, possibly reducing the coalescence of particles. 32 Furthermore, it was found that the higher lipid concentration (24% w/w DOTAP) with constant protamine considerably decreased LPHNS-pDNA complex size (z-average) than the less lipid group (6% w/w DOTAP). The synergistic effect of cationic lipid and protamine could have been the possible reason, as observed in earlier studies. 33 ",

As expected, the inclusion of cationic lipids changed the surface charges of the particles. All LPHNSs had positive charges compared with the negative charge of bare PLGA NSs (-24\u00b14 mV). As shown in Table 1, the \u03b6-potentials of LPHNSs with cationic lipid concentrations of 6% w/w (group A), 12% w/w (group B), 18% w/w (group C), and 24% w/w (group D) were 36\u00b13, 50\u00b11.8, 57\u00b12.2, and 64\u00b12 mV, respectively. However, the addition of negatively charged pDNA to the LPHNSs led to a slight charge reduction, as shown in Figure 3C. Considering that the surface area of LPHNSs decreased with increasing concentration, which might lead to a decrease in the incorporation of cationic lipids, an increase in the surface charges with increasing lipid concentration was unexpected. 35 We believe that this finding will help with the optimization of LPHNSs for the purpose of transfection and delivery of multiple bioactive molecules in the future.",

As shown in Figure 2C and D, FESEM and EFTEM showed that all formulation groups (A, B, C, and D) exhibited the perfect HNS size (~150-250 nm). The particle size observed from the EFTEM image was in agreement with that determined by DLS (Figures 2A, S1). Further, EFTEM confirmed the formation of an HNS consisting of a PLGA core covered by a thin lipid monolayer. The negative staining further confirmed the core-shell structure of LPHNSs. Additionally, EFTEM confirmed the particle-size reduction (~209-154 nm) when the lipid concentration was increased from 6% to 24% w/w. It appeared that 6% DOTAP was unable to control the NS aggregation, whereas 24% w/w DOTAP effectively controlled the aggregation. We speculated that the DOTAP played a synergistic role as a stabilizer of PVA more efficiently at higher concentrations than at lower concentrations. To visualize the core-shell structure and lipid assembly further, two different fluorescent dyes -NBD-PC (0.5 mg/mL) with DOTAP and Rhodamine (1 mg/mL) with PLGA -were used to synthesize fluorescent LPHNSs and examined using confocal microscopy. The fluorescence image in Figure 2E clearly illustrates the self-assembly process of the lipidpolymer core-shell structure by forming a uniform green fluorescence on a red fluorescence from the surface of the inner core. Furthermore, EFTEM clearly shows the difference between LPHNSs and LPHNS-pDNA complexes ( Figure S2).",

The LPHNS-pDNA complexes were prepared as described in the Materials and methods section. As shown in Figure 3A, with increasing cationic lipid (DOTAP) concentration in the LPHNS formulation, DNA-incorporation efficiency increased. When the DOTAP lipid concentration was increased from 6% to 24% w/w, the pDNA-incorporation ability improved significantly (results not shown). However, the NS-pDNA ratio played a crucial role in DNA incorporation, and it was observed that at higher LPHNS particle concentrations (.130 \u00b5g), 1 \u00b5g of pDNA was retained. However, at such a high NS concentration, cytotoxicity increased and cell viability decreased below 80% (results not shown). On the other hand, less than 100 \u00b5g of LPHNS particle concentration (,100 \u00b5g) was unable to compact the pDNA completely, as shown in Figure 3A. Therefore, we included protamine in the LPHNSs during the fabrication process (Figure 1). Incorporation of protamine in the LPHNS formulation resulted in strong pDNA binding and retention in all LPHNS-formulation groups (A, B, C, and D) at various NS concentrations (15,30,60, and 90 \u00b5g) ( Figure 3B and C). Furthermore, the synergistic effect of protamine and lipid resulted in a higher degree of complexation with pDNA, explaining the role of protamine as a DNA-condensing agent ( Figures 3C, S2). 37",

It is well known that lipoplexes and polyplexes exhibit high cytotoxicity. 8 The experimental results confirmed similar cytotoxicity for Lipofectamine and PEI-PLGA-pDNA complexes, as shown in Figure 4. Notably, all LPHNS-pDNA complexes exhibited low cytotoxicity (cell viability .70%), even at higher NS concentrations (90 \u00b5g) for 293T, HeLa, HaCaT, and HepG2 cells. In addition, groups with higher lipid concentrations, such as LPHNS group C with 18% w/w DOTAP and group D with 24% w/w DOTAP, did not exhibit severe cytotoxicity (.70% cell viability in all tested cells). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of concentration of LPHNS-pDNA complexes on cell viability of HEK293 cells by using 15, 30, 60, and 90 \u00b5g of LPHNSs with 1 \u00b5g of pDNA. The experimental results confirmed that all tested NS-pDNA complexes exhibited comparatively lower cytotoxicity than PEI-PLGA NS-pDNA complexes (90:1 w/w) ( Figure S3). It was also observed that there was a slight increase in cytotoxicity for both PEI-PLGA and LPHNSs. It has been confirmed in various tissues that cationic liposome-based lipoplexes show dose-dependent toxicity. 8,39 The size, charge ratio, and amount of free lipid present in the cationic liposome may be the reason for the increased cytotoxicity of cationic lipoplexes. 40 However, our LPHNS system's nanosize (~150-200 nm) and biodegradable lipid-polymer hybrid could be the major contributors to the low cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the spherical shape and less aggregation of LPHNSs could be the reason for low cytotoxicity, since cytotoxicity of NSs depends on the nature of the aggregates formed and morphology of lipoplexes (Figure 3). 41 Ample evidence exists showing that polymeric NPs or liposomes alone cause cytotoxicity. Therefore, to overcome this problem, lipid-polymer hybrid architectures have been designed, which combine the mechanical (stability) advantages of biodegradable polymeric NPs and the biomimetic advantages of liposomes. 8,17 ",

Transfection efficiency in all four cell lines was slightly different, as shown in Figure 4B. When the cationic lipid concentration increased from 6% to 24% w/w at a specific NS concentration (90 \u00b5g), the transgene-expression level increased from 48% to 85% in HEK293 cells. At the same NS concentration, the transgene-expression level increased from 27% to 50% in the HeLa cells. Similar trends were observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, where transfection efficiency increased from 13% to 40%, and in immortalized human keratinocytes, where transgene-expression level increased from 30% to 53%. Interestingly, all formulation groups of LPHNSs showed markedly enhanced transfection efficiencies in HEK293 cells compared with other tested cells, as shown in Figure 4C. This could be attributed to the biochemical machinery of HEK293 cells, capable of carrying out most of the posttranslational folding and processing required to generate functional and mature protein from a wide spectrum of both mammalian and nonmammalian nucleic acids. 42 Lipid concentration-dependent transfection efficiency was observed in all four tested cell lines ( Figure 4C). The transfection efficiencies of LPHNSs with protamine increased significantly as expected, but was slightly different in different cell types. For instance, in HEK293 cells, LPHNS group D exhibited enhanced gene expression (85%) compared to group A (48%), group B (61%), and group C (72%), while transgene expression in other cell types was not as different as in HEK293 cells. However, we observed that the type of cells marginally influenced transgene expression ( Figure 4C). It was evident in the cervical cancer (HeLa) cells that experimental group D had a higher transgene-expression level (50%) compared to group A (27%), group B (33%), and group C (45%). Particularly, the transgene-expression capability of LPHNSs and the effect of cell type on transgene expression among cell lines were investigated in additional cells. ( Figure 4C) A similar trend of lipid concentration-dependent transfection was also observed in HepG2 cells, where group D had a higher gene-expression level (40%) compared to group A (17%), group B (24%), and group C (32%). In immortalized human keratinocytes, the transgene expression of group D showed superior efficiency (54%) compared to the lower lipid-concentration counterparts, as observed in group A (30%), group B (42%), and group C (46%), demonstrating that the transfection activity of the cationic lipid-protamine polymer hybrid nanocarrier was significantly dependent on their cationic lipid concentration.",

The cellular uptake of LPHNSs in all tested groups (A, B, C, and D) was higher than PEI-modified PLGA NSs for the same incubation time. As shown in Figure 5A, group D (DOTAP 24% w/w) had a higher cellular uptake, reaching more than 85% after 24 hours of incubation, while group A had ~60% uptake of LPHNSs. Based on these results, the particle-uptake rate and the final amount of HNSs inside the cells were strongly dependent on the cationic lipid concentrations. The results from flow cytometry were further evaluated with CLSM, as shown in Figure 5B. Interestingly, LPHNSs were found in the cytoplasm of cells, and were in close proximity to the nucleus. With increasing concentrations of DOTAP in the LPHNS formulation, the HNSs were formed as aggregates in the proximity of the nucleus. The possible explanation for the formation of an aggregated vesicle-like structure may be that DOTAP-mediated gene-delivery carriers are internalized by cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and efficiently released from the acidic endosomal compartment prior to endosome/lysosomal degradation. Therefore, the DNA is accumulated near the perinuclear region of the cells; our results demonstrated that the size of the aggregates may be indirectly proportional to the DOTAP concentration. Alternately, polyplexes (PEI-PLGA) probably follow caveolae-mediated uptake, leading to scattered fluorescence in the cytoplasm. 44 The group with the lowest concentration of cationic lipid (group A [6% w/w of DOTAP]) formed large, scattered aggregates close to the nucleus. When the concentration of cationic lipid in the LPHNS formulation was increased from 6% to 24% w/w (Figure 5B), the \u03b6-potentials (positive charge) of the hybrid nanocarriers also increased significantly, probably leading to vesicle-like aggregate formation. 45 The propensity to form aggregates in the cytoplasm, particularly close to the nucleus, is a special feature of lipid-based nanocarriers. 46 On the contrary, PEI-PLGA NSs do not form vesicle-like structures, and become scattered in the cytoplasm. 28 Analysis of LPHNSs with different concentrations of DOTAP lipid (6%, 12%, 18%, and 24% w/w) demonstrated that cationic lipid concentration played a crucial role in cellular uptake and transfection efficiency of LPHNSs. 28 The data were consistent with the major role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the internalization of DOTAP lipoplexes. 44 ",
