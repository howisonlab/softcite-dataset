This article explores the role that access to information technology, in particular, plays in enhancing, or possibly detracting from, the transfer function of the community college. Using data from the first-ever field experiment randomly providing free computers to students, we examine the relationships between access to home computers and enrollment in transferable courses and actual transfers to 4-year colleges. The results from the field experiment indicate that the treatment group of students receiving free computers has a 4.5 percentage point higher probability of taking transferable courses than the control group of students not receiving free computers. The evidence is less clear for the effects on actual transfers to 4-year colleges and the probability of using a computer to search for college information (which possibly represents one of the mechanisms for positive effects). In both cases, point estimates are positive, but the confidence intervals are wide. Finally, power calculations indicate that sample sizes would have to be considerably larger to find statistically significant treatment effects and reasonably precise confidence intervals given the actual transfer rate point estimates.",

            "text": "On the other hand, having access to a home computer may enhance the ability of community college students to acquire information about the value, requirements, and career opportunities provided by 2-year college degrees and certificates. Although the original goal of community colleges was to provide basic requirements training for entry to 4-year colleges, their role in providing terminal degrees, workforce training, and basic skills education has expanded (Leigh and Gill 2007). The labor market returns for the various degrees, diplomas, and certificates offered by community colleges are large (Jepsen et al. 2009). The acquisition of this information may divert students away from transferring to 4year colleges. A similar concern has been raised about the overall \"diversion\" effect of community colleges. Several previous studies find that attending a community college lowers the likelihood of ultimately obtaining a bachelor's degree possibly due to increased opportunity costs, inadequate preparation, part-time enrollment, and displacement through curricular emphasis on vocational degrees (Alfonso 2006;Long and Kurlaender 2009). 6 The increased autonomy offered by access to a home computer may also lead to extensive use for games, networking, downloading music and videos, communicating with friends, and other entertainment, potentially crowding out schoolwork time, college search, 5. The previous literature provides some evidence of positive effects of home computers on educational outcomes such as test scores, grades, and graduation, but overall the evidence is mixed (see Attewell and Battle 1999;Fuchs and Woessmann 2004;Fairlie 2005;Fairlie, Beltan, and  6. Previous research, however, also finds evidence that community colleges have increased overall access to higher education often referred to as the \"democratization\" effect (Gonzalez and Hilmer 2006;Leigh andGill 2003, 2004;Rouse 1995Rouse , 1998.

An empirical test of the hypothesis is therefore needed, but has not been conducted in the previous literature. This is due, in part, to the inherent selection problems in estimating the effects of personal computers on educational outcomes. To address the lack of empirical evidence on the question and concerns about causal inference, we use data from the first-ever field experiment providing free computers to community college students for home use to explore the relationship between access to computers and transferring to 4-year colleges. Participating students were randomly selected to receive free computers and their course-taking and transfer behavior was tracked in subsequent years. The random-assignment evaluation is conducted with 286 entering students receiving financial aid at a large 7. The impact of the extensive use of Facebook among college students on academic outcomes has recently received some attention (Karpinski 2009 andPasek andHargittai 2009). The attention is partly due to the dramatic increase in the use of social networking sites such as Facebook in the past few years (Lenhart 2009). These concerns are similar to those over television (Zavodny 2006). community college in Northern California. Previous findings from the experiment provide some evidence that the randomly selected group of students receiving free computers achieved better educational outcomes than the control group that did not receive free computers, but the study does not examine the potential transfer function of the community college (Fairlie and London 2012). 8 In this article, we conduct a detailed analysis of the causal effects of home computers on the transfer function of community colleges for low-income students. In an examination of the effects of home computers on several different educational outcomes, Fairlie and London (2012) find positive estimates of the effects on taking transfer courses. We expand on that finding in several ways. First, and foremost, we obtain new data from the National Student Clearinghouse on actual transfers to 4-year colleges among all participants in the experiment. 9 These data allow for an analysis of not only 8. Previous results from the experiment also indicate that estimates of the effects of home computers on graduating from community college are much smaller than nonexperimental estimates from matched CPS data suggesting that nonexperimental estimates may be biased upward (Fairlie and London 2012). 9. The Institutional Research Department at the community college recently analyzed transfer rates of all of its students through specially commissioned data from the National Student Clearinghouse. We obtained these data for our sample of 286 students participating in the study providing a 4-year window in which to observe transfers. whether computers affect interest or intent to transfer to a 4-year college but also whether they affect actual transfers. These data as well as data on transfer course enrollment are taken from administrative data removing concerns about differential attrition or reporting biases. Second, we report new estimates on treatment heterogeneity by educational goals. Focusing on the effects of computers on transfers to 4-year colleges suggests that students with the initial goal of transferring versus those with another goal might be affected differently. Third, new results on the effects of home computers on self-reported college search are reported. These results provide suggestive evidence on possible mechanisms. The findings on the effects on taking transfer courses, searching for college information, heterogeneity by educational goal, and actual transfer rates are also discussed in the context of the literature examining what contributes to transfer rates among community college students.",

In fall 2006, there were 1,042 financial aid students and 6,681 students in total who met the course unit restriction. Participating students were required to return a baseline questionnaire and consent form releasing future academic records from the college for the study. Students who already owned computers were not excluded from participating in the lottery because their computers may have been much older and not fully functional with the latest software and hardware. 10 There were 286 students who participated in the study with 141 of these students receiving free computers. All the computers were refurbished and were provided by Computers for Classrooms, Inc., a computer refurbisher located in Chico, California. 11 Internet service was not provided as part of the experiment, but we found at the end of the study that more than 90% of the treatment group had Internet service. Because of high rates of Internet subscription among computer owners we cannot identify separate effects of computers and the Internet, which has been a problem in previous studies (Fairlie, Beltan, and Das 2010). More than 90% of eligible students picked up their free computers by the end of November 2006.",

These differences, however, are small. Although study participants are a self-selected group from all financial aid students, they do not appear to be very different from either financial aid students or the entire student body along observable characteristics. They may differ, however, along dimensions directly related to participation in the study. Specifically, they may have less access to computers and disposable income than other financial aid students. These differences have implications for our ability to generalize the results based on study participants to all community college students receiving financial aid. But, students with limited access to computers and financial resources are the population of most interest for any policy intervention involving the provision of free or subsidized computers. Table 2 reports a comparison of background characteristics for the treatment and control groups. All study participants were given a baseline survey that included detailed questions on gender, race, age, high school grades, household income, parents' education, and other characteristics. The average age of study participants is 25. More than half of the students have a parent with at least some college education, and about one third of students received mostly grades of A's and B's in high school. A little over one quarter of study participants have children and one third live with their parents.

In the CSU system, 55.3% of students from the 2007-2008 cohort previously attended a community college. Of the 42,416 students in the 2007-2008 cohort in the University of California system, 29.4% previously attended a community college. The community college system clearly provides a route to university education for many students in California. Identifying the potential barriers to transferring to 4-year colleges for other students is important for improving overall access to higher education. Informational constraints may represent one such barrier to attending 4-year colleges, especially among low-income students (American Association of Community Colleges 2004; Dowd and Gabbard 2006;Furchtgott-Roth, Jacobson, and Mokher 2009).",

However, computers also allow students to gather more information on the value and requirements of getting an associate's or vocational degree, which may discourage students from transferring to 4-year colleges, as well as provide a distraction through their entertainment value. In this section, we turn to the field experiment to estimate the transfer function of home computers. We first examine impacts on the likelihood that community college students take courses that are transferable to the CSU or UC systems before turning to an analysis of data on actual transfers.

Constraints may include the high cost, reduced flexibility in course offerings to accommodate working, and more challenging coursework of 4-year universities (Council on Postsecondary Education 2004). As noted above, information on transfers to 4-year colleges is obtained from college enrollment data from the beginning of the experiment through 4 years later. We find that 21.3% of the treatment group transfers to a 4-year college compared with 20.0% of the control group. The difference of 1.3 percentage points, however, is not statistically significant. Table 6 reports estimates of treatment effects using 1 for the transfer rate to 4-year colleges. After controlling for baseline characteristics, we find a similar point estimate for the treatment effect, but the coefficient is also statistically insignificant. Some caution is warranted in interpreting these estimates, however, as the 95% confidence intervals are very large. With the full set of controls, the confidence interval is \u22120.081 to 0.101. Relative to the base transfer rate, this confidence interval ranges from \u221240% of the control group mean to +51% of the control group mean implying that only very large negative and positive treatment effects can be ruled out from the experiment.

Table A2 reports power calculations assuming different effect sizes. 19 To detect a statistically significant effect for a treatment-control difference of 0.01 at the \u03b1 = 0.05 level of significance it would require a sample size of more than 25,000 observations. Given the cost of computers at $400-500 conducting an experiment with this 18. Consistent with this finding, we find negative point treatment estimates (but very imprecise) for the probability of transfers to other 4-year colleges (i.e., not a CSU campus).",

            "text": "How do we translate these hypothetical treatment effects sizes into whether they are economically meaningful, and thus whether we can detect economically meaningful treatment effects with different sample sizes? One way is to place them in the perspective of reducing disparities in transfer rates. For example, the state-wide difference in transfer rates between underrepresented minorities and whites is roughly 10 percentage points (Sengupta and Jepsen 2006), suggesting that a policy intervention that could reduce this racial gap by one fifth (a 0.02 treatment effect) would be economically meaningful. Another method of assessing the magnitude is to examine the total cost of influencing one more student to transfer and comparing it to the potential returns to transferring. A treatment effect of 0.02 which is 10% of the control group mean implies that 50 computers (at a total cost of roughly $22,500) would have to be given out to increase the number of students transferring by 1. A total cost of $45,000 would be required to induce one more transfer with a treatment effect of 0.01 (5% of the control group mean). U.S. Census Bureau (2011) estimates indicate that mean annual earnings for individuals with a bachelor's degree are nearly $25,000 higher than with an associate's degree. However, the actual average returns to transferring are likely to be much lower with the uncertainty of obtaining a degree. If these returns were only $5,000 per year then the total cost of the computers would be recovered in a few years if the treatment effect is 0.02, but would take much longer for an effect size of 0.01. Although it is difficult to determine what an economically meaningful effect size would be in this context, it appears as though an effect size of 0.02 is clearly large, economically meaningful, and policy relevant, but even in this case we would need 6,510 observations to obtain statistical significance.",

The literature on the transfer function of community colleges, however, has emphasized the importance of controlling for the educational goals of community college students (see Leigh andGill 2003, 2007;Alfonso 2006;and Long and Kurlaender 2009, for example). Students attend community colleges for many different reasons potentially placing them at varying levels of risk of having a desire to take transfer courses and transfer to 4-year colleges. As reported in Table 3 and discussed above, we find from administrative data based on the self-reported educational goals of students on their original application to the college, 37.4% of study participants reported being \"undecided,\" 31.5% reported \"transfer to a 4-year institution,\" and 24.5% reported a goal other than transferring to a 4-year college. Controlling for these educational goals has little effect on the treatment effect estimates, but there is the possibility that having a home computer may have differential effects on transfer behavior depending on the initial goals of the student. Table 8 provides evidence on this question from regressions in which treatment status is interacted with the three major educational goals at the time of application. The main treatment effect captures the treatment effect for the most common educational goal, \"undecided.\" For taking transfer courses, we find that home computers have essentially no effect on \"undecided\" Notes: The dependent variable is whether the course is transferable to a California State University or University of California campus in Specifications 1 and 2 and whether the student transfers to a 4-year college in Specifications 3 and 4. Robust standard errors are reported and adjusted for multiple courses taken by study participants. Baseline controls include gender, race/ethnicity, age, parents' highest education level, high school grades, presence of own children, live with parents, family income, and educational goals. students. The effects of home computers on taking transfer courses are stronger, however, for students with an initial goal of transferring to a 4-year college. We also find that students with nontransfer goals are relatively more likely to take transferable courses when receiving a free computer. The computer may have changed their goal or simply allowed these students to take more challenging and demanding courses at the community college.",

Community colleges in some states, such as California, already play a major role in university education with nearly half of all 4-year college students having previously attended a community college (California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office 2009). In this paper, we use data from the first-ever randomized field experiment providing free computers to students for home use to explore whether having access to home computers improves the transfer function of community colleges. If limited information is an important constraint for transferring to 4-year colleges, especially among low-income community college students, then having access to computers at home may help overcome this barrier and lead to higher labor market returns.",

Home computers may have changed the desire to transfer or increased student confidence in taking more challenging and demanding transfer courses, but other barriers to transferring to 4-year colleges were just too large. Barriers such as the cost of 4-year colleges, added challenge of taking 4-year college courses, and lack of courses offered to accommodate nontraditional or working students might be especially restrictive (Council on Postsecondary Education 2004). We find some evidence that students who did not initially have a goal of transferring to a 4-year college had larger positive effects from the computers than undecided and transfer goal students. We also find some suggestive evidence that students with transfer goals benefit more from home computers in terms of increasing their likelihood of transferring to 4-year colleges.",

The findings from this experiment suggest that having access to a home computer may be useful for finding information about 4-year university choices, admission requirements, tuition, financial aid, and which courses are transferable, which ultimately may counteract some of the \"diversion\" effects of attending a community college. The 1.2 million community college students in the United States without access to home computers and the Internet, however, may be at a disadvantage in acquiring information helpful for transferring to 4-year universities and obtaining jobs requiring these skills. To overcome this barrier, policies that provide access to computers for low-income students, such as tax breaks or special loans for educational computer purchases, expanded computer refurbishing programs, and laptop checkout programs may be needed (Servon 2002, Warschauer 2006. Addressing this barrier may become increasingly important as more application, financial aid, registration and course information is being placed online and public institutions reduce staff in response to budget cutbacks. More research on these important questions, preferably with larger sample sizes, is clearly needed.
