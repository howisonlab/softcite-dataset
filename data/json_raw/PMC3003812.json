In spite of limiting photosynthetic carbon assimilation, especially in those environments where drought is the predominant factor affecting plant growth and yield, the effects of water deprivation on the mechanisms that control Rubisco activity are unclear. In the present study, 11 Mediterranean species, representing different growth forms, were subject to increasing levels of drought stress, the most severe one followed by rewatering. The results confirmed species-specific patterns in the decrease in the initial activity and activation state of Rubisco as drought stress and leaf dehydration intensified. Nevertheless, all species followed roughly the same trend when Rubisco activity was related to stomatal conductance (g s) and chloroplastic CO 2 concentration (C c), suggesting that deactivation of Rubisco sites could be induced by low C c , as a result of water stress. The threshold level of C c that triggered Rubisco deactivation was dependent on leaf characteristics and was related to the maximum attained for each species under non-stressing conditions. Those species adapted to low C c were more capable of maintaining active Rubisco as drought stress intensified.",

            "text": "Worldwide, water availability is considered the environmental factor that most strongly influences plant growth and yield (Boyer, 1982), and global climate change is expected to exacerbate water limitations in semi-arid ecosystems like the Mediterranean (IPCC 2007). Although photosynthesis has frequently been documented among the primary physiological processes affected by water shortage, a controversy still exists on whether drought effects on photosynthesis are due to 'stomatal' or 'non-stomatal' limitations (Flexas and Medrano, 2002;Lawlor and Cornic, 2002). Stomatal limitations result from the resistance to CO 2 diffusion from the atmosphere to intercellular leaf spaces, while nonstomatal limitations are often assumed to be metabolic constraints. However, there is increasing evidence that the conductance determining transfer of CO 2 from the intercellular leaf spaces to the vicinity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), i.e. the mesophyll conductance, g m , has a finite value and frequently decreases under drought (Flexas et al., 2008;Warren, 2008). Therefore, the controversy of 'stomatal' versus 'non-stomatal' limitations of photosynthesis has been replaced by 'diffusive' versus 'metabolic' (or biochemical) limitations (Grassi and Magnani, 2005;Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007b). While it is well established that under mild to moderate stress, droughtinduced reductions in photosynthesis are mainly due to diffusive limitations-i.e. decreased stomatal and mesophyll conductance- (Chaves et al. 2002;Flexas and Medrano, 2002), there is less of a consensus about the limiting process when drought intensity is increased. Similarly, there is much less information on the limitations to photosynthesis recovery by severely stressed plants when water is restored (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007b;Gall\u00e9 et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Current atmospheric CO 2 concentration is well below saturating for photosynthesis, so the metabolic rate that limits photosynthesis in the majority of plants is carboxylation by Rubisco rather than electron transport or RuBP regeneration, although sometimes a co-limitation of both metabolic components has been suggested (Lambers et al., 2008). Under drought, CO 2 availability in leaves is further reduced because of stomatal closure, hence leading plants to operate in a CO 2 range where Rubisco carboxylation is the sole metabolic rate limiting photosynthesis. Therefore, despite claims that drought impairs chloroplast ATP synthesis and RuBP regeneration (Tezara et al., 1999), if any metabolic limitation occurs under drought this is very likely to be mediated by Rubisco activity (Flexas et al., 2004;Grassi and Magnani, 2005). Rubisco activity can be estimated by calculations from in vitro and/or in vivo measurements (von Caemmerer, 2000). Estimates from in vivo measurements are based on the assumptions of the Farquhar model adapted to finite g m -i.e. calculation of the initial slope of the A N -C c curve or V c,max - (Farquhar et al., 1980;Niinemets et al., 2009), and usually show that the carboxylation capacity is preserved until water stress becomes severe (Bota et al., 2004;Grassi and Magnani, 2005;Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007b;Gall\u00e9 et al., 2009). On the contrary, inconsistencies arise from in vitro measurements concerning the metabolic impairment of photosynthesis, and particularly of Rubisco activity, under drought. The reported effects of water stress on the activity of Rubisco differ between reports, precluding a definitive conclusion. Hence, observed effects range from major reductions of Rubisco activity (Majumdar et al., 1991;Maroco et al., 2002;Parry et al., 2002), to minor decreases (Flexas et al., 2006), and even no effect at all (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 1992;Gunasekera and Berkowitz, 1993;Lal et al., 1996;Pankovic et al., 1999;Delfine et al., 2001;Pelloux et al., 2001). This apparent controversy may be attributed to differences in the intensity of drought (Flexas et al., 2006). Alternatively, it may arise from interspecific differences, but there are studies reporting contradictory effects of water stress on Rubisco activity for the same species. For instance, Parry et al. (2002) showed, in tobacco plants, that downregulation of Rubisco activity occurred concomitantly with decreases in the leaf relative water content (RWC), while Flexas et al. (2006) found no correlation between these parameters also in tobacco. In an attempt to explain such discrepancies, Flexas et al. (2004) demonstrated that differences between species disappeared when Rubisco activity was plotted against stomatal conductance (g s ) rather than RWC. However, a direct relationship between g s and Rubisco activity is unlikely. It is possible, though, that this observation might be due to an indirect effect, related to the influence of g s on the CO 2 concentration in leaves which, in turn, also depends on the rate of assimilation, controlled by Rubisco activity (Flexas et al., 2004).",

An inverse correlation between the carbamylation state and Rubisco concentration has been reported (Quick et al., 1991;Ruuska et al., 1998;Eichelmann et al., 2009). Changes in the concentration of Rubisco have been observed under water stress (e.g. Holaday et al., 1992), but even in this situation Rubisco concentration is considered to be present sufficiently in excess not to limit photosynthesis (Pickersgill, 1986;Warren and Adams, 2004). Increases in Rubisco tight-binding inhibitors have also been reported under conditions of water shortage, although this has not been firmly established (Parry et al., 2002). Therefore, adjustments of Rubisco activity under water stress are mainly attributed to changes in the carbamylation and activation state. In situations where light is saturating and leaf conductance does not limit CO 2 supply (i.e. in the absence of stress), the activation state of Rubisco is maximum (Sage et al., 1990). However, water stress, through changes in g s and g m , induces a decrease in the concentration of CO 2 in leaves and therefore in the amount of activator CO 2 bound by carbamylation to Rubisco. Deactivation of Rubisco by loss of the carbamate complex in the active site has been observed at substomatal CO 2 concentrations (C i ) of <100 lmol mol \u00c01 in some species, but not in others (Perchorowicz and Jensen, 1983;von Caemmerer and Edmondson, 1986;Sage et al., 1990). This threshold of internal CO 2 concentration coincides roughly with the threshold of chloroplastic CO 2 concentration (C c ) inducing decreases in in vivo V c,max in several species (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007b) and in vitro Rubisco activity in tobacco and soybean (Flexas et al., 2006). Overall, this evidence suggests that drought-driven effects on Rubisco activity are caused by CO 2 starvation and its consequent de-carbamylation of the Rubisco catalytic sites. Therefore, a survey relating Rubisco activity and C c for a larger number of species subjected to gradual imposition of water stress and recovery is justified and would help in defining the causes of metabolic limitation of photosynthesis under drought.",

Incomplete extraction of Rubisco, prior to activity analysis, has been shown to be responsible for inadequate activity to support photosynthetic rates measured by gas exchange in loblolly pine (Rogers et al., 2001). Rubisco extractions from leaves are often incomplete even when care is taken to prevent inactivation and precipitation by high contents of phenolic or other secondary compounds (Beadle et al., 1983;Keys and Parry, 1990). There are also inaccuracies in estimating Rubisco activity from in vivo measurements of gas exchange in leaves and especially in the determination of g m needed for the model used. The combined gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence methods for calculating g m rely on the estimation of parameters requiring a number of assumptions and subject to technical limitations, which become relatively more important in certain groups of species, like sclerophylls, with leaves covered by hairs, and in heterobaric leaves (Flexas et al., 2008;Pons et al., 2009). Despite these difficulties, qualitative relationships of photosynthetic activity can be seen between in vitro and in vivo estimates.",

            "text": "All species showed a progressive decline in the Rubisco initial activity as water stress intensified, starting at MiWS, except for the two Beta spp. (Fig. 1). Rubisco activation state followed a slightly different pattern, maintaining values similar to those in irrigated plants under MiWS to MoWS, depending on the species, and declining under SeWS (Fig. 1). This trend is illustrated by the biphasic relationship between activation state and initial activity (Fig. 2), with an initial phase where activation state remains constant while initial activity decreases followed by a second phase where decreases in both parameters occurred concurrently. This fact suggests that under MiWS to MoWS, decreases in Rubisco activity are mainly due to decreases in the concentration of Rubisco reaction sites (i.e. initial and total Rubisco activity decrease concomitantly), either due to decreases in the enzyme concentration or to increases in the inhibitors bound to the sites of reaction. Early droughtinduced losses of Rubisco have been reported by both transcriptomic (Kawaguchi et al., 2003) and proteomic approaches (Holaday et al., 1992), although increases have also been reported in some species (Cramer et al., 2007;Vincent et al., 2007). The species selected in this study, although inhabiting contrasting environments, are typically Mediterranean, and therefore adapted to frequent but unpredictable drought events (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007a). Moreover, due to their relatively low g s and g m (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007a), they often present C c values close to or below the threshold of 100 lmol mol \u00c01 , i.e. they operate normally close to conditions favourable for Rubisco inactivation (Perchorowicz and Jensen, 1983). Among potentially advantageous adaptations to such stress conditions, interactions of Rubisco with tight-binding inhibitors would prevent Rubisco that is not being used for catalysis from being degraded by proteases (Parry et al., 2008). Thereafter, at MoWS to SeWS, deactivation of Rubisco becomes the predominant cause for decreased Rubisco activity, in agreement with previous reports (Sharkey and Seemann, 1989). When exposed to severe water stress, many plants accumulate osmolytes, such as proline, glycine betaine, and sugar alcohols (Yoshiba et al., 1997). In vitro analyses demonstrate that high concentrations of these osmolytes have potential to curtail the activity of Rubisco (Sivakumar et al., 1998;Sivakumar et al., 2002). Therefore, the observed decrease in Rubisco activity at SeWS could be, at least partially, due to the accumulation of osmolytes.",

On the other hand, it is also documented that the effectiveness of Rubisco extraction and assay procedures is dependent on the presence of phenols and other secondary metabolites (Beadle et al., 1983;Keys and Parry, 1990), which varies depending on the species and stress conditions (Turtola et al., 2003;Andr\u00e9 et al., 2009). This fact could explain differences in the slope of the relationship between Rubisco initial activity and V c,max between species (Fig. 3).",

Alternatively, it may be argued that the estimation of V c,max might be biased, due to the multiple assumptions included in its calculation. To test this possibility, it may be necessary to compare Rubisco activity values with some in vivo parameter, such as the ETR, which is more straightforward to determine. A 'photosynthetic control' exists in leaves where the balance between DpH, ATP synthesis, and redox state adjust supply to demand so that the [ATP]/ [ADP] and [NADPH]/[NADP + ] ratios are remarkably constant in steady-state conditions (Foyer et al., 1990). Therefore, it is likely that the rate of electron transport in the thylakoids and Rubisco activity in the stroma are coregulated, and therefore ETR would indirectly reflect  variations in Rubisco activity. ETR is indeed co-regulated with V c,max in Mediterranean species (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007a), and its use in place of V c,max as a proxy for metabolic limitation results in very similar estimations of the latter under water stress (Gall\u00e9 et al., 2009). In the present study, initial activity of Rubisco was highly correlated with ETR ( Fig. 4A), as it was with the CO 2 net assimilation rate (A N ) (Fig. 4B). These results confirm that despite potential activity losses during extraction, in vitro measurements of Rubisco activity were proportional to in vivo measurements and qualitatively representative of what occurs in vivo. Although the relationship between Rubisco initial activity and A N was linear when plotting all species together (Fig. 4B), it was logarithmic for 6 of the 11 species when considered individually (data not shown). In particular, some of the species with larger maximum A N and g s display a logarithmic response, while evergreen sclerophylls spanning a shorter range of values display a linear response. This could be related to the fact that the latter, due to lower maximum g s and g m , operate always at C c below the general inflexion point for Rubisco inactivation (see next section).",

            "text": "Rubisco initial activity and activation state did not correlate with the substomatal CO 2 concentration (C i ) (Fig. 6A, C). In fact, maximum values for initial activity and activation state were observed at intermediate C i values, perhaps reflecting the typical response of C i to drought consisting in decreases at mild to moderate stress followed by increases at more severe stress (Medrano et al., 2002). By contrast, when plotting Rubisco initial activity and activation state against C c , significant correlations were observed (Fig. 6B, D). As occurred with RWC PD , the relationships between Rubisco initial activity and C c and between activation state and C c , presented an important scattering when plotting all species together. However, the regression coefficients generally improved when considering each species individually, being always higher than those with RWC PD (Table 2). By breaking the covariation between g s and RWC, Flexas et al. (2006) observed that down-regulation of Rubisco activity was not dependent on RWC, but occurred at a certain threshold of g s (<0.05 mol m \u00c02 s \u00c01 ) and C c (<100 lmol mol \u00c01 ), although the relationship between Rubisco activity and C c was less clear. In the present study, Rubisco initial activity correlated, at P < 0.05, with RWC for three species, and with C c for nine species (Table 2). A similar trend was observed for the activation state (Table 2). It is worth noting that RW values were not consistent with the relationship in several species. Remarkably, the poorest correlations were found in shrubs (H. balearicum, P. lentiscus, C. albidus, and P. italica), with higher leaf mass per area (LMA), while in all herbaceous (D. ibicensis, L. minoricensis, B. maritima ssp. marcosii, and B. maritima ssp. maritima), and semi-shrub (L. magallufianum and L. gibertii) species both Rubisco initial activity and its activation state significantly correlated with C c . In general, these data demonstrate that regulation of Rubisco activity is more related to CO 2 availability in the vicinity of the enzyme than to leaf hydration status. Species-dependent patterns of Rubisco activity regulation under drought stress have previously been documented (Parry et al., 2002;Bota et al., 2004;Flexas et al., 2006).",

Previously, in vivo Rubisco deactivation was observed at C i <100 lmol mol \u00c01 in several species, e.g. Chenopodium albus, Raphanus sativus, Triticum aestivum, and Phaseolus vulgaris (Perchorowicz and Jensen, 1983;von Caemmerer and Edmondson, 1986;Sage et al., 1990;Sage et al., 2002). The K act [CO 2 ], i.e. the CO 2 concentration that  supports half of the maximal activation has been reported to be 120 lmol mol \u00c01 for in vitro systems with activase (Portis et al., 1986). Sage et al. (2002) suggested that in vivo K act [CO 2 ] is probably <60 lmol mol \u00c01 . In agreement with this suggestion, in the present study Rubisco activation started to decline at C c below ;120 lmol mol \u00c01 (Fig. 6D). At this low C c , the equilibrium between carbamylated and decarbamylated Rubisco will shift towards the latter form. The major aim of the present study was to find global relationships between Rubisco activity and physiology under drought using several species pooled. However, it is clear that species belonging to very different growth forms and leaf habitats, even if they all often experience drought in their natural environments, undergo different average operational and maximum C c . For instance, evergreen sclerophylls show the lowest stomatal and mesophyll conductance even under irrigation (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2007b), and therefore the lowest maximum C c (Fig. 7, light-grey and empty symbols). Perennial and annual herbs, as well as semi-deciduous species, present much larger g s and g m when irrigated, and therefore experience larger C c (Fig. 7, black and dark-grey symbols). These differential features may induce differences in Rubisco between species. Indeed, Galm\u00e9s et al. (2005) showed that Rubisco specificity factor positively scaled with sclerophylly, i.e. it was larger in species with lower g s and g m . It is shown here (Fig. 6D), as in Perchorowitz and Jensen (1983) and Flexas et al. (2006) that, globally, inactivation of Rubisco is induced by a C c of <100 lmol mol \u00c01 . However, due to their intrinsic leaf morphology and physiology, evergreen species always operate at C c <100 lmol mol \u00c01 , even with stomata fully open (Fig. 7), while herbs and semi-deciduous plants present maximum C c values of between 130 and 200 lmol mol \u00c01 , operating at lower C c only when subjected to drought. This seems to have induced evolutionary differences at the level of Rubisco activation sensitivity to C c . Hence, even when in all species the inflexion point for Rubisco inactivation is at a C c of ;100640 lmol mol \u00c01 (Fig. 6), there is a linear correlation between the maximum operational C c and the actual value of C c at the inflexion point for Rubisco inactivation (Fig. 7).",

            "text": "These results suggest that those species adapted to low C c,max are able to maintain active Rubisco at lower C c . One possible explanation could be that Rubisco from these species has an intrinsically lower K act [CO 2 ]. Another possibility is that Rubisco activase is more active or present in higher concentrations in these species. Higher concentration and/or activation of Rubisco activase would improve removal of RuBP and other tightly bound sugar phosphates from the sites of reaction (Portis et al., 2008). Finally, formation of sideproducts, such as xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate and pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate, from the enediol intermediate during Rubisco catalysis can progressively inhibit Rubisco turnover. Pearce (2006) demonstrated that the rate of production of these side-products increased when the [CO 2 ]/[O 2 ] ratio decreased, and such decreases occur under water stress (Galm\u00e9s et al., 2006). In consequence, differences in C c,ip may be caused by a lower rate of formation of side-products at a given C c for species with lower C c,ip . In addition, Pearce (2006) also suggested that species with a higher specificity factor produce relatively fewer side-products, and Galm\u00e9s et al. (2005) observed, by studying these same species included in the present work, that Rubisco specificity factor tended to be higher in species with sclerophyll leaves (and therefore lower C c,ip ). Differences among species and groups in Rubisco responses to drought will deserve better attention in future studies.",

Decreases in both Rubisco initial activity and its activation correlated better with changes in stomatal conductance than with changes in relative water content. Since a direct effect of stomatal conductance on Rubisco is unlikely, we suggest that the effect is mediated by decreases in CO 2 availability induced by lower stomatal and mesophyll conductance, rather than by increases in leaf dehydration. In fact, both Rubisco initial activity, and especially, Rubisco activation, showed a threshold relationship with in vivo estimated C c that matches theoretical values obtained from in vitro studies. While there are some differences between species in the precise C c threshold value so that species with low g s and thick leaves are able to maintain carbamylated Rubisco at lower values of C c , evergreen sclerophyll species operate most of their life below that threshold, due to low maximum g s and g m even when water is available. In herbs and semi-deciduous species, the threshold is often reached during the frequent droughts occurring in the Mediterranean.",
