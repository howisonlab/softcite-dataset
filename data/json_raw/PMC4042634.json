In response, the host secretes siderophorebinding proteins, such as lipocalin 24p3, which limit siderophore-mediated iron import into bacteria. Mammals produce 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid, a compound that resembles a bacterial siderophore. Our data suggest that bacteria use both mammalian and bacterial siderophores. In support of this idea, supplementation with mammalian siderophore enhances bacterial growth in vitro. In addition, mice lacking the mammalian siderophore resist E. coli infection. Finally, we show that the host responds to infection by suppressing siderophore synthesis while up-regulating lipocalin 24p3 expression via TLR signaling. Thus, reciprocal regulation of 24p3 and mammalian siderophore is a protective mechanism limiting microbial access to iron.",

            "text": "The growth and metabolism of many pathogenic microbes is exquisitely iron sensitive (Schaible and Kaufmann, 2004). Mammals have evolved a defense mechanism to sequester iron that permits host cells to maintain access to iron while preventing invading microbes from acquiring the metal (Ganz, 2009;Cassat and Skaar, 2013). Iron is predominantly intracellular or tightly bound to proteins. Invading pathogens therefore obtain iron from their host by secreting small, iron-binding siderophores, which remove iron from host protein-iron complexes due to their higher affinity for iron (Miethke and Marahiel, 2007). In parallel, mammals have evolved siderophore-binding proteins as components of the innate immune system, e.g., 24p3 (Flo et al., 2004). 24p3 is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that transport a variety of ligands (Flower, 2000). 24p3 binds small hydrophobic molecules, the siderophores (Goetz et al., 2002). By binding iron-laden bacterial siderophores, 24p3 participates in innate host defense (Flo et al., 2004;Berger et al., 2006;Saiga et al., 2008). 24p3 expression in innate immunity is highly induced in response to stimulation by TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 agonists (Flo et al., 2004;Saiga et al., 2008;Van Maele et al., 2010). 24p3 is also one of the secondary granule proteins of neutrophils (Kjeldsen et al., 1993). Therefore, the 24p3 released upon neutrophil degranulation, complements 24p3 secreted by TLR stimulated macrophages, epithelial cells and liver opposing salvage of host iron by bacterial siderophores (Borregaard and Cowland, 2006). 24p3 specifically binds catecholate or mixed phenolate type siderophores (Holmes et al., 2005). The ability of 24p3 to curtail the growth of bacteria is limited to those species that depend on catecholes and mixed phenolates for iron acquisition (Berger et al., 2006, Flo et al., 2004Saiga et al., 2008). Strains of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus have modified siderophores that evade capture by 24p3 (Fischbach et al., 2006). Moreover, pathogenic strains of E. coli secrete multiple siderophores (Henderson et al., 2009). Although 24p3 is highly induced by infection with these , E. coli W3110 mut aroB (B), E. coli W3110\ue044FepA (C) or E. coli W3110\ue044FepA/\ue044aroB (D; 10 4 CFU/ml each) was cultured in the presence of the indicated amounts of 2,5-DHBA, 2,3-DHBA, or benzoic acid overnight and CFU were determined at 12 h after culture.

(K) DHBA supplementation has no effect on S. aureus growth. S. aureus strain 25923 at 10 5 CFU/ml was cultured in the presence of indicated amounts of 2,5-DHBA, 2,3-DHBA, or benzoic acid overnight and CFU were determined at 12 h after culture by plating onto tryptic soy agar plates. Data are the means of three independent experiments \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis by RESULTS 2,5-DHBA, the mammalian siderophore augments bacterial growth in vitro Previously, both 2,3-DHBA and enterobactin were shown to confer a growth advantage to E. coli by promoting iron uptake (Hancock et al., 1977). The mammalian siderophore, 2,5-DHBA, resembles 2,3-DHBA, so we reasoned that 2,5-DHBA may also promote bacterial growth. We tested this hypothesis using an E. coli strain harboring a mutation in the aroB gene (W3110 mut aroB) whose gene product catalyzes one of the early steps in the shikimate pathway preventing enterobactin synthesis (Braun et al., 1983;Chaudhuri et al., 1986;Bentley, 1990). In iron-restrictive medium (RPMI), the aroB mutant grows poorly compared with the parental E. coli W3110 strain (Braun et al., 1983). As expected, addition of 2,3-DHBA augmented growth of the aroB mutant ( Fig. 1 B). The growth promoting activity of 2,3-DHBA on the aroB mutant is less effective than that observed in parental E. coli W3110 (Fig. 1 A). However, 2,5-DHBA also augmented the growth of the aroB mutant in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Supplementation with 2,5-DHBA augmented the growth of parental W3110 strain, although less efficiently than 2,3-DHBA ( Fig. 1 A). In contrast, addition of benzoic acid, a chemical paralogue of 2,5-DHBA, had a minimal effect on the growth of both parental or aroB mutant E. coli strains (Fig. 1 B). Thus, supplementation with 2,5-DHBA rescues the growth deficit caused by the absence of enterobactin.",

Interestingly, 24p3 is also highly induced by E. coli infection of C3H/HeJ mice that harbor a mutation in TLR4 (Reigstad et al., 2007). Despite high levels of 24p3, these mice succumb to E. coli infection; the effect of 24p3 on E. coli growth in C3H/HeJ mice is insignificant (Hagberg et al., 1985). As stated above, 24p3 is a secondary granule protein in neutrophils, which is critical for motility and chemotaxis (Rathore et al., 2011;Schroll et al., 2012;Liu et al., 2013). 24p3 deficiency confers enhanced sensitivity upon mice to a variety of pathogens independent of their ability to secrete siderophores (Liu et al., 2013).

However, these molecules were not implicated in iron carrier function of 24p3. Using 24p3 as bait we recently identified a siderophore in mammalian cells that facilitates iron loading onto 24p3 (Devireddy et al., 2010). The mammalian siderophore, 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,5-DHBA) is chemically similar to 2,3-DHBA, the iron-binding moiety of E. coli enterobactin (Raymond et al., 2003). One of the short chain dehydrogenases (SDR) family of reductases, 3-OH butyrate dehydrogenase-2 (Bdh2), a homologue of bacterial EntA, catalyzes a rate-limiting step in the 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHBA) biosynthetic pathway (Devireddy et al., 2010).",

Due to its similarity to bacterial siderophore, we hypothesized that the mammalian siderophore promotes bacterial growth. We now show that the mammalian siderophore augments bacterial growth and can rescue a growth deficit conferred by the absence of the E. coli siderophore, enterobactin. To counter bacterial coopting of the mammalian siderophore, the host responds by suppressing mammalian siderophore biosynthesis. Thus, negative regulation of the mammalian siderophore provides an ingenious strategy to withhold iron from invading pathogens. Of note, mammalian siderophore-deficient mice resist pathogenic E. coli. In addition to decreasing mammalian siderophore the host responds by secreting 24p3 to sequester iron-laden bacterial siderophores. Thus, reciprocal regulation of 24p3 and the mammalian siderophore restricts the growth of invading pathogens.",

Based on a computational model, Bdh2 was assumed to bind and oxidize cytosolic ketone bodies (Guo et al., 2006). Therefore, we evaluated levels of ketone bodies in plasma samples obtained from WT and bdh2-null mice, specifically 3 hydroxybutyric acid, the most abundant ketone in the body. WT mice displayed basal levels of 3 hydroxybutyric acid (Fig. 2 C). Surprisingly, 3 hydroxybutyric acid levels in bdh2-null mice were comparable to WT mice (Fig. 2 C). Further evaluation of acetoacetate also suggested no ketoacidosis in bdh2-null mice (Fig. 2 D).",

            "text": "In mammals, ketone bodies are derived from the oxidation of fatty acids that are then exported to other tissues to be used as fuel (Cotter et al., 2013). Therefore, we assessed cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFA), and triglyceride levels in plasma samples from WT and bdh2-null mice. Plasma fatty acid levels were unremarkable in bdh2-null mice compared with the levels in WT mice (Fig. 2, E-G). In addition, because glucose metabolism and ketone body oxidation are linked, we assessed glucose handling in bdh2-null mice after overnight fasting. No significant difference was observed between WT and bdh2-null mice (unpublished data). Thus, Bdh2 deficiency does not appear to impair ketone body metabolism. two molecules may result from enhanced uptake of iron mediated by 2,3-DHBA or 2,5-DHBA. We assessed growth rates of the aroB mutant under iron-replete condition with or without 2,5-DHBA and, as a control, 2,3-DHBA to test this idea (Fig. 1, E and F). Exogenous supplementation with ferric iron alone conferred a marginal growth advantage when compared with medium alone (Fig. 1, E and F). However, addition of iron complexed with 2,5-DHBA or 2,3-DHBA substantially enhanced the growth of the aroB mutant strain (Fig. 1, E and F). Radiolabeled iron uptake experiments with or without 2,5-DHBA or 2,3-DHBA or benzoic acid as a control confirmed this result (unpublished data). Substitution of iron with chromium (another d-block transition metal) in the 2,5-DHBA-ferric iron complex did not further enhance the growth of the aroB mutant ( Fig. 1 G). These results suggest that 2,5-DHBA confers a growth advantage on the aroB mutant by facilitating iron uptake.",

Addition of 2,5-DHBA augmented the growth of E. coli strain H9049 (Fig. 1 H), whereas addition of benzoic acid had no effect (Fig. 1 H). As expected, addition of 2,3-DHBA also augmented growth ( Fig. 1 H). We next assessed E. coli H9049 strain growth under iron-replete conditions with or without 2,5-DHBA or 2,3-DHBA as a positive control. Exogenous supplementation with ferric iron conferred a marginal growth advantage (Fig. 1,  I and J). However, addition of 2,5-DHBA or 2,3-DHBA in the presence of ferric iron significantly enhanced E. coli H9049 growth compared with iron or 2,5-DHBA alone (Fig. 1, I and J).

The catalytic activity of Bdh2 is dependent on NPG and SYK motifs, which are encoded by exon 7 (Guo et al., 2006). We replaced exon 7 of the bdh2 gene with a neomycin resistance cassette (Fig. 2 A). By interbreeding bdh2 heterozygous mice, H9049 applies to other pathogenic E. coli we used the E. coli 25922 strain, which secretes both enterobactin and aerobactin (Berger et al., 2006). 2,5-DHBA deficiency also conferred resistance to E. coli 25922 challenge, supporting the generality of resistance to bacterial infections conferred by absence of BDH2 ( Fig. 3 B). \ue07a20% of E. coli 25922-infected bdh2-null mice recovered from infection, whereas none of the infected WT mice survived (Fig. 3 B). The number of bdh2-null mice that recovered from E. coli 25922 challenge is lower than the number that recovered from E. coli H9049 challenge (Fig. 3, A and B). The difference in recovery may result from the secretion of additional siderophores by E. coli 25922 making them less dependent on 2,5-DHBA for iron uptake. Bacterial loads in E. coli 25922-infected mice are also lower than in WT mice (unpublished data). The E. coli challenge experiments demonstrate that 2,5-DHBA deficiency hampers growth of E. coli in vivo and confers resistance to mice.",

As expected, IL-1\ue062, IL-12b, IL-10, IFN-\ue067, and TNF were increased in a quantitative real-time PCR assay after LPS or E. coli challenge in WT mice (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, bdh2 deficiency only affected the expression of IFN-\ue067, under similar conditions (Fig. 5 A). Further, IFN-\ue067 levels were also induced by challenge with PAM3-CSK4, a TLR2 agonist (not depicted). Observation of enhanced IFN-\ue067 in bdh2-null mice upon stimulation with TLR ligands is significant because IFN-\ue067 limits the availability of iron in macrophages (Nairz et al., 2008).

Engagement of TLRs by cognate ligands leads to inflammatory and innate immune responses. Mammalian siderophore-deficient mice are resistant to bacterial infections suggesting that the siderophore participates in the innate immune response. We assessed TLR-mediated mammalian siderophore expression in immune cells by determining levels of bdh2 mRNA and protein in cultured naive macrophages (RAW264.7), as well as in macrophages stimulated with TLR agonists. As expected, cultured naive macrophages showed abundant transcription of bdh2 mRNA (Fig. 6 A). However, bdh2 mRNA was reduced S. aureus-challenged WT and bdh2-null mice were similar (not depicted). These results show that 2,5-DHBA deficiency does not alter sensitivity to S. aureus. C. albicans does not express FepA and is unaffected by 2,5-DHBA supplementation (Almeida et al., 2009). Based on this observation, we reasoned that bdh2-null mice might not display altered sensitivity to C. albicans. Bdh2-null mice react very similarly to WT mice after C. albicans inoculation (Fig. 3 G). As with S. aureus, the microbial load in WT and bdh2-null mice are comparable (not depicted). Together these results suggest that bdh2-null mice are neither sensitive nor resistant to C. albicans challenge.",

The bacterial burden in the lungs of M. tuberculosis infected bdh2-null mice 4 and 20 wk after infection was initially very low in bdh2-null mice as compared with WT mice; however, at later stages of infection, the CFU titers were similar to those observed in WT mice (Fig. 3 J). Histological analysis of lungs of infected WT and bdh2-null mice at 28 d after infection revealed changes suggestive of an inflammatory response, which was exacerbated in bdh2-null mice (Fig. 3 I).

Interestingly, S. aureus infection also repressed bdh2 and lowered 2,5-DHBA levels, whereas 24p3 levels were higher (Fig. 6, G-J). 2,5-DHBA supplementation does not alter S. aureus growth and bdh2-null mice display phenotypic characteristics comparable to WT mice upon S. aureus challenge (Figs. 1 and 3). The significance of bdh2 repression in S. aureuschallenged mice is currently unknown.

Because TLR-mediated gene regulation occurs predominantly via transcriptional regulation, we examined treatment (Aung et al., 2006). Therefore, the observed repression of bdh2 may be secondary to autocrine effects of cytokines. To test this possibility, we performed a kinetic analysis of bdh2 levels in macrophages stimulated with LPS. We first detected repression of bdh2 1 h after LPS treatment, which preceded detection of cytokines in the medium (Fig. 6 C). Addition of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, to LPS-treated macrophages resulted in a decrease in bdh2 expression, but inhibited synthesis and secretion of IL-6, one of the major cytokines induced by LPS (Fig. 6 D;  Akira et al., 1993). However, repression of bdh2 in cycloheximide + LPS-treated cells is moderate compared with cells treated with LPS alone (Fig. 6 D). Because cycloheximide treatment inhibits global protein synthesis, this would include transcription factors that repress bdh2 (see below). Finally, to directly test the regulatory role of cytokines on bdh2 expression, we treated macrophages with recombinant cytokines and analyzed bdh2 expression. We found that most cytokines had no effect on bdh2 expression ( Fig. 6 E). Collectively, these results suggest that bdh2 is regulated directly by LPS.",

Statistical analysis To rigorously test the role of Blimp-1 in LPS-mediated repression of bdh2, we suppressed endogenous Blimp-1 in LPStreated RAW264.7 macrophages by RNAi-mediated silencing. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis suggested down-regulation of blimp-1 in LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells (not depicted). We also confirmed these results by performing immunoblot analysis using an anti-Blimp-1 antibody. We first analyzed endogenous bdh2 message in blimp-1 silenced RAW264.7 cells that were stimulated with LPS. Bdh2 mRNA levels were unaltered despite LPS treatment in blimp-1 knock down cells (Fig. 6 N). Next, we transfected a bdh2-luc reporter into blimp-1-silenced, LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells. In agreement with the results of Fig. 6 N, Blimp-1 deficiency abrogates LPS-mediated repression of bdh2 (Fig. 6 O). Together, these results confirm that Blimp-1 mediates LPS-induced repression of bdh2.",

Hepcidinindependent mechanisms also regulate ferroportin (Deschemin and Vaulont, 2013). Inactivation of ferroportin by hepcidin leads to intracellular iron retention (Nemeth et al., 2004). We therefore assessed the levels of hepcidin and ferroportin in liver and spleen samples, respectively, from uninfected as well the motifs in the promoter region of bdh2 that confer TLRdependent down-regulation. We initially analyzed transcriptional regulation of the bdh2 gene in naive RAW264.7 macrophages. A 5\ue039-RACE PCR identified the transcription start site \ue07a25 bp downstream of a TATA box (Fig. 6 L). We then cloned the 5\ue039-flanking region spanning \ue0325 kb to + 0.5 kb relative to the transcription start site into a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. Constitutive reporter gene activity was detectable in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6 L). Consistent with endogenous bdh2 mRNA expression, stimulation of RAW264.7 cells via the TLR4 pathway significantly reduced luciferase activity (Fig. 6 L). To identify the cis-acting DNA elements that confer TLR-dependent regulation on bdh2, we constructed progressive 5\ue039 deletion mutants of the bdh2 promoter and analyzed their activity (Fig. 6 L). All the mutants retained basal activity in naive macrophages (Fig. 6 L). However, TLR-mediated repression of luciferase activity was lost when a deletion from \ue0321.5 kb to \ue0321 kb bp was analyzed, indicating positive cis-acting regulatory elements in this region ( Fig. 6 L).",

Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor that recruits histone deacetylases, histone lysine/arginine methyltransferases, and co-repressors to induce promoter silencing (John and Garrett-Sinha, 2009). The Blimp-1-binding motif closest to the transcription start site bears significant homology to the consensus sequence (Fig. 6 L). Significantly, Blimp-1 is induced by LPS and mediates silencing of dependent promoters in a TLR-dependent manner (Lord et al., 2009). Thus, Blimp-1 may suppress bdh2 expression. To test this possibility, we mutated the two Blimp-1-binding sites in the mouse bdh2 promoter. Stimulation with LPS failed to repress the bdh2 promoter bearing mutations in both the Blimp-1-binding sites, indicating that Blimp-1-binding sites mediate LPS repression of the bdh2 promoter (Fig. 6 M).",

Several lines of evidence suggest that Bdh2 may be dispensable for oxidation of ketone bodies: 1) Bdh2 deficiency does not alter ketone body levels; 2) cytosolic Bdh2 is only 20% identical to Bdh1, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in NAD + / NADPH-dependent oxidation/reduction of ketone bodies (Guo et al., 2006;Cotter et al., 2013); 3) a majority of ketone bodies are ferried into mitochondria to fuel energy reactions.

For instance, IRAK-M, an inhibitor of IRAK-1 signaling, is induced by LPS treatment to promote tolerance to future LPS challenges (van 't Veer et al., 2007). Blimp-1 is another LPS-induced transcription factor that down-regulates downstream targets, perhaps to induce a full inflammatory response (John and Garrett-Sinha, 2009). So, what is the significance of bdh2 down-regulation by Blimp-1? Based on our findings, we hypothesize that bdh2 is present before immune stimulation, but that during infection its expression is reduced to prevent bacterial utilization of 2,5-DHBA for iron scavenging. We provided further mechanistic detail by showing that Blimp-1 is the major factor that confers LPS-mediated transcriptional repression of bdh2. Other factors may also play a role in the LPS-mediated down-regulation of bdh2. For example, LPS treatment differentially affects a set of miRNAs whose function is to change inflammatory status (Tili et al., 2007). Finally, down-regulation of bdh2 in S. aureusinfected mice suggests additional regulatory mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.",

Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis: (1) we found that bdh2-null mice accumulate iron in the spleen and to a limited extent in liver (unpublished data); and (2) macrophages recycle heme from senescent RBC and store iron in ferritin, which is directed to the lysosomal pathway to meet cellular demands for iron. Ferroportin regulates iron egress from macrophages into the circulation (Delaby et al., 2005). Free heme is very toxic, and lack of the antioxidant 2,5-DHBA (Joshi et al., 2012) leads to a nonenzymatic destruction of heme, removing iron from its normal path toward ferroportin.

The reciprocal regulation of 24p3 and bdh2 by TLR4 agonist serves two purposes: (1) down-regulation of the mammalian siderophore allows 24p3 to bind only the siderophores secreted by invading pathogens because 24p3 binds both mammalian and bacterial siderophores (Holmes et al., 2005;Devireddy et al., 2010), thus maximizing the sequestering activity of 24p3; and (2) because 2,5-DHBA augments E. coli growth, suppression of 2,5-DHBA by TLR signaling deprives the bacteria of the added growth advantage conferred by 2,5-DHBA.

Our current results confirm that cytosolic Bdh2 is important for 2,5-DHBA synthesis and that Bdh2 is not involved in ketone body metabolism: first, mammalian Bdh2 is highly homologous to bacterial EntA (>45% similarity and \ue07a31% identical; Devireddy et al., 2010), which oxidizes 2,3-dihydro 2,3-DHBA to 2,3-DHBA. The high degree of homology suggests that the major function of Bdh2 is DHBA synthesis; second, in agreement with the above prediction, we showed that the absence of Bdh2 abrogates 2,5-DHBA biosynthesis both in vivo and in cultured cells (Devireddy et al., 2010; this study); third, contrary to the purported function based on a computational study (Guo et al., 2006), ketone body levels are unchanged in bdh2-null mice; finally, the absence of bdh2 results in alterations in cellular iron metabolism both in vivo and in cell culture models (Devireddy et al., 2010). All of these results strongly support a role for Bdh2 in the synthesis of 2,5-DHBA in mice.",

(1980), very little is known about the small molecular weight iron binding molecules in mammalian tissues or their interaction with bacteria. Further, the role of these compounds in 24p3mediated host defense remains elusive. This report supports the hypothesis that mammalian siderophore-like molecules augment bacterial growth by facilitating iron import into bacteria. Bacteria secrete a variety of siderophores to acquire iron from the host. However, the secreted siderophores are hijacked by a variety of host-derived proteins, e.g., 24p3. In this regard, 2,5-DHBA, which is ubiquitous, may serve as an alternative source for invading pathogens to obtain iron. To counter the hijacking of 2,5-DHBA, the host suppresses bdh2 expression thus depriving the bacteria the added opportunity presented by 2,5-DHBA. Additionally, serum iron levels are lower in bdh2-null mice (unpublished data). The combined effects of lower serum iron and the absence of 2,5-DHBA provide an effective response by the host. Unlike 2,5-DHBA, catechol adversely affects growth of bacteria via an unknown mechanism (Park et al., 2001); the function of the catechol-24p3 complex in host defense is unclear.",

We found that IFN-\ue067 was differentially regulated in macrophages of bdh2-null mice upon challenge with E. coli, but not with LPS. Although the major antigenic determinant of E. coli is LPS, we did not observe altered IFN-\ue067 in response to LPS challenge. The basis for this discrepancy is unclear, but it is possible that active replication of E. coli may be necessary to alter IFN-\ue067 in bdh2-null mice. High levels of IFN-\ue067 alter intracellular iron homeostasis in macrophages and promote intracellular defenses against invading pathogens (Gordon et al., 2005). Therefore, higher levels of IFN-\ue067 in bdh2-null mice may in part explain the decrease in M. tuberculosis replication in bdh2-null mice.",

Additionally, amino acid residues encoded by exon 7 of bdh2 form a helix, which is located at a dimer interface within the tetramer (Guo et al., 2006). So removal of this stretch of helices prevents proper dimer/tetramer formation and within this helical stretch of residues are 3 aa, which form the active site: Tyr147 and Lys151 interact with the bound NAD + cofactor and Arg144 interacts with a sulfate in the active site (Guo et al., 2006). Thus, removal of amino acids, which are coded by exon 7, results in abrogation of the enzymatic activity of Bdh2 and also destabilizes the structure of Bdh2.
