This paper attempts to explore a look at how cultural dimensions are connected with manufacturing strategies and choices. The current article is based on data from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS) project and the GLOBE study. Advanced mass production is more common to countries with high assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance. The model of manufacturing strategies and choices in cultural context is developed based on empirical results of the study.",

The need to consider cultural factors in strategic issues has been emphasized (Wilkinson et al. 2008). Galan and Sanchez-Bueno (2009) point out the importance of context factors as highly important in fi rm's choice of strategy.",
