            "text": "Diaporthe (anamorph = Phomopsis) species are plant pathogens and endophytes on a wide range of hosts including economically important crops. At least four Diaporthe taxa occur on soybean and they are responsible for serious diseases and significant yield losses. Although several studies have extensively described the culture and morphological characters of these pathogens, their taxonomy has not been fully resolved. Diaporthe and Phomopsis isolates were obtained from soybean and other plant hosts throughout Croatia. Phylogenetic relationships were determined through analyses of partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-\u03b1) gene and ITS nrDNA sequence data. By combining morphological and molecular data, four species could be distinguished on soybeans in Croatia. Diaporthe phaseolorum is described in this study and its synonyms are discussed. Diaporthe phaseolorum var. caulivora is raised to species status and the name Diaporthe caulivora is introduced to accommodate it. A species previously known as Phomopsis sp. 9 from earlier studies on sunflower, grapevine, rooibos and hydrangea is reported for the first time on soybean, and is formally described as Diaporthe novem. The well-known soybean pathogen Phomopsis longicolla was also collected in the present study and was transferred to Diaporthe longicolla comb. nov. The presence of these species on herbaceous hosts raises once more the relevance of weeds as reservoirs for pathogens of economically important plants.",

            "text": "Diaporthe species (and their Phomopsis anamorphs) are endophytes and pathogens on a wide range of hosts, and are responsible for several diseases, some of which are of economic importance. On soybean (Glycine max), Diaporthe species cause seed decay, stem blight and stem canker, resulting in significant yield and quality losses (Backman et al. 1985, Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 1999. For example, these diseases are responsible for yield losses of up to 62 % in the former Yugoslavia, depending on the pathogen involved (Vidi\u0107 & Jasni\u0107 1998). Four Diaporthe taxa can be found on soybean: Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae, the causal agent of pod and stem blight; D. phaseolorum var. caulivora and D. aspalathi (formerly referred to as D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis), causal agents of Northern and Southern stem cankers, respectively; and Phomopsis longicolla, primarily causing seed decay. Separation of D. phaseolorum into varieties was based on morphological characters including colony appearance, size of stromata, arrangement of perithecia, presence of an anamorph, presence of alpha-and beta-conidia (Morgan-Jones 1985), symptomology and virulence on soybean (Sinclair & Backman 1989). Because of the variability found in morphology, physiology and host relationships in the D. phaseolorum complex, classification at varietal level is considered unsatisfactory (Morgan-Jones 1989).",

            "text": "Formerly, species in Diaporthe (and their Phomopsis anamorphs) were largely identified on host association. However, it is now recognised that the host is of minor importance in the taxonomy of these fungi (Rehner & Uecker 1994, Mostert et al. 2001). On the other hand, morphological characters are not always suitable for species definition because of their interand intra-species variability (van der Aa et al. 1990, Santos 2008). Currently, species of Diaporthe are distinguished mainly based on their molecular phylogenies, especially those derived from sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) (van Niekerk et al. 2005, van Rensburg et al. 2006, Santos & Phillips 2009. Some authors have also used other genomic regions as molecular markers for phylogenetic analysis in Diaporthe and Phomopsis, such as the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-\u03b1) gene (e.g., van Rensburg et al. 2006, Santos et al. 2010.",

Small tissue pieces (10-15 mm long) were excised from diseased stems. These pieces, as well as symptomless soybean seeds, were washed with tap water, surface disinfected with 96 % ethanol for 10 s and 1 % sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 1 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, dried on filter paper and then placed on potato-dextrose agar (PDA, Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) plates. Some tissue pieces were placed on moist filter paper inside a Petri dish. Petri dishes were kept at 25 \u00b0C under a 12 h light /dark regime. Developing mycelium or spores (ascospores or conidia) exuding from fruiting bodies were transferred to fresh PDA plates. Isolates were established by transferring hyphal tips from the edge of the developing mycelium to fresh PDA plates. Morphological characters were studied and recorded as in Santos & Phillips (2009). Reference isolates were deposited in the culture collection at Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands, and nomenclatural novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004). Mean, standard deviation (S.D.) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for asci, ascospores, alpha-and beta-conidia. Minimum and maximum dimensions are given in parentheses.

            "text": "Since Santos et al. (2010) suggested that EF1-\u03b1 is a better phylogenetic marker in Diaporthe and Phomopsis than ITS, we started by sequencing part of the EF1-\u03b1 gene, spanning an entire intron and partial sequence of the flanking exons, for all isolates under study. BLAST searches were done to select closely related sequences from GenBank. The sequence of Diaporthe phaseolorum isolate FAU458 was not available from GenBank and was retrieved from TreeBASE study S1506 (van Rensburg et al. 2006). The alignment consisted of 42 taxa (including two outgroups) and 387 characters (including alignment gaps and indel coding). The phylogenetic analysis was done by Bayesian analysis and Maximum Parsimony (MP). Of the 387 characters, 285 were parsimony informative and included in the MP analysis resulting in two equally parsimonious trees. The Bayesian analysis phylogram (Fig. 1) showed a similar topology and clades as the MP phylogenetic trees. Bayesian posterior probabilities followed by MP bootstrap values are shown at the nodes. clade were selected for another phylogenetic analysis based on ITS sequences. The ITS nrDNA region of these isolates was sequenced and BLAST searches were done to select closely related sequences. An alignment comprising 27 taxa (including two outgroups) and 443 characters (including alignment gaps and indel coding) and spanning ITS1 and ITS2 complete sequences as well as 18S and 28S partial sequences was included in a phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian analysis and Maximum Parsimony (MP). The sequence of the 5.8S nrDNA gene of D. phaseolorum isolate FAU458 was not available and this region was excluded from all isolates in the analysis. Of the 443 characters, 101 were parsimony informative and included in the MP analysis resulting in a single tree. The Bayesian analysis phylogram (Fig. 2) showed largely the same topology and clades as the MP analysis. Bayesian posterior probabilities followed by MP bootstrap values are shown at the nodes.",

Although only the MAT1-2 matingtype could be detected by PCR in all isolates studied, fertile perithecia formed in pure cultures. Therefore, this species is considered to be homothallic. This species is similar to D. phaseolorum but differs in having slightly wider perithecia with longer necks and shorter asci. The most distinctive character that separates these species is the production of conidiomata: while D. phaseolorum regularly produces pycnidia with alphaand beta-conidia, this is reported to be extremely rare in D. caulivora. This pathogen is the cause of Northern stem canker of soybean. Kulik (1984) could not locate the type specimen of D. phaseolorum var. caulivora, and our search for the type was also unsuccessful. Therefore we propose CBS H-20461 as neotype.",

Notes -Holotype on seed of Glycine max, Wooster, Ohio, USA (TWH P74 = BPI 358745). Ex-type culture deposited in ATCC (ATCC 60325) (Hobbs 1985). Although all of the isolates we studied possessed both mating-types, as determined by PCR diagnosis, no fertile perithecia formed under any conditions. Therefore, this species is considered to be purely anamorphic. This species differs from D. novem mainly in having solitary pycnidia producing only alpha-conidia. It differs from D. phaseolorum in having larger pycnidia and longer conidiophores and conidiogenous cells, as well as in producing only alpha-conidia.

The phylogenetic information that we supply here, together with the morphological differences and pathology of the varieties on soybean (Backman et al. 1985) adds further weight to the arguments against varietal separation, and we have proposed certain taxonomic changes. One of the varieties (D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis) has already been shown to be phylogenetically distinct and was elevated by van Rensburg et al. (2006) to species status. The name D. aspalathi was newly introduced since D. meridionalis was already occupied.",

All of the isolates that we studied that clustered phylogenetically with FAU458 correlated entirely with the morphology of the isotype of Sphaeria phaseolorum. Furthermore, all of these isolates were homothallic and readily formed the teleomorph in culture, which is a recognised feature of D. phaseolorum.

Later, for the same reason and after a thorough search of the literature, together with morphological studies of various specimens and isolates, Kulik (1984) placed all of these pathogens under the same name (D. phaseolorum), rejecting their separation into different varieties. Their anamorphs, Phomopsis phaseoli, P. sojae and P. batatas, respectively, were placed under P. phaseoli. In fact, the amount of variation in the size of perithecia, ascospores, pycnidia, alpha-and beta-conidia reported within each taxon at least equals the variation between them (Kulik 1984). Almost at the same time, Hobbs et al. (1985) considered the type specimen of Phomopsis glycines to be morphologically the same as P. sojae, and included this binomial to the list of synonyms of D. phaseolorum.",

An extensive search for the herbarium specimens was done but unfortunately none could be found. However, the original description of this fungus corresponds in all ways with the anamorph of D. phaseolorum. Since P. camptothecae is morphologically and phylogenetically indistinguishable from the anamorph of D. phaseolorum it was considered to be a synonym. Kulik (1984) was not sure about the differences between the stem canker pathogenic agent (D. phaseolorum var. caulivora) and all the other varieties of D. phaseolorum. Although he placed this variety as a synonym of D. phaseolorum, he suggested that it should be called D. phaseolorum f. sp. caulivora until further studies confirm its true identity. In the present work, we have shown that D. phaseolorum var. caulivora is a distinct species (D. caulivora) that also occurs on soybean in Croatia.",

Our next approach was similar to the one followed by van Rensburg et al. (2006) to describe D. aspalathi. In that study, the ITS and EF1-\u03b1 of isolates identified as D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis were sequenced and shown to be too distinct from the reference isolate of D. phaseolorum (FAU458) to consider them as a mere variety. In our work, we showed that both ITS and EF1-\u03b1 support a clear separation of D. phaseolorum var. caulivora from the same reference isolate of D. phaseolorum, and thus named it D. caulivora.",

Only MAT1-2 mating-type could be detected in the isolates that we studied.

However, no teleomorph was seen in pure cultures. The inability for isolates to form their sexual state, together with the fact that the teleomorph of this species has never been found in nature indicates that this might be a purely anamorphic species. The existence of different mating-types in asexual ascomycetes is well documented (Coppin et al. 1997, Arie et al. 2000, P\u00f6ggeler 2001) and other asexual Phomopsis species are known to possess both mating-types, such as Phomopsis viticola (Santos et al. 2010). Nevertheless, in D. longicolla both mating-types are present in the same isolate, which is in contrast to P. viticola where the different mating-types are present in separate isolates (Santos et al. 2010).",

This is an unidentified species that was reported recently on Aspalathus linearis (van Rensburg et al. 2006) and Hydrangea macrophylla (Santos et al. 2010). ITS sequence comparison revealed that this species has also been found on Helianthus annuus (Rekab et al. 2004) and Vitis vinifera (van Niekerk et al. 2005) under the name of D. helianthi. Van Rensburg et al. (2006) declined to apply a name to this species because they had only one isolate that did not sporulate. In the present study, not only did our isolates produce fertile pycnidia but they also formed perithecia when isolates of opposite mating-types were crossed in culture. This is the first time that the teleomorph of this species has been observed and the name D. novem is applied to it. To our knowledge, this is also the first report of this species on soybean. Moreover, all of our isolates, except AS1, were from soybean seeds collected during September 2008 in Slavonija County in Croatia. This can thus be considered a consistent isolation of this species from soybean in Croatia. Pathogenicity studies would help to clarify if this species represents a threat or if it is a weak pathogen on this host. It is important to note that this fungus was always isolated from symptomless seeds and never from diseased stems. Future isolations of Diaporthe and Phomopsis from soybean, especially in Croatia, will confirm whether this is an emergent pathogen on this host.",

Diaporthe novem was also shown to have both mating-types but in separate isolates, thus indicating that this is a heterothallic species. This implied that the teleomorph of D. novem could only be observed when isolates of opposite mating-types were crossed in culture. Diaporthe caulivora is also shown to be self-fertile. However, only the MAT1-2 locus could be detected in all isolates. Finally, the PCRs revealed that the tested D. longicolla isolates possess both mating-types, as in the case of D. phaseolorum.",

The second clade consists of D. lusitanicae (Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00 and MP bootstrap support of 99 %) and the third clade consists of D. novem. The separation between D. lusitanicae and D. novem is not completely evident in this tree, since a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00 and a MP bootstrap value of 99 % support a single branch that includes both species. However, in the MP tree, a further dichotomic subdivision of this branch is observed, thus unambiguously separating them (not shown).As in Fig. 1, D. melonis clusters as a distinct species based on ITS sequences. Mating-type diagnosis Santos et al. (2010) developed degenerate primers for the mating-type diagnosis of Diaporthe and Phomopsis isolates by PCR. This approach was used in the present study to narrow down the number of crossings between isolates necessary to induce teleomorphs in culture. The PCR diagnosis revealed that",
