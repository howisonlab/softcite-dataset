Both mandates were first enacted at the state level but have been studied only in isolation. We estimate a wide range of models allowing these mandates to have joint effects on insurance coverage, health-care access, health outcomes and fertility. We provide new evidence that helps settle the mixed findings from past state-level YAD and CM research and suggests the two mandates may combine to improve the well-being of young adults.

            "text": "Young adults are typically low-risk/low-cost users of health insurance who are also among the most likely to be uninsured. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) targeted this group and contains two key mandates of particular benefit to young adults: (1) extending the provision of young adult-dependent coverage (YAD) on family insurance plans to age 26 and (2) requiring all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive methods to be available to women with no cost sharing (HRSA 2015). Both of these provisions were enacted at the state level prior to the national reform, thus providing a natural setting for researchers to test their effects (e.g., Depew 2015;Levine, McKnight, and Heep 2011;Monheit et al. 2011 for YAD; Mulligan 2015; Raissian and Lopoo 2015 for contraception mandates [CMs]). However, the key findings from this research are decidedly mixed. Moreover, no research has taken a comprehensive approach to studying these two mandates in tandem.",

We make three contributions. First, ours is the first study to investigate the effects of both mandates. Our approach not only avoids the possible bias caused by ignoring a related health insurance policy but allows for the mandates to reinforce (or diminish) each other's effects. Such an interaction between the mandates appears plausible for young women. Given their typically low risk of serious health problems yet higher fertility, the costs because of pregnancy likely loom large.",

Similarly, Raissian and Lopoo (2015) note that CMs only help those women who have insurance; thus, a CM may have stronger effects in states where young women have better access to health insurance, such as provided by a YAD mandate. Even if these mandates do not combine to increase health insurance coverage, they could still combine to affect the care women receive and their health outcomes. For example, a woman covered by a YAD may not bother going to the doctor for routine care if she is using nonprescription contraception (e.g., condoms, spermicide); the addition of a CM may encourage her to seek prescription contraception and lead her to get such routine care, care which could potentially diagnose, treat, or prevent other health conditions (like depression).",

Depew (2015) and Colman and Dave (2015) find that YADs reduce labor supply; the latter also find a decrease in time spent waiting for or receiving health care and an increase in \"socializing.\" Such second-order effects could lead YADs to affect both care received and health outcomes (indeed, Colman and Dave 2015, find an increase in subjective well-being) as well as influence reproductive behavior and the desire for contraception. These scenarios suggest that the effects of these mandates can operate through 1. These estimates contain an initial physician visit cost of $41.45 taken from the 2011 Medicare fee schedule; however, other evidence from the Medical Expenditure Survey (MEPS) by Davis and Carper (2012) suggests that the average expense for a visit to a primary physician is closer to $145, or for an OB-GYN $235. For context, note that the average earnings for 18-24-year-old women in 2009 was $24,117 according to the U.S. Census Bureau (2012). multiple avenues and may be influenced by whether the other mandate exists, an interaction effect we model explicitly.",

This approach allows us to both fill in the gaps left by existing research and bring new evidence to key outcomes for which past findings are mixed. Research on state-level YAD mandates (e.g., Levine, McKnight, and Heep 2011;Monheit et al. 2011) focuses on insurance coverage. 2 In contrast, research on CMs primarily focuses on sexual activity and contraception use (Atkins and Bradford 2014;Magnusson et al. 2012;Raissian and Lopoo 2015) and birth and abortion rates (Dills and Cotet-Grecu 2016;Mulligan 2015). Possible effects on insurance coverage or on more general health-care utilization and health outcomes that may arise out of the complementary consumption of health services have been mostly ignored. 3 Our study investigates the effects of both mandates, first in isolation and then allowing for joint effects, for health insurance coverage; health-care access; general health outcomes; and pregnancies, births, and abortions. Drawing from several data sources also allows us to explore multiple independent measures of insurance coverage, general health, and reproductive outcomes, bringing new evidence and a different kind of robustness check to past work.",

Six states adopted YADs in 2009 alone, yet the two key studies observing their effect on coverage end in 2008 (Levine, McKnight, and Heep 2011;Monheit et al. 2011). Some recent YAD research emphasizes including narrower, more targeted age groups (e.g., Slusky 2015), while Depew (2015) advocates for a wider age range such that eligibility can be based on age rather than marital or student status, which may be endogenous. Recent work also explores sensitivity to including location-specific time trends and emphasizes the need to test for pretrends and conduct placebo tests (e.g., Depew 2015; Dills and Cotet-Grecu 2016; Mulligan 2015; Slusky 2.

To our knowledge, no published study has investigated the causal effects of the ACA CM. 2015). We estimate every outcome with several difference-in-difference (DD) and triple difference (DDD) models and subject each one to sensitivity and robustness checks. These exercises lend support to the emerging view that YADs did not significantly increase insurance coverage and, instead, led to a switch in the source of coverage. Our analyses also bring new evidence to the mixed findings regarding CMs' effects on fertility by finding that they reduce reported pregnancies. Finally, our joint models yield suggestive evidence that the two mandates combine to improve the general well-being of young adults, although the precise mechanism for the effect is not clear.",

The issue first received national attention in the form of the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraception Coverage Act (EPICC) in 1997, yet Congress failed to enact the bill. States, however, seized the opportunity to establish their own initiatives, starting with Maryland in 1998, extending contraception coverage to women with insurance plans that covered other prescription drug benefits. By 2009, more than 25 states had enacted similar CMs. The ACA extended outpatient contraceptive services and prescription drug benefits to all insured women starting August 1, 2012 at zero cost sharing (HRSA 2015).",

In 1974, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) set the minimum standards for firms extending employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) benefits to their employees and exempted self-insured firms from state-level insurance mandates. In 2009, 59% of ESI plans were issued by self-insured firms (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundations and Health Research and Educational Trust [HRET] 2010), such that they are not covered by the mandates. 5 A second complication is that the increased cost of the newly mandated benefits may decrease ESI offers. Unfortunately, data sources that have measures of care utilization and health outcomes, including those we employ here, do not have information on ESI offers or ERISA status.",

Most studies examine the effect of state-level YAD mandates across all or most states, although a few focus only on the Massachusetts Health Reform in 2006. Each employs quasiexperimental, DD, or DDD frameworks, using young adults not eligible for the mandates and/or living in states without mandates as control groups. The majority of studies of coverage use the Current Population Survey (CPS), which allows the identification of the source of coverage (own, dependent) and, for young adults living with their parents, whether the policy holders work for small employers who 5. Nonetheless, evidence provided by Sonfield et al. (2004) suggests that CMs led to an increase of insurance plans including contraception coverage. 6. We provide a similar summary table (Table S1) for ACA mandate research. However, it only has one column (for YAD) because, to our knowledge, no research yet exists with respect to the contraception mandate with the exception Finer, Sonfield, and Jones (2014), a descriptive study that reports that the percentage of privately insured women paying zero out-of-pocket expenses for contraception increased after the ACA.  2002-2004 vs. 2008-2009) Descriptive 1 st Study,[19][20][21][22][23]3    2002-2004 vs. 2008-2009) Descriptive 1 st Study,[19][20][21][22][23]3   (NSFG 1995(NSFG , 2002(NSFG , 2006(NSFG -2010 DD, 15-44 privately insured only, includes indicator for mandates that cover services and supplies or suppliers: no effect on contraception use, 8% increase in pill use by women with low education, driven by supply mandates. are therefore more likely affected by state-level reforms (because of ERISA). There remains some debate about whether the overall uninsured rate decreases (Levine, McKnight, and Heep 2011) or is unaffected because of reverse crowdout from own to parent coverage (Monheit et al. 2011;Depew 2015, who also finds a decrease in young adult labor supply). These differences stem from differences in definition of controls (19-24 vs. 19-29) and identification of eligibility. Using CPS data and DD as well as the alternative DDD strategies of Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011) versus Depew (2015), we attempt to replicate past results, compare approaches, and explore the role that CMs may play. We also estimate these models using a health insurance measure from a different data source, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).",

To our knowledge, only one study (Blum et al. 2012) considers the effect of state-level YADs on care utilization, and no study examines outcomes. 7 Table 1 makes it clear that several gaps exist in studying the effects of CMs as well. These studies focus on contraceptive use (care utilization) and fertility and birth outcomes (reproductive health outcomes), with most finding a positive effect on contraceptive use. This research typically takes a DD approach and considers broader age groups than YAD research as all women of childbearing age may be potentially affected by CMs. Only Raissian and Lopoo (2015) consider more general types of health care, finding an increase in pap smears for states that mandate contraceptive services and supplies. We consider a still broader set of care utilization variables that have not yet been investigated in CM research. Raissian and Lopoo (2015) also make the point that CMs may not have much impact because they only affect women with health insurance-which is precisely why we believe it is critical to investigate the joint effects of contraceptive and YAD mandates. To our knowledge, only two economic studies address the direct effect of CMs on health outcomes, and both investigate only reproductive outcomes with contradicting findings. Mulligan (2015) uses state-level Vital Statistics data on fertility outcomes (births and abortions) and individual-level CPS Fertility Supplement data and finds a decline in both births and abortions, although the former is sensitive to including state-specific time trends. Dills and Cotet-Grecu (2016) conduct a similar analysis using the restricted-use Vital Statistics data but incorporate a more extensive set of individual-and state-level characteristics and policies. They find no robust effects on overall births with the exception of one subgroup, Hispanic teens (<19), who experience a decline in births.",

We estimate a DD model for each mandate separately and for one that allows for a joint effect. However, because most YAD studies exploit the fact that not all young adults are eligible and so employ a DDD approach, we also estimate two alternative DDD models that rely on different identification strategies.

In our case, with two potentially interacting laws occurring over a short time frame (13 years), the typical approaches (plotting trends before and after the law, estimating the pre-and post-effects of the law) greatly strain the data. 9 To our knowledge, no one has attempted these approaches in such a setting. Furthermore, these approaches become even more untenable-and less necessary-in the DDD models we consider next. 10 We instead address this concern in two ways, both of which can be applied to all models we estimate (single mandate and the full models, DD and DDD models alike). First, we subject all models to a placebo test in which each mandate variable is replaced with a dummy of whether the mandate was in place 3 years in the future. This test is a more parsimonious way of seeing if the different \"treatment\" states behaved differently even before the mandate(s) was passed. It is also straightforward to apply to our more complicated DDD models. We are further reassured that, for our simpler onemandate DD models, estimating a dynamic specification with a full set of leads and lags of the policy typically yields similar conclusions to our 3-year lead placebo. 11 Second, we estimate all DD models both with and without state-specific 9. To illustrate, consider an event time plot where there are now five potential types of treatment states: (1) those that only adopt a YAD, (2) those that only adopt a CM, (3) those that first adopt a YAD then a CM, (4) those that adopt a CM and then a YAD, and (5) those that adopt both at the same time. Not only does that split the data into six groups (five treatment + one control), but there are also two events (\"time zero\") to consider. Similarly, a dynamic regression, such as that estimated by Bellou and Bhatt (2013), would include thrice the number of lead and lag coefficients (one set for each mandate plus their interaction).",

This approach pools together young adults at potentially very different points in their lives and has been subject to strong criticism in studies of the ACA (which must rely on age; e.g., Slusky 2015). Put simply, adults aged 25-29 (who are ineligible in most YAD states) may not be an appropriate control group for those aged 19-24. If the analysis is instead limited to that narrower, more homogeneous age group, as Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011) does, then other, arguably endogenous, eligibility criteria such as marital and student status must be used.

Depew (2015) uses only age to determine eligibility and expands the ages considered to 29. Depew (2015) also includes the full set of state-by-year, state-by-age, and year-by-age fixed effects. This full set of fixed effects allows the treatment and control groups to differ with respect to other factors in a very flexible way. It also includes location-specific time effects in an even less restrictive manner than statespecific time trends. We adapt this specification to our three models (Equations (1)-(3)) by first expanding our sample to ages 19-29; note that this means that our \"CM-only\" model results are different for the \"Depew\" model because of the wider age group and richer set of fixed effects included. In contrast, the \"Levine\" CMonly model is identical to the DD model without state-specific time trends. Second, eligibility is now equal to one if the individual is below the cut-off age for the YAD in the individual's state. Equations (1b)-(3b) (next page) reflect this distinction, with eligibility indexed by a and s, age and state, respectively, only. Finally, this model requires adding the full set of age*state, age*year, and state*year fixed effects. However, the effect of a CM will be completely subsumed in the stateby-year fixed effects. We therefore adapt our \"Depew\" model to include state-specific time trends instead. To explore the impact of this restriction, we also try including state-specific quadratic time trends, and we re-estimate the YAD-only model including the full set of state*year fixed effects. The results are reasonably similar, lending support to our approach.",

We first examine the variation in state-level insurance mandates and then discuss the different datasets we use: the CPS (coverage and health status), the BRFSS (coverage, care, and health and reproductive outcomes), and the Vital Statistics (reproductive outcomes). We conclude by discussing the individual-and state-level controls we include, as well as robustness checks and placebo tests.  Table S2 and reveals several discrepancies across the different sources. For CMs, the differences are fairly minor 14 ; for YADs, however, they are much more widespread, and no two studies use the exact same list, a point also noted in Burgdorf (2014). The differences appear to be because of the use of implementation versus effective dates, states with multiple changes to extended coverage eligibility criteria, and the censoring of most samples in 2008. We arrive at our final list by cross-referencing the discrepancies with state legislation recorded in WestLaw. As is the convention, we omit Massachusetts from our analyses because of its personal mandate. Figure S1, Supporting Information, summarizes the adoption of these mandates over time, as well as the state-specific requirements for YAD eligibility, and Figure S2 shows the geographic variation over time. While both reveal the accelerating adoption of both mandates during this short time period, they also suggest substantial independent variation in each one. We explore their correlation formally by estimating stateyear panel models in which the presence/absence of each mandate is regressed on the other as well as state and year fixed effects. This exercise reveals a statistically significant positive relationship between the two, which suggests that considering each mandate in isolation could lead to bias. 15 At the same time, there appears to be sufficient independent variation to identify the separate and joint effects of each mandate. 16",

We employ Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011)'s dataset and code submitted for publication in the AEJ: Economic Policy 17 to replicate and expand their analyses by (1) including state CMs; (2) using the revised list of YAD mandates; and (3) adding data for 1997-1999 and post-2008, 18 more ages (25-29), and the self-reported health measure.

This limitation highlights the benefits of the Pregnant variable we investigate from the BRFSS; to our knowledge, we are the first to do so in this kind of research. At the same time, we note that Pregnant differs from these fertility measures because (1) it captures whether the woman is pregnant and knows it at the time of the survey (and so misses many pregnancies over the course of a year), and (2) it captures some eventual miscarriages (which are missed in aggregate fertility measures). Table 2 suggests that the former is larger than the latter as the 8% reported pregnancy rate in the BRFSS is substantially lower than the birth + abortion rates per 1,000 women observed in the Vital Statistics.",

Using the CPS measure and the \"Levine\" YAD-DDD model, our results are close to those of Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011), despite including more years (1997-1999 and 2009), using slightly different mandate dates, and limiting our analyses to women. 24 However, the rest of our analyses provide very little evidence that either mandate increased insurance coverage. Using the BRFSS insurance measure instead is especially damaging, often leading to estimated negative effects. Our results are therefore consistent with the conclusion drawn by Depew (2015) and Monheit et al. (2011), which state that YADs did little to increase overall insurance coverage and may have instead simply caused a shifting between group versus individual, parent versus own, and/or private versus public. The results for CMs and the joint effect of CM and YAD likewise suggest little consistent effect, although it is somewhat surprising that they are found to be positive and significant about as often as the much more heavily studied YAD. The health-care access measures from the BRFSS, Not Afford and Checkup, likewise yield no consistent evidence that either mandate expanded young women's access to general health care, and in fact, the estimated effects are just as likely to be detrimental as beneficial (see Table S4). Given that we find no evidence that these mandates expanded insurance coverage, it is not surprising to find little effect on these general measures of care received. It nonetheless remains possible that switching types of coverage (\u00e0 la YADs) could affect access in subtler ways, such as the quality or convenience of care received. If YADs lead young adults to switch to their parents' insurance, then that new insurance may differ in its coverage of contraception if the state also has a CM. Likewise, as Depew (2015) and Colman and Dave (2015) find, the switch in health insurance may have been accompanied by other changed behaviors. Such subtle mechanisms suggest that these mandates could still have effects on general health, and the avenue for CMs to affect reproductive outcomes-by expanding contraceptive use among the insured-remains. Table 4 reports results for several measures of general health. The first two panels 24. Specifically, Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011) find a statistically significant increase of 0.033 (Table 5, Panel A, column 2 on p. 148), while ours suggests a 0.028 increase.",

The \"Levine\" model finds it is CMs and perhaps the joint effect (CM*YAD) that are beneficial and that YADs are harmful if anything.

            "text": "This research takes a comprehensive approach to studying the effects of insurance mandates on young adults by using contrasting empirical methodologies to estimate the individual and possibly joint effects of both YAD and contraception insurance mandates on a wide set of outcomes spanning several different datasets. Our approach helps settle conflicting past findings as well as uncovers more complicated pathways for these mandates to have an effect. For YADs, our results support the more tepid findings of Depew (2015) and others that such mandates do not significantly increase overall insurance coverage. Rather, the strong effects of Levine, McKnight, and Heep (2011) appear unique to their methodology and data source (the CPS). Using an alternative methodology (e.g., a DDD based on age only) or dataset (BRFSS) overturns the positive results we find using the CPS and their approach.",

We do find some evidence, however, that the two mandates combine to affect the general health and well-being of young adults, an effect that is mostly obscured if each mandate is considered in isolation. Such effects are plausible in light of past work that finds other pathways for YADs to have an effect (through a change in coverage type or reducing labor supply) and our results here that CMs appear likely to have an effect on reproductive behavior.",

Our analyses face the difficulty of identifying the unique and joint effects of two mandates using the relatively small number of years and states in which policy changes take place. This challenge is compounded by the fact that these mandates likely fail to reach a significant proportion of young women; that is, the gap between intent-to-treat (what we estimate) and treatment-on-the-treated estimates is large. This is especially true for our DD and age-based DDD YAD models because many young adults do not satisfy other eligibility requirements. More broadly, neither mandate is binding for those young adults who get their insurance from self-insured firms (because of ERISA) or who already receive such coverage prior to the law. As noted by Depew (2015), such attenuation bias is likely to lead to insignificant results and is why he uses the American Community Survey to study labor supply, a very large dataset that is nearly 20 times bigger than the CPS or BRFSS. While these challenges extend to all studies of state-level YADs and CMs, studying both in tandem and subjecting them to such substantial robustness checks (different data sources and empirical methodologies) appears almost certain to exacerbate them and makes the consistent findings that do emerge compelling.",
