            "text": "To date, the most prevalent model for transport of pre-proteins to plant mitochondria is based on the activity of an N-terminal extension serving as a targeting peptide. Whether the efficient delivery of proteins to mitochondria is based exclusively on the action of the N-terminal extension or also on that of other protein determinants has yet to be defined. A novel mechanism is reported here for the targeting of a plant protein, named MITS1, to mitochondria. It was found that MITS1 contains an N-terminal extension that is responsible for mitochondrial targeting. Functional dissection of this extension shows the existence of a cryptic signal for protein targeting to the secretory pathway. The first 11 amino acids of the N-terminal extension are necessary to overcome the activity of this signal sequence and target the protein to the mitochondria. These data suggest that cooperation of multiple determinants within the N-terminal extension of mitochondrial proteins may be necessary for efficient mitochondrial targeting. It was also established that the presence of a tryptophan residue toward the C-terminus of the protein is crucial for mitochondrial targeting, as mutation of this residue results in a redistribution of MITS1 to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These data suggest a novel targeting model whereby protein traffic to plant mitochondria is influenced by domains in the full-length protein as well as the N-terminal extension.",

            "text": "In eukaryotic cells, the presence of several distinct organelles generates the need for efficient protein targeting mechanisms of newly synthesized proteins. Targeting of most proteins destined to the secretory pathway is initiated by the binding of the signal recognition particle (SRP) to a signal sequence in a nascent polypeptide chain emerging from a cytosolic ribosome. The nascent polypeptide is then co-translationally inserted in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) upon recognition of the SRP by an ER-membrane anchored SRP receptor (Nagai et al., 2003). The synthesis of proteins destined to other organelles, such as plastids and mitochondria, generally occurs on free ribosomes and the targeting is post-translational (reviewed in Alder and Johnson, 2004). Protein targeting to mitochondria relies on an N-terminal extension on the protein precursor, the so-called pre-sequence, which directs the protein to the organelles. Pre-sequences do not have a common primary sequence but are generally composed of an N-terminal leader sequence of 20-35 amino acids, enriched in basic, hydrophobic, and hydroxylated residues (Neupert, 1997;Schatz and Dobberstein, 1996). The pre-sequence appears to fold into a defined secondary structure. This folding is essential for the correct distribution of charged and apolar residues and is necessary for efficient protein import (Matouschek et al., 1997;Gaume et al., 1998). The N-terminal part of the pre-sequence forms a positively charged amphiphilic a-helix or b-sheet, whereas the Cterminal region probably serves as a recognition site for matrix proteases (Gavel and von Heijne, 1990;Neupert, 1997). Pre-sequences are generally cleaved off from precursors as they pass through the mitochondrial double membrane via the outer and inner membrane translocases (TOM and TIM complexes, respectively), or once inside the mitochondria by specific peptidases (for reviews see Neupert, 1997;Glaser et al., 1998).",

A novel nuclear-encoded Arabidopsis thaliana protein has been identified, called MITS1 (MItochondrial-Targeting Signal 1), which appears to be targeted to mitochondria. Live cell imaging analyses of the N-terminal extension of MITS1 and a series of MITS1-deletions fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) indicated that the N-terminal presequence is responsible for the intracellular targeting of the protein. However, in contrast to the full-length peptide, a leaderless pre-sequence (lacking the first 11 amino acids) directed YFP protein fusions to the ER. Furthermore, mutation of a tryptophan residue at position 361 (W361A) resulted in the redistribution of MITS1 to the ER and Golgi apparatus, suggesting that mitochondrial targeting processes in plant cells may rely not only on the composition of the pre-sequence but also on that of other domains within the protein sequence.",

            "text": "MITS1 is efficiently targeted to plant mitochondria MITS1 (AGI: At1g52080) is a putative actin-binding protein of 573 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 66 kDa. The N-terminal region of this protein (39 amino acids) contains a hydrophobic stretch of 20 residues (predicted with TMHMM and TMPred (Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993;Krogh et al., 2001) and flanking regions enriched with positively-charged amino acids ( Fig. 1A). Because of the predicted secondary structure of this sequence, various publicly available bio-informatics tools suggest targeting of MITS1 to mitochondria (see Materials and methods). To confirm this prediction experimentally, full-length MITS1 was fused to the N-terminus of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; Fig. 1A), and the resulting construct was expressed in tobacco leaf epidermal cells for live cell confocal microscopy analyses. For simplicity, this construct was named MITS1. MITS1 appeared in numerous structures of heterogeneous size and shape ( Fig.  1B), resembling the previously described appearance of plant mitochondria (Logan and Leaver, 2000). Co-localization analyses of MITS1 with b-ATPase:GFP, a known mitochondrial marker (Logan and Leaver, 2000), confirmed that MITS1 localizes to mitochondria (Fig. 1B), thus providing experimental support for our prediction. These observations prompted us to carry out a functional dissection of the NH 2 -terminal extension of MITS1 to identify the targeting determinants within this region.",

This is consistent with the required presence of the positively charged region in functional mitochondrial pre-sequences (Duby et al., 2001). Interestingly, however, the MITS1 12-39 peptide fusion ( Fig. 2A), which was made by adding a methionine residue upfront to allow translation, and contained the hydrophobic core region and the positively-charged flanking region, was localized to the ER as well as the mitochondria ( Figs 2B, 4).

The data presented above mirrored the Helical Wheel Projection analyses of each peptide that showed that peptide 12-39 has the most cationic charges on the side of the helix after peptide 1-39, followed by peptides 1-31 and 1-11 ( Fig. 2C). Consistent with these Helical Wheel projections, peptides 1-39 and 12-39 were capable of targeting YFP to the mitochondria, although a subcellular pool of the 12-39 YFP fusion was also directed to the ER. On the other hand, the remaining peptides (1-11 and 1-31) were not sufficient for directing YFP to any organelle, most likely due to the absence of a defined cationic side on the helical structure.",

Within the MITS1 sequence two tryptophan residues (W361 and W416) were found. Tryptophan is a rare amino acid that is known to be involved in the targeting and stability of some proteins (Garcia et al., 1992;Kleinberger-Doron and Kanner, 1994;Fig. 2. Exploration of the N-terminal 39 residues of MITS1 reveals that a co-ordination of three regions is required for efficient mitochondria targeting. (A) Schematic representation of the N-terminal consecutive domains fused to YFP and their subsequent intracellular localizations. (B) Region 1-39 efficiently targets a YFP to mitochondria (arrow) and the YFP punctate structures fully colocalize with b-ATPase:GFP (arrows). 1-11:YFP (missing the central hydrophobic core and the positively-charged region) and 1-31:YFP (missing the positively-charged region) were localized to the cytosol (empty arrowheads). (C) The Helical Wheel Projection of MITS1 Nterminal pre-sequence shows a cationic cluster in 1-39 and 12-39 sequences (but not in the other pre-sequence truncations) consistent with their localization to mitochondria (blue dots are hydrophobic residues, + indicates positive charge). Insets: magnified section of main panels. Scale bars\u00bc5 lm. Hoffman et al., 2006). Therefore it was decided to test whether mutation of either of these residues in the fulllength MITS1 would affect the mitochondrial targeting of MITS1. Each of the two tryptophan residues was changed to alanine (W361A and W416A, see Fig. 5A for a schematic representation) and the constructs were expressed as YFP-fusions in plants. Confocal microscopy analyses revealed that the mutant MITS1 W361A (Fig. 5B) was localized at the ER and the Golgi apparatus, as demonstrated by co-expression of the mutant with the known ER and Golgi marker, ERD2:GFP (Boevink et al., 1998); Fig.  5B). Colocalization analyses with b-ATPase:GFP further excluded the possibility that the punctate structures labelled by MITS1 W361A were mitochondria (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, a MITS1 bearing mutation of the tryptophan residue at position 416 (MITS1 W416A ) was localized at mitochondria labelled with b-ATPase:GFP (Fig. 5B) in the same manner as wild-type MITS1 (Fig.  1B). These data suggest that the integrity of specific amino acids that are distal from the N-terminal domain of a mitochondrial protein affect the function of a pre-sequence in a dominant fashion.",

To investigate this, a YFP fusion was constructed of the MITS1 W361A mutant lacking the first 11 residues of full-length MITS1 (MITS1 12-W361A-573 ; Fig. 6A). Differently from the ER/mitochondria targeting of MITS1 12-573 ( Fig. 6B; see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), the resulting chimera was found in the cytosol (Fig.  6B). As incorporation of the alanine residue in position 361 must occur after the synthesis of the N-terminal 12-39 sequence which is responsible for ER and mitochondria targeting, these data further strengthen our hypothesis that distal protein residues may influence targeting properties of an N-terminal sequence.",

To exclude the possibility that the punctate structures labelled by MITS1  peptide fusion were Golgi bodies, cells were cotransformed with the ER/Golgi marker, ERD2:GFP (Boevink et al., 1998) and MITS1  . As shown in this figure, MITS1 12-39 labelled the ER (empty arrow), and dots (full arrow), which did not colocalize with the Golgi (arrowhead). These dots corresponded to mitochondria as shown in Fig. 2. Insets: magnified section of main panels. Scale bars\u00bc5 lm. indicate MITS1 as a putative actin-binding protein, with an 'actinin-type actin-binding domain signature 1' that is similar to a region involved in the actin-binding activity of the chloroplastic actin-binding protein, CHUP1 (Oikawa et al., 2003). In addition, several different types of protein domain prediction software revealed that MITS1 contains an AAA-ATPase motif (55-360; SMART, Schultz et al., 1998;Letunic et al., 2006), and two leucine zipper patterns (279-300 and 324-345; ScanProsite, (Hulo et al., 2008). In contrast with CHUP1, MITS1 is localized to mitochondria. Helical Wheel analysis strongly suggests that the presequence of MITS1 attains a secondary structure with a clustered cationic side that is a known property of mitochondria targeting sequences (Duby et al., 2001). The N-terminal part of the mitochondrial pre-sequence is believed to fold into an amphiphilic a-helix both in a phospholipid environment and in vivo (Roise et al., 1988;Lemire et al., 1989). Consistent with these observations, the MITS1 mutants with a less defined polar cluster on the side of the helical wheel, compared with the 1-39 peptide, showed a reduced ability to target YFP to mitochondria. Although stability of the a-helix is important for maintenance of mitochondrial import (Hammen et al., 1996;Heard and Weiner, 1998), in vivo mutagenesis analysis of a plant presequence from the b-subunit of the F 1 -ATPsynthase from Nicotiana plumbaginifolia showed that the N-terminal helical structure of the pre-sequence is necessary but not sufficient for efficient mitochondrial import, and that its hydrophobic residues play an essential role in in vivo mitochondrial targeting (Duby et al., 2001). These findings may explain how peptide 12-39, which maintained a similar cluster of cationic amino acids on the side of the helix in comparison to the full-length pre-sequence, showed targeting to the mitochondria and also to other organelles. It is possible that the distribution of the hydrophobic residues of peptide 12-39 may be altered, resulting in a less efficient targeting signal in comparison to the full-length presequence. The MITS1 pre-sequence contains promiscuous targeting signals",

Whether the putative signal sequence masked by the first 11 amino acids is functional for MITS1 in planta is unknown, but the presence of multiple targeting signals in the same protein sequence has been reported for certain post-translationally targeted proteins containing either a nuclear localization signal (AtLIG1; Sunderland et al., 2006) or peroxisomal signal (FPS protein;Martin et al., 2007). In these cases, the function of the mitochondrial pre-sequence resulted in a dominant effect over the other sequences. It has also been demonstrated that chimeric signals may be functional in directing proteins to different organelles in the same cell. This is the case for chloroplast and plant mitochondrial proteins (Brink et al., 1994;Pujol et al., 2007), which, to some extent, have similar targeting sequences. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that some chimeric signal sequences may retain the ability for ER and mitochondria targeting. For example, for the biogenesis of the hepatic P4501A1 isoenzyme a microsomal signal sequence may be cleaved to activate a mitochondrial targeting signal (Addya et al., 1997). In this experimental system, we did not observe ER localization of either a pre-sequence-YFP fusion or fulllength MITS1-YFP fusion but it will be interesting to determine whether the activation of the microsomal signal sequence in MITS1 may occur in planta (i.e. the activation may be development or stress-regulated), as this may represent a novel protein targeting mechanism.",

These data support the suggestion that, in plant cells, the nature of the mature protein can also affect the targeting properties of the pre-sequence (Lee and Whelan, 2004). As mitochondrial targeting is a process that occurs post-translationally and involves interaction of the newly synthesized proteins with cytosolic chaperones (Young et al., 2003;Yano et al., 2004), it is possible that the integrity of distal domains of preproteins is important for a productive surface interaction with these chaperones for efficient targeting.",

This is because peptide 12-39 and MITS1 12-573 were found to be sufficient to target YFP to  -573 :YFP in the cytosol (empty arrowhead) but no colocalization with b-ATPase:GFP. MITS1 12-573 was found in the ER (empty arrows) and dots. Most of these colocalized with mitochondria (full arrows) but not with the Golgi (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online).

One possibility is that the 12-39 peptide associates with the cytosolic face of the ER, rather than facilitating translocation through the ER membrane.",
