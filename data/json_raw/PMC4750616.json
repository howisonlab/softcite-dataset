            "text": "Objective: Unnecessary exposure of the abdomen, arms or head may lead to a substantial increase of the radiation dose in portable chest X-rays on the neonatal intensive care unit. The objective was to identify potential factors influencing inappropriate exposure of non-thoracic structures in two teaching hospitals. Methods: The study analysed 200 consecutive digital chest radiographs in 20 preterm neonates (mean gestation 25 \u00b1 1 weeks). Demographical data, tube settings and exposure parameters were recorded. To grade the collimation, we used a scoring system with a maximum of 12 exposed non-thoracic structures. Length of gestation, age, the radiographer, years of experience in performing X-rays and the number of in situ catheters or lines, were correlated with collimation quality. Results: There was no significant difference between the rates of optimal images obtained in the two hospitals (0.32 vs 0.39, n.s.). Scores showed that most suboptimal images had only mildly reduced image quality (1.40 \u00b1 1.38 vs 1.20 \u00b1 1.43, n.s.). Length of gestation or presence of surgical drains, catheters and tubes had no obvious effects on the exposure of non-thoracic structures. Large intra-individual variation in optimal collimation (14-86%) was noted for the radiographers in both hospitals; this was unrelated to their respective years of experience. Conclusion: In our study, the only identifiable factor influencing the collimation of portable chest radiographs in preterm infants was the radiographer's dedication and awareness. There were no apparent differences between the hospitals investigated. Exposure of non-thoracic structures was relatively frequent and mainly involved the proximal humeri."

In a special care baby unit, premature neonates have serious and life-threatening diseases that may require a large number of X-rays for diagnosis and treatment [4,5]. Increased neonatal radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy increase the risk of radiation-induced cancer, which emphasises the importance of minimising the dose while maintaining a clinically satisfactory image quality [6].",

Effects on the cumulative dose in preterm infants may be quite severe and independent of technical parameters.

One hundred images were acquired from a university hospital (site 1) and another 100 images were obtain from a community teaching hospital (site 2). We extracted demographical data from the case notes, including the length of gestation (weeks) and the age of the neonate on the date of the X-ray. Tube settings and exposure parameters, including tube voltage, tube current and dose-area product (DAP) were recorded. The radiography systems used were a Philips Mobile Diagnost (Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands) at site 1, and a Siemens Mobilette (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at site 2. The radiographers were noted, as well as their years of experience in performing X-rays. In addition, we recorded the presence of tubes and catheters as a surrogate of disease severity. The data were anonymised before image evaluation. Radiographs used for the study were included sequentially and not preselected. We did not take the diagnosis into account. Both hospitals monitored the rate of repeat X-rays. Repeat images on neonates were not allowed without the permission of a consultant radiologist. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. For this type of study formal consent was not required. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study."

They determined the most superior and inferior parts of the body, as well as the lateral structures, which had been included within the boundaries of collimation on each chest X-ray. The readers performed their evaluations according to the European Guidelines on Quality Criteria for Diagnostic Radiographic Images in Paediatrics [12]. A grading system was used to measure image quality in terms of correct collimation. Inappropriate exposure of abdominal viscera was assumed when the caudal imaging field extended below the level of L1/2 (1 point). Exposure of the cranial structures was considered inappropriate when the collimated field included more than the tip of the mandible (1 point). Inappropriate exposure of the arms was assumed when more than the diametaphyseal junction of the proximal humerus came within the field of view: part of the diaphyseal humerus (1 point); entire humerus (2 points); part of the forearm (1 point); entire forearm (2 points); hand (1 point). The maximum score was 12 points. The image quality in terms of correct collimation was graded arbitrarily as follows: 0 points = optimal image quality; 1-2 points = slightly reduced; 3-4 = moderately reduced; 5-6 = markedly reduced; and >7 points = severely reduced ( Fig. 1). Rotation and tilting were also recorded. Radiographic errors were recorded on individual tick sheets and the information was captured in an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

Collimation reduces the volume of tissue irradiated and decreases patient exposure. It also reduces the amount of scatter radiation produced (although the effect in neonates is relatively small compared to adults). However, reduction of scatter radiation reaching the image receptor increases image contrast and quality. Including extra-thoracic structures in the field does not usually provide any useful information on a chest X-ray but may result in a substantial increase in radiation exposure."

In a survey of 493 radiographers, Morrison et al. found that patient motion is by far the most common reason for repeat exposures in all services. Other causes such as poor positioning, anatomical clipping, artefacts, and underexposure were much more commonly described in radiography services not based in children's hospitals. They concluded that the risk of patient movement encourages many technologists to widen their collimation with infants and children, in order to capture all the necessary anatomy. The ease of repeating examinations immediately with direct radiography may also contribute to an increased tendency to repeat less-than-perfect exposures [16]. However, compared with infants in general, motion was certainly a less important issue in the neonates investigated in our study and the repeat rates monitored were comparably low at the two institutions.",

We found, somewhat unexpectedly, that the number of optimal images for each individual radiographer differed considerably. This phenomenon was not, however, significantly correlated to the years of experience in performing X-rays. Other intrinsic factors, such as educational level and awareness of the radiographer, may be responsible for the large variation observed. However, while these factors are difficult to measure on an objective basis, our results support the idea of individualised training for radiographers, to improve image quality and decrease radiation doses in paediatric radiography."

The rate of poorly collimated images (5.4%) was lower than we found in our study. However, their evaluation did not include any portable X-rays in neonates. They concluded that continuing education is needed on a regular basis (e.g. every 2 months).
