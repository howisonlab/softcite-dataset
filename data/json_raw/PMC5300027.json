Background: The association between sympathoadrenal activation, endotheliopathy, and poor outcome in trauma has only been demonstrated in smaller patient cohorts and animal models but needs confirmation in a large independent patient cohort. Methods: Prospective observational study of 424 trauma patients admitted to a level 1 Trauma Center. Admission plasma levels of catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline) and biomarkers reflecting endothelial damage (syndecan-1, thrombomodulin, and sE-selectin) were measured and demography, injury type and severity, physiology, treatment, and mortality up till 28 days were recorded. Results: Patients had a median ISS of 17 with 72% suffering from blunt injury. Adrenaline and noradrenaline correlated with syndecan-1 (r \u00bc 0.38, P<0.001 and r \u00bc 0.23, P<0.001, respectively) but adrenaline was the only independent predictor of syndecan-1 by multiple linear regression adjusted for age, injury severity score, Glascow Coma Scale, systolic blood pressure, base excess, platelet count, hemoglobin, prehospital plasma, and prehospital fluids (100 pg/mL higher adrenaline predicted 2.75 ng/mL higher syndecan-1, P < 0.001). By Cox analyses adjusted for age, sex, injury severity score, Glascow Coma Scale, base excess, platelet count and hemoglobin, adrenaline, and syndecan-1 were the only independent predictors of both < 24-hours, 7day and 28-day mortality (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, noradrenaline was an independent predictor of < 24-hours mortality and thrombomodulin was an independent predictor of 7-day and 28-day mortality (all P < 0.05). Conclusions: We confirmed that sympathoadrenal activation was strongly and independently associated with endothelial glycocalyx and cell damage (ie, endotheliopathy) and furthermore that sympathoadrenal activation and endotheliopathy were independent predictors of mortality in trauma patients."

            "text": "The introduction of the cell based model of hemostasis in the late 1990 s taught us that to adequately assess hemostatic competence whole blood that includes blood cellular elements should be used 6 and consequently, assays reflecting this were required. When studying trauma patients at admission with whole blood thrombelastography (TEG), we found that with increasing injury severity, the hemostatic profile became progressively more hypocoagulable and hyperfibrinolytic, which seemed counterintuitive given the substantial risk of exsanguination these patients faced. 7 To fully comprehend these findings, we speculated that the endothelium should also be included as a pivotal part of the vascular compartment and we hypothesized that the hemostatic changes observed in whole blood represented an evolutionary adapted response to a potential life-threatening condition. 8 The vascular endothelium comprises a single layer of cells that lines every vessel in the body, covers a total surface area of 5000 m 2 and has a total weight of 1 kg. 9 On the luminal part of the endothelium lays the endothelial glycocalyx, a 0.2 to 1 mm thick negatively charged antiadhesive and anticoagulant carbohydrate-rich surface layer that protects the endothelium and maintains vascular barrier function. [10][11][12] The endothelium is instrumental for balancing hemostasis and for maintaining the homeostasis between the circulating blood and the extravascular space/surrounding tissues. 13,14 Furthermore, given the immediate nature of changes in hemostatic competence in severely injured trauma patients we further speculated that activation of the sympathoadrenal activation, with release of large amounts of catecholamines was an important driver of this condition. 8 In independent, but small, studies of trauma patients, we found that (i) high circulating syndecan-1, a marker of endothelial glycocalyx degradation, 15 was associated with inflammation, hypocoagulability, and increased mortality; 16 (ii) the trauma-induced catecholamine surge was closely associated with biomarkers of tissue and endothelial damage, glycocalyx degradation, hypocoagulability including hyperfibrinolysis and independently predicted mortality; 17 and (iii) the syndecan-1 levels decreased after resuscitation with plasma. 18 We also found that an important determinant of the hypocoagulability observed by whole blood TEG, in these patients, was because of endogenous heparinization induced by the constituents released from the glycocalyx in response to the trauma and shock. 19 Collectively, these data indicated that endothelial damage and/or dysfunction significantly contributed to outcome and that sympathoadrenal activation was an important driver of early shock induced coagulopathy. 20 Introduction of early administration of plasma and platelets along with red blood cells (RBCs) to trauma patients with severe hemorrhage, not only reduced early deaths caused by exsanguination 21 but also led to a reduction in development of multiple organ failure. 22 Interestingly, Kozar et al 23 found in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock that resuscitation with plasma, as opposed to normal saline, had an endothelial-and glycocalyx rejuvenating effect related to increased mRNA levels of Syndecan-1 in the endothelial cells. More recently, adiponectin was identified as an important component in FFP to attenuate endothelial damage and improve lung vascular barrier function in mice after shock and resuscitation and collectively, these data suggest a pivotal role of the endothelium for outcome in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock. 24,25 The aim of the current study was therefore to validate and confirm our preliminary findings presented above in a larger, and independent, cohort of trauma patients and to more comprehensively characterize the endothelium by analyzing also soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), an endothelial cell damage marker, and soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), an endothelial cell activation marker, which both have been significantly associated with poor outcome in patients with other types of acute critical illness.

            "text": "mortality at 30 days. 27 From a pathophysiological and mechanistic point of view, it could be speculated that the increased shedding of glycocalyx results in an increased activation and damage of the endothelial cells resulting in a prothrombotic phenotype that leads to microvascular thrombosis and ensuing organ failure. 8 Here, this is supported by an independent association of the endothelial cellular damage marker sTM and increased 7-day and 28-day mortality. Johansen et al 26 reported in patients with sepsis that the level of sTM independently predicted organ failure of the liver and the kidneys and multiorgan failure and mortality; and in resuscitated out of hospital cardiac arrest patients, sTM was also a strong and independent predictor of 30-day mortality. 28 Moreover, loss of endothelial integrity causes capillary leakage with fluid extravasation, hypotension and shock, and in the current study we found that lower systolic blood pressure and BE were strongly associated with circulating syndecan-1, supporting this notion. Traumatic injury immediately activates the sympathoadrenal system with release of large amounts of catecholamines that exert widespread dose-dependent effects on metabolism and the vascular system. 32,33 We proposed that patients with excessive trauma activation, the sympathoadrenal system becomes maladaptive and contribute to organ damage. 8 Thus, in high concentrations, catecholamines directly damage the endothelium resulting in local edema, endothelial cell swelling, necrosis, and progressive deendothelialization. 34 In the current study, we found that plasma catecholamines correlated strongly with plasma syndecan-1 and higher adrenaline was the only independent predictor of higher syndecan-1 levels. Moreover, the combined highest level plasma adrenaline, injury severity, and transfusions (and mortality) was associated with excessively increased syndecan-1, confirming our previous findings that sympathoadrenal activation is of critical importance for development of traumatic endotheliopathy. Furthermore, adrenaline and syndecan-1 were independent predictors of early <24-hours mortality and late 7-day and 28-day mortality, whereas sTM only independently predicted 7-day and 28-day mortality. The finding here, of a strong correlation between levels of catecholamines upon admission and outcome, is in alignment with findings from other patient groups suffering from acute critical illness. In patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we reported that high plasma adrenaline was associated with increased 7-day, 30-day, and 180-day mortality. 28 Similarly, in patients with acute myocardial infarction, stratified into quartiles based on plasma adrenaline levels, one quartile higher plasma adrenaline was independently associated with both increased 30-day and long-term mortality. 27 In patients with varying degree of infection, including sepsis, we also found that catecholamines together with syndecan-1 and sTM independently predicted increased 28-day mortality. 28 According to our proposed hypothesis, sympathoadrenal activation is a pivotal driver of the traumatic endotheliopathy, so modulation of this response by limiting the catecholamine surge, is expected to be beneficial for outcome in these patients. Interestingly, Bukur et al 35 recently reported that in 663 critically injured patients (ISS!25) admitted to the intensive care unit, those 98 patients receiving beta-blockers upon admission, had significantly lower inhospital mortality (11% vs 19%, P \u00bc 0.006). Stepwise logistic regression identified beta-blocker use as an independent protective factor for mortality these patients. Similarly, Cotton et al 36 reported that in patients with severe traumatic brain injury, beta-blocker exposure before the trauma was associated with a significant reduction in mortality, which was even more impressive, considering that the group on beta-blocker therapy was older, more severely injured, and had lower predicted survival than the comparators. 36 Together, these findings support that downstream effects of excessive sympathoadrenal activation may also be harmful in  0.0",

The current study has important limitations inherent to its design. Being an observational study precludes from cause and effect conclusions but merely points towards significant associations that requires further investigation. Moreover, as a single-center study, this limits the generalizability of the results, although our findings here support previous reports from independent trauma cohorts. 16,18,19 Furthermore, the selection of biomarkers analyzed in this study does not preclude that other markers may also be of importance for the development and progression of traumatic endotheliopathy. Unique for the current study $10% of the patients received transfusions prehospital and the median prehospital crystalloid use was 0. This may have influenced the levels of endothelial biomarkers at admission given that administration of crystalloids has been shown to increase the circulating levels of these markers and contribute to endothelial damage.",
