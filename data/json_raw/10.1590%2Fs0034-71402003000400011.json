This paper estimates the Brazilian NAIRU (Nonaccelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) and investigates several empirical questions: the stability of coefficients of the Brazilian price Phillips curve, the behavior of the NAIRU along time, and error bands for the NAIRU. This article innovates, with respect to previous research work done for Brazil, because it estimates error bands for the NAIRU and adopts econometric models that, in our judgment, deal more adequately with the still recent instability of the Brazilian economy. We estimate two different state-space models: one with a time-varying NAIRU and another in which the NAIRU is changing over time according to a hidden Markov chain specification."

It concludes that there is a statistically significant relationship, with correct sign, between deviations of unemployment from the NAIRU and inflation. It also shows that, after the second semester of 1995, there is no significant evidence that the NAIRU has been different from the observed unemployment rate."

            "text": "Estimating the relationship between nominal and real variables in Brazil is a very hard task due to the instability experienced by the Brazilian economy in its recent past. The macroeconomic models are estimated using information provided by time series data, and the number of required observations outnumbers what is available for the most recent period of stability after the Real Plan. This is a challenge for anyone who works with Brazilian macroeconomic data. The great instability of the Brazilian economy, especially when the nominal side is modeled, makes it crucial to deal with structural breaks. The strong nominal shocks faced by the economy at different periods and at the beginning of the many stabilization plans point in the direction of using models that allow for large breaks and frequent alternations of the states of the economy. Portugal et al. (1999) estimate two different models for the Brazilian NAIRU. The first model is a traditional Phillips curve with constant intercept, autoregressive residuals and dummies to allow for structural breaks. The second model is a univariate structural model with trend and cycle, Harvey (1989), in which the NAIRU is defined as the trend component. The definition of the NAIRU, used in the second model, is questionable and in the literature (Staiger et al., 2001, Cogley and Sargent, 2001, Hall, 1999 there is a distinction between the natural rate of unemployment, usually defined as the unemployment trend, and the NAIRU.",

We estimate two different models to calculate the natural rate of unemployment and its confidence interval: one model with a time-varying NAIRU and another model in which the NAIRU is changing over time according to a hidden Markov chain specification. The first model allows for the presence of ARCH residuals; the second model allows for persistent heteroscedasticity 1 as well as a richer pattern of time variation for the NAIRU. We could not reject the absence of ARCH residuals in the first model under the maintained hypothesis of a time-varying NAIRU. Under the specification for the second model, we could not reject the presence of both Markov-switching heteroscedasticity and a time-varying NAIRU. A detailed description of both models and of the estimation methods can be found in Kim and Nelson (1999). The models were estimated using quarterly data for the average rate of open unemployment in six Metropolitan Regions and for the rate of inflation measured by the national consumer price index (INPC) in eleven Metropolitan Regions (including the six regions where unemployment is measured), both collected by IBGE for the period 1982:1 -2001:4.",

            "text": "For many researchers, the NAIRU is a synonym for the natural rate of unemployment. However, we find it convenient to separate these two concepts, just as do many others (Staiger et al. (2001), Cogley and Sargent (2001), Hall (1999) (1968) presidential address to the American Economic Association: \"The natural rate of unemployment is the level which would be ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations, provided that there is embedded in them the actual structural characteristics of the labor and commodity markets, including market imperfections, stochastic variability in demands and supplies, the cost of gathering information about job vacancies and labor availabilities, the costs of mobility, and so on\". The main point of Friedman's address was to argue that there was no permanent (long-run) tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. His definition does not require the existence of a short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff. Therefore, there is a natural rate of unemployment, even in the absence of any short-run unemployment-inflation tradeoff. Besides, as pointed out by Rogerson (1997), his definition is not inconsistent with the natural rate of unemployment being equal to the low frequency (trend) movements in unemployment. The NAIRU concept, on the other hand, needs the view (a view which is very prominent among central bankers and monetary economists) that there is a short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff. Even though, for many economists, the existence of this short-run tradeoff is purely speculative, its existence is one of the most enduring ideas in macroeconomics: shocks in monetary policy push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions in the short run. If this tradeoff is admitted, there must be some level of unemployment (NAIRU) consistent with constant inflation. Therefore, if a contractionary shock in monetary policy increases unemployment above the NAIRU, the inflation rate will decrease, and if an expansionary monetary shock decreases the unemployment rate below the NAIRU, the inflation rate will increase.",

In this model the NAIRU (\u016b) is \u2212\u03b1/\u03b2. This relationship for Brazil, from 1982:I-2001:IV, is illustrated by the scatterplot in figure 1. The horizontal axis shows the average rate of open unemployment in quarter t and the vertical axis shows the difference between the monthly inflation rate in quarter t and the monthly inflation rate in quarter t-1. Figure 1 also plots the OLS, ordinary least squares, regression line -the simple model -estimated over the full sample.

This lack of control for other factors may explain why both coefficient of the regression line are not significantly different from zero. Figure 2 is identical to figure 1 but shows data from 1995:1-2001:IV, which is the period after the Real Plan with much lower inflation. Figure 2 shows no evident relationship between inflation change and unemployment. One possible explanation is the absence of the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment under low inflation. However, we will show that this relationship can still be recovered from the most recent data if a more complicated model, one with time-varying parameters, is adopted.",

The one-step ahead forecast is obtained using the full sample to estimate the parameters that enter the numerical optimization routine (5 parameters for the TVP model and 8 parameters for the MSR model). Fixing the parameters, that enters the optimization routine, at their maximizing levels, the other 9 parameters used in the one-step ahead forecast for period t use, in their estimation, only observations up to t \u2212 1. Table 1 presents the log likelihood for the simplified selected MSR model (with the above restrictions)as 121.09 and for the initial MSR model (without these restrictions)as 121.26. Furthermore, as table 1 shows, if we impose the additional restriction of no time-varying intercept in state 1 (stable NAIRU), the number of parameters drops from 8 to 7 but the log likelihood drops from 121.09 to 113.14. Therefore, we cannot reject the stability of coefficients of the Brazilian price Phillips curve but, given this stability, we can reject a constant NAIRU.

Nevertheless, as it has been pointed out by Engel and Hamilton (1990), if the information matrix is singular in the region of the parameter space where the MSR model becomes the TVP model, then the standard regularity conditions needed to establish asymptotically valid hypothesis tests are not satisfied. Therefore, we cannot test, using the usual tests, which of the models better fits the data and the results, for both models are going to be presented.",

When the hypothesis p 11 = 1 \u2212 p 22 is imposed to the MSR model, there is no longer a Markov-switching process and the rate of inflation is an i.i.d. sequence with individual densities given by a mixture of two normals. We are able to reject both hypotheses, at a significance level smaller than 1%, using the likelihood ratio and Wald tests.  Engel and Hamilton (1990) We did not detect significant serial correlation, in the MSR model, for either the standardized one-step ahead forecast error or the squares of the standardized one-step ahead forecast errors. Nevertheless, the same is not true for the TVP model. Tables 6 and 7 present these tests.   Figure 5 shows the smoothed estimates of the NAIRU for the TVP and MSR models, as defined in section 2, and its confidence intervals computed from the smoothed estimates of \u03b2 * and of Var(\u03b2 * ), at each period t. The confidence intervals for the NAIRU were computed from 1,000 extractions of the distribution of the estimator of \u03b2 * and, in each extraction, the NAIRU was computed as explained in section 2.   After the Real Plan, there is growing evidence of the presence of seasonality in the unemployment data. Therefore, we also have estimated both previously selected models, with seasonally adjusted unemployment data 8 .

There is a significant and negative response of inflation to an increase in cyclical unemployment. Nevertheless the effect is not measured with high precision if we consider model uncertainty. The response of annual inflation to 0.5% cyclical unemployment that is persistent for 3 quarters belongs, with a 95% degree of confidence, to the (\u221211%, \u22127.5%) interval for the TVP model and to the (\u22126%, \u22124%) interval for the MSR model. The two models do not allow for time-varying coefficients for lag unemployment and lag inflation. Therefore, it cannot be rejected that the deviations of the rate of unemployment from the NAIRU can have a significant effect, with correct sign, on the rate of inflation. Nevertheless, it is also true that the above estimates of the effect are not very precise. If we consider the uncertainty with respect to what the right model is, then any value between \u221211% and \u22124% cannot be rejected."

Observing figures 5 and 6 we can conclude that the estimates of the NAIRU, considering both models, are very imprecise and that from the second quarter of 1995 the estimated value of the NAIRU is contained within its error bands and therefore it cannot be rejected that the observed rate of unemployment was equal to the NAIRU."

It should be pointed out that, during a good part of the period of high inflation faced by Brazil, the rate of unemployment was systematically below the error bands estimated for the NAIRU. Therefore, there was a continuous uptrend in the rate of inflation, whose upward trajectory was only broken by the stabilization plans. This is true for the MSR model from the beginning of 1985 until the second semester of 1995. For the TVP model, this is true from the beginning of 1986 to the beginning of 1991. It is also interesting to note that the two models indicate that there was a decrease in the NAIRU from 1994 until the middle of 1995, when it started increasing again until it reached values next to its previous 1994 level by 1999. The NAIRU has been decreasing since the year 2000."
