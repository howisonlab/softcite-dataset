            "text": "Human resource management is one of the newest ap proaches of personnel management which, as well as changed approach to personnel, results from social changes at the end of the 20 th century that affects all private and public spheres of life. The basis of this management consists in an effort of senior managers to change personality traits of supervised employees following the objectives of an en terprise (Bolf\u00edkov\u00e1 et al. 2010), to create positive approach to their work, work team and at last also to identify with the corporate culture, its strategy and with the objectives of an enterprise (Bla\u0161kov\u00e1, Grazulis 2009). The issue of human resource management is connected to the issue of its utilisation in the context of outsourcing principles (Potk\u00e1ny 2011;Vetr\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2011) and process audit (Z\u00e1vadsk\u00e1 et al. 2013). Personnel controlling tries to find its position in the area of motivation too. In a narrow sense, its character is quantitative and operative and it evaluates effi ciency of personnel processes. In a broad sense, it monitors the quality of human resource management, its tools and practices (Kuchar\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 2014). Different parameters and indicators are required by personnel controlling to manage different personnel processes (Potk\u00e1ny et al. 2012).",

            "text": "A man became the most important and the most ex pensive factor of production in an enterprise, its main asset which, if an enterprise wants to exist, run and develop, must be used to achieve goals very carefully. In order to meet these requirements, employees must be motivated by the enterprise (Bivainis, Morkv\u0117nas 2008). If we want to achieve successful results when managing people, negotiating or their reaction predicting we must respect differences among people (Stacho et al. 2013;Teplick\u00e1 2004). It means their intrinsic motivation must be influenced by motivational tools, methods and techniques (Ska\u010dkauskien\u0117, Kiselevskaja 2014). The aim of the paper is to define terms like age, educa tion and seniority and their impact on the level of employee motivation and in case of some significant differences to propose the way of employee motivation. Some changes in the area of motivation could be observed in the research conducted in Slovenia and Croatia (Kropiv\u0161ek et al. 2011). The research was carried out in the year 2012. We also tried to prove or to disprove the statement that considering the age, completed education and seniority the motivation re quirements of employees change. Following the Maslow's hierarchy of needs we suppose that requirements of employ ees that are fulfilled will become unnecessary. Hereby, we suppose that employees with better education and greater seniority will prefer different motivation factors than em ployees with lower education and less seniority. Main hy pothesis is the presumption that mentioned factors affect the level of employee motivation and employers can affect employee performance actively through their knowledge. Mentioned facts are described also by Bla\u0161kov\u00e1 (2010) and by Jela\u010di\u0107, Moro, Dr\u00e1bek, Sujov\u00e1 (2012).",

Without appropriate level of motivated behaviour and activity we cannot determine goals and re quire their meeting. Motivation is an important term com monly used to encourage people to carry out the assigned work with sincerity, dedication, and enthusiasm. Motivation is the tonic to provide additional energy to overcome the fatigue, disinterest and feelings to drop the job (Srivastava, Kakkar 2008). Considering the employee motivation their working results can be expected. Statement that the perfor mance depends mainly on human motivation is simplified especially because motivation is not the only factor affect ing the performance. Other factors affecting the employee performance are abilities, knowledge and skills of a man de termining their career growth potential (Korsakien\u0117 2011). Motivation can deviate depending upon meeting human needs, life situations, internal and external environment, etc. It can be caused by effect of different factors which influence motivation in different ways. In addition, these factors do not act separately but they create a system of specific rela tions that are mutually interconnected. At the present time the financial crisis in enterprises and countries' economies makes the process of motivation more difficult. Recession is a difficult period not only for employees but for employ ers as well. Employees with the key competences, respon sibilities should be able to motivate their team also during recession. When the first signs of the financial crisis appear in the organisation, most of traditional methods applied by the enterprise in the area of employee motivation before this period are not suitable for new situation or cannot be carried out at all. Incentives, extra holidays, corporate en tertaining and rewards as the most commonly used tools of motivation seem to be less important in the atmosphere of insecurity. During the recession employees lose mainly the sense of security. All employees are afraid of losing their jobs because mass layoff became one of the basic actions of the organisation to eliminate unfavourable impact of the crisis on the enterprise. If the organisation wants to keep employee productivity of its employees, their willingness to work, it is appropriate to offer them incentives and extra pay. However, we can say, in general, monetary incentives, as a motivation factor, have an important role only from a shortterm point of view.",

The questionnaire was divided into two parts. Sociodemographic and quali fication characteristics of employees were searched in the first part. Basic data about respondents relating to their age, sex, seniority, completed education and job position were obtained in this part. The second part consisted of individual motivation factors through which information about work environment, working conditions, applied appraisal and reward system, about personnel management, health and social care system and system of employee benefits as well as information about employee satisfaction or dissatisfac tion, value orientation, relation to work and enterprise or coworkers' relationship in the enterprise can be found out. Motivation factors are in alphabetical order not to affect respondents's decision. In the questionnaire respondents evaluated individual motivation factors by one of the five levels of importance from a predefined 5point rating scale, 5 -the most important and 1 -unimportant (Table 1) from a predefined evaluation scale (Table 1). Each motivation factor was marked by employees with one of five types of importance for required as well as for cur rent conditions. The required condition can be defined as an idea of employees how the motivation should look like, i.e. what would motivate them to increase their performance. The current conditions represents the employees' opinion how they are satisfied with current motivation in the enterprise. The questionnaires were evaluated using the programme STATISTICA 7 (Statsoft 2004). Descriptive statistics was used to describe the primary sampling unit. Statistical character istics, which compressed information about studied primary sampling units into smaller number of numerical character istics and made mutual comparison of sampling units easier, were computed for each motivation factor. Each motivation factor was described in summary by basic characteristics of size and variability of quantitative features -average x \uf077 , stand ard deviations s x and coefficients of variation. Subsequently the results of the enterprises were compared.",

Regarding the completed education we can state that despite different order of importance of mo tivation factors there were not seen differences in the level of employee motivation, too. Finally we can state that at the present time the motivational programme can be proposed on the basis of the average importance of individual motiva tion factors unifiedly. However, differences are more likely to exist also among employees themselves. The differences can be analysed by cluster analysis to define groups of em ployees motivated in a similar way. Moreover, in the future motivation requirements of employees can also change after meeting their needs. Therefore we suggest the enterprise to update motivational programme from time to time.",
