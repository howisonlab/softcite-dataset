            "text": "Cytoplasmic dynein is a 1.2-MD multisubunit motor complex that powers movement of various cargoes toward the minus ends of microtubules. This ancient and highly conserved ATPase organizes the intracellular environment throughout the cell cycle; however, its myriad roles become especially apparent during mitosis when it functions in various aspects of spindle morphogenesis and positioning (Rusan et al., 2002;Goshima et al., 2005;Yang et al., 2007;Ferenz et al., 2009;Siller and Doe, 2009). For instance, cortically anchored dynein motors position the spindle at the future site of cytokinesis (Eshel et al., 1993;Li et al., 1993;Carminati and Stearns, 1997), a process that is particularly important during asymmetric cell divisions, when spindle position dictates the plane of cell division, and thus cell fate determination (Pease and Tirnauer, 2011;Williams et al., 2011). The means by which dynein is delivered to the cell cortex and subsequently activated to pull on astral microtubules emanating from spindle poles to move the spindle are unclear.",

During the meiotic prophase in fission yeast, studies suggest that dynein first binds along astral microtubules that are in close proximity to the cell cortex (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013). Rather than walking toward the minus end of these microtubules, dynein undergoes one-dimensional diffusion until it encounters Mcp5, its cortical anchor. Once bound to Mcp5, dynein mo-tors switch from diffusive to directed motion and consequently move the spindle appropriately. Thus, in addition to anchoring dynein at the cortex, Mcp5 appears to activate dynein motility by an unknown mechanism.",

            "text": "A similar but somewhat distinct scenario takes place in budding yeast, in which dynein is first targeted to the plus ends of astral microtubules before being offloaded to cortical Num1 (Mcp5 homologue) receptor sites, where it functions to move the mitotic spindle toward the daughter cell (Adames and Cooper, 2000;Lee et al., 2005;. It is unknown if dynein motility is activated subsequent to offloading; however, several lines of evidence suggest that its activity is switched from being off at plus ends to being on at the cell cortex. For instance, in spite of its minus end-directed motility, dynein is transported to, and remains associated with, the plus ends of dynamic microtubules (Lee et al., 2003;Carvalho et al., 2004). Plus end targeting requires the dynein motor domain, the +TIP (plus end-tracking protein) Bik1 (CLIP-170 homologue), and the dynein-associated factor Pac1 (homologue of human LIS1; Lee et al., 2003;Sheeman et al., 2003;Markus et al., 2009). Recent studies suggest that Pac1 plays two distinct and important roles in targeting dynein to plus ends. First, Pac1 mediates the interaction between dynein and plus end-bound Bik1 (Sheeman et al., 2003;Roberts et al., 2014). Second, by inhibiting dynein motility Huang et al., 2012), and/or by prolonging its microtubule attachment (Yamada et al., 2008; Cortically anchored dynein orients the spindle through interactions with astral microtubules. In budding yeast, dynein is offloaded to Num1 receptors from microtubule plus ends. Rather than walking toward minus ends, dynein remains associated with plus ends due in part to its association with Pac1/LIS1, an inhibitor of dynein motility. The mechanism by which dynein is switched from \"off\" at the plus ends to \"on\" at the cell cortex remains unknown. Here, we show that overexpression of the coiled-coil domain of Num1 specifically depletes dynein-dynactin-Pac1/LIS1 complexes from microtubule plus ends and reduces dynein-Pac1/LIS1 colocalization. Depletion of dynein from plus ends requires its microtubule-binding domain, suggesting that motility is required. An enhanced Pac1/LIS1 affinity mutant of dynein or overexpression of Pac1/LIS1 rescues dynein plus end depletion. Live-cell imaging reveals minus end-directed dyneindynactin motility along microtubules upon overexpression of the coiled-coil domain of Num1, an event that is not observed in wild-type cells. Our findings indicate that dynein activity is directly switched \"on\" by Num1, which induces Pac1/LIS1 removal.",

Recent studies indicated that purified metazoan dynein is functional for motility in ensemble assays (e.g., microtubule gliding) but requires a stable interaction with the dynactin complex for single-molecule processivity (McKenney et al., 2014;Schlager et al., 2014). Stabilization of the dynein-dynactin interaction by various coiled-coil-containing adaptor proteins (e.g., BicD2, Spindly, Hook3, and Rab11-Fip3) is sufficient to significantly enhance dynein processivity, and thereby \"activate\" dynein motility. This is in contrast to budding yeast dynein, which is processive in the absence of dynactin or other adaptors or regulators (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006). It is unclear whether such a mechanism generally governs dynein regulation within a cell, given that certain functions of dynein in animal cells, such as centrosome anchoring, pole focusing, and spindle length regulation, have been shown to occur independently of several such adaptors (Raaijmakers et al., 2013). It is also unclear whether dynactin-mediated processivity enhancement is the means by which cortical dynein activity is promoted. Interestingly, plus end association of dynein in higher eukaryotes, which occurs in a dynactin-dependent manner, does not require such adaptor proteins (Splinter et al., 2012;Duellberg et al., 2014). Given the lack of minus end-directed motility of these plus endassociated dynein motors, an interaction between dynein and dynactin is not necessarily sufficient to active dynein motility.",

            "text": "Using budding yeast, we aimed to test the hypothesis that binding of dynein-dynactin to its cortical receptor provides the switch that activates cortical dynein activity. Dynein pathway function is best understood in this genetically tractable organism, in which many of the regulatory components and accessory chains, which are each encoded by only one gene, are highly conserved. We found that overexpression of the dynein-dynactininteracting coiled-coil domain of Num1 (Num1 CC ) is sufficient to activate dynein motility, causing a depletion of dynein-dynactin from microtubule plus ends, their accumulation at minus ends, and their apparent minus end-directed motility along astral microtubules. Our data reveal that the mechanism for this activation is likely a Num1 CC -mediated release of Pac1, a potent dynein inhibitor, from the dynein motor domain."

            "text": "A recent study revealed that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of Num1-the dynein cortical receptor-directly interacts with dynein-dynactin complexes (Tang et al., 2012). If this region of Num1 (Num1 CC ; Fig. 1 A) is sufficient to activate dynein motility, we reasoned that its overexpression would result in (a) the depletion of dynein and dynactin from microtubule plus ends, and (b) an accumulation of dynein-dynactin at spindle pole bodies (SPBs), where microtubule minus ends are anchored ( Fig. 1 B). We found this latter phenomenon to be an inherent property of dynein motility, because single-molecule motility experiments demonstrated that upon reaching the end of a microtubule, dynein pauses for several seconds before detaching, much longer than the dwell time of \u223c0.1 s per step ( Fig. S1 and Video 1). To test our hypothesis, we engineered yeast cells such that the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter (GAL1p) was immediately upstream of a truncated num1 CC allele (Fig. 1 C). Because Num1 CC is expressed from the native NUM1 locus, these cells do not possess a full-length Num1. Consequently, dynein and dynactin are excluded from the cell cortex and are unable to properly orient the spindle in these cells.",

            "text": "In the absence of Num1 CC induction (by growth in glucose-containing media), we observed fluorescent foci of functional Dyn1-(dynein heavy chain) and Jnm1-3mCherry (p50 subunit of dynactin) fusions  at microtubule plus ends in 77.2% and 41.4% of cells, respectively (Fig. 1,D and E). In contrast, upon induction of Num1 CC overexpression (by growth in galactose-containing media), the number of cells exhibiting Dyn1-and Jnm1-3mCherry plus end foci was reduced by approximately fivefold, to 14.8% and 8.1%, respectively. Fluorescence intensity measurements revealed that those plus ends with Dyn1-and Jnm1-3mCherry foci had significantly fewer molecules of each upon Num1 CC overexpression ( Fig. 1 F). Coincident with the reduction in plus end dynein and dynactin, we also observed a four-to fivefold increase in the number of cells with Dyn1-and Jnm1-3mCherry foci at SPBs upon Num1 CC induction (also see Fig. 4 A, bottom). We observed similar results for Pac11-(dynein intermediate chain) and Dyn3-3mCherry (dynein light-intermediate chain; Fig. S2, A-E). In contrast, overexpression of Num1 CC had no effect on the extent of plus end localization of Bik1-3mCherry (CLIP170 homologue), a protein that is required for the plus end targeting of dynein (Fig. S2, F and G;Sheeman et al., 2003). To determine whether there is a cell cycle-regulated component to Num1 CC -mediated dynein relocalization, we categorized plus end and SPB localization frequencies into the following: G1, preanaphase, and anaphase (as determined by cell and spindle morphology; see Fig. S2 H). Although both G1 and preanaphase cells exhibited an equivalent extent of Num1 CC -mediated dynein relocalization, we found that anaphase cells were less susceptible to dynein plus end depletion, in spite of a significant enhancement in the prevalence of SPB localized dynein in these cells ( Fig. S2 H). These findings are consistent with the higher frequency of dynein plus end localization noted in wild-type anaphase cells (Sheeman et al., 2003;Markus et al., 2009), and they further suggest that the plus end targeting mechanism is more robust at this point of the cell cycle. Collectively, our data indicate that overexpression of Num1 CC specifically depletes dynein-dynactin from microtubule plus ends.",

Yeast dynactin deletion mutants exhibit a complete loss of cortical dynein and a higher than normal accumulation of dynein at microtubule plus ends (Lee et al., 2003(Lee et al., , 2005. This latter observation is also noted in num1\u0394 mutants (Lee et al., 2003) and is presumed to be attributable to an inability to offload dynein-dynactin to cortical Num1 receptor sites. Finally, a bead-immobilized recombinant Num1 CC fragment was sufficient to isolate dynein from cell extracts but was unable to do so from extracts prepared from nip100\u0394 cells (homologue of human dynactin component p150Glued; Tang et al., 2012). To determine whether Num1 CC can deplete plus end dynein in the absence of dynactin, we overexpressed Num1 CC in nip100\u0394 Figure 1.

We found that Num1 CC overexpression reduced the frequency of dynein plus end localization in nip100\u0394 cells to a lesser extent than in NIP100 cells (Fig. S3, A and B; 38% reduction in nip100\u0394 vs. 81% reduction in NIP100 cells; compare with Fig. 1 E); however, fluorescence intensity measurements of plus end dynein revealed no significant difference ( Fig. S3 C).

To test this, we generated a dynein mutant lacking its microtubule-binding domain (MTBD; Dyn1 \u0394MT BD ; Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, we found that in the absence of Num1 CC induction, Dyn1 \u0394MT BD was capable of plus end binding (Fig. 3, B and C, top in B), indicating that dynein associates with plus ends independently of its MTBD, and thus likely through its interaction with Pac1 and Bik1. Furthermore, we found that the Interaction between dynein and Num1 CC is required for plus end depletion. (A) Schematic representation of the Num1 CC LL/EE mutant.

These data suggest that SPB localization of dynein in wild-type cells may be attributable to minus end-directed motility of active dynein motors. Consistent with our hypothesis, upon induction of Num1 CC overexpression, Dyn1 \u0394MT BD localization to plus ends and SPBs remained unchanged (Fig. 3, C and D), suggesting that Num1 CC -mediated depletion of dynein from plus ends and accumulation at SPBs both require dynein motility.",

Although dynein recruits dynactin to plus ends in a Num1-independent manner, dynactin is present at substoichiometric amounts relative to dynein (approximately three dynein to one dynactin; . Thus, we reasoned that Num1 CC may activate dynein motility by enhancing the dyneindynactin interaction at plus ends. To test this, we assessed the extent by which Num1 CC affects dynein-mediated recruitment of dynactin to plus ends. For these experiments, we used dyn1 \u0394MT BD mutant cells, in which dynein remains associated at plus ends in spite of Num1 CC overexpression (see Fig. 3, B-D). We found that Num1 CC overexpression had no effect on the frequency of observing plus end-localized dynactin (i.e., Jnm1or Nip100-3mCherry; Fig. 3, E-G); however, the fluorescence intensities of both Jnm1 and Nip100 at plus ends were modestly, but significantly, increased (Fig. 3 H; 58.9% and 30.9%, respectively; P \u2264 0.0012), suggesting that Num1 CC may in fact enhance or stabilize the dynein-dynactin interaction. However, given the small apparent change in dynein-dynactin interaction at plus ends, and the observation that yeast dynein processivity enhancement by dynactin does not require additional factors in vitro (i.e., Num1; Kardon et al., 2009), it is unclear whether stabilization of the dynein-dynactin interaction is the mechanism by which Num1 functions to activate dynein motility. For these reasons, we explored an alternative hypothesis.",

We hypothesized that Num1 CC may deplete dynein from plus ends by interfering with dynein-Pac1 binding. To test this, we assessed localization of a functional Pac1-3mCherry fusion  in cells overexpressing Num1 CC . As we observed for dynein and dynactin, Pac1-3mCherry foci were depleted from microtubule plus ends upon Num1 CC overexpression (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with their codependence for plus end targeting . However, in contrast to dynein and dynactin, the fraction of cells exhibiting Pac1-3mCherry foci at SPBs was reduced with respect to cells not expressing Num1 CC , suggesting that dynein localizes at SPBs without Pac1 upon Num1 CC overexpression. This reduction in localization was not due to a decrease in Pac1 protein expression or stability, as indicated by immunoblotting ( Fig. 4 D). Consistent with a Num1 CC -mediated reduction in the dynein-Pac1 interaction, we found that the fraction of Dyn1-3YFP and Pac1-3mCherry foci that colocalized (either SPB or plus end) was reduced upon induction of Num1 CC (from 59.6% to 26.2%; Fig. 4 E), whereas the fraction of Dyn1-3YFP foci alone (i.e., not colocalized with Pac1) increased (from 28.3% to 62.3%).

            "text": "We next wanted to determine whether the reduction in Pac1-dynein colocalization was a direct consequence of Num1 CC -mediated Pac1-dynein dissociation, or whether it was a secondary consequence of dynein plus end depletion. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we ectopically targeted dynein to the plasma membrane using an exogenous pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and we assessed the degree of colocalization of Pac1 with cortical PH-Dyn1 in the presence of either Num1 CC LL/EE or Num1 CC . We found that the PH domain was sufficient to target dynein ( Fig. 4 F and Fig. S4 A) and dynactin (i.e., Jnm1; Fig. S4 B) to the cell cortex in cells lacking cortical Num1. Interestingly, we found a greater frequency of cortical PH-Dyn1-3mCherry foci in Num1 CC -overexpressing cells than in either Num1 CC LL/EE -overexpressing cells (45.5% vs. 13.9%, respectively) or NUM1 cells (21.3%; not depicted). In addition, we noted that Num1 CC -overexpressing cells exhibited larger cortical patches than either wild-type NUM1 or Num1 CC LL/EEoverexpressing cells (Fig. S4 A; data not depicted). These data suggest that PH-Dyn1-Num1 CC complexes may be oligomerizing at the cell cortex, which is consistent with the previously described role for the Num1 CC domain in the assembly of higher-order cortical patches (Tang et al., 2012). In cells overexpressing Num1 CC LL/EE , Pac1-3YFP colocalized with 65.3% of cortical PH-Dyn1-3mCherry foci; however, upon overexpression of Num1 CC , only 29.1% of PH-Dyn1-3mCherry foci contained Pac1-3YFP fluorescence (Fig. 4 G). Fluorescence intensity measurements also revealed a significant reduction in the number of Pac1 molecules associated with cortical PH-dynein patches (Fig. 4 H). In contrast, we noted no significant change in either the frequency or intensity of colocalized dynactin (i.e., Jnm1; Fig. 4, I and J; and Fig. S4 B). These data support the notion that Num1 CC disrupts the dynein-Pac1 interaction, thereby leading to the plus end depletion phenotype.",

To test the former, we used a yeast strain expressing a well-characterized, motility-competent dynein mutant (Dyn1 HL3 ) that exhibits higher affinity for Pac1 than wild-type dynein (Fig. 5 A; Markus and Lee, 2011). We predicted that Dyn1 HL3 and Pac1 would be less susceptible to Num1 CC -mediated plus end depletion as a result of their higher affinity. Consistent with our hypothesis, induction of Num1 CC overexpression reduced the frequency of observing Dyn1 HL3 -3YFP and Pac1-3mCherry plus end foci by 40% and 22%, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C), much less than what we observed in wild-type DYN1 cells (respective 81% and 67% reduction; compare with Fig. 1 E and  Fig. 4 B). Fluorescence intensity measurements revealed no significant change in the number of Dyn1 HL3 or Pac1 molecules at plus ends upon Num1 CC overexpression (Fig. 5 D).

These values are significantly less than the respective 78% and 37% reduction in frequency and intensity we observed when Num1 CC alone was overexpressed (compared with Num1 CC LL/EE ; Fig. 6, C and E).

            "text": "If Num1 CC depletes dynein from plus ends by inducing Pac1 release, then we reasoned that enhancing dynein plus end targeting by a Pac1-independent means would not be able to rescue plus end depletion to the same extent as Pac1 overexpression. To test this, we overexpressed Kip2, a kinesin-7 family member that affects steady-state microtubule length (see Fig. 6 A, bottom) and plays a role in transporting dynein to microtubule plus ends (Carvalho et al., 2004;Markus et al., 2009;Roberts et al., 2014). As with Pac1, we first established a baseline by which Kip2 overexpression enhances dynein plus end localization by imaging Dyn1-3mCherry in GAL1p:KIP2 GAL1p:num1 CC LL/EE cells. Consistent with a role for Kip2 in transporting dynein away from minus ends and toward plus ends, overexpression of Kip2 enhanced the frequency of dynein plus end targeting by 19% and reduced the frequency of SPB targeting by 83% (P = 0.0019; Fig. 6 B). Fluorescence intensity measurements revealed a robust 147% increase in the number of dynein molecules per plus end (Fig. 6 D). When both Kip2 and wild-type Num1 CC were overexpressed, the frequency and mean fluorescence intensity of plus end dynein was reduced by 59% (P < 0.0001) and 63% (P = 0.0012), respectively, compared with GAL1p:KIP2 GAL1p:num1 CC LL/EE cells (Fig. 6, B-E). The extent by which Kip2 overexpression reduces Num1 CCmediated plus end dynein depletion is therefore less than that of Pac1. Collectively, these data are consistent with our hypothesis, and they suggest that Num1 CC and Pac1 are competing for binding to dynein-dynactin complexes. It is interesting to note that Pac1 binds to dynein within the C-terminal motor domain (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006;Markus et al., 2009;Huang et al., 2012;Toropova et al., 2014), whereas Num1 associates with dynein via the N-terminal tail domain (Markus et al., 2009). Thus, interference with Dyn1-Pac1 binding by Num1 CC likely occurs by an allosteric mechanism.

We found that localization of Num1 CC to the SPB is largely dependent on dynein, and more specifically, the MTBD of dynein (Fig. S5, A and B). Furthermore, cells in which dynein plus end targeting is restored-by overexpression of Pac1, deletion of the dynein MTBD, or use of Dyn1 HL3 -exhibit Num1 CC at plus ends, albeit at a low frequency (Fig. S5, A-C). These data indicate that Num1 CC can bind plus end dynein (as well as the Dyn1 \u0394MT BD and Dyn1 HL3 mutants) and suggest that Num1 and Pac1 binding to dynein is not entirely mutually exclusive. The latter is consistent with the observation that Dyn1 HL3 -Pac1 complexes can offload together to Num1 cortical sites .",

Evidence of the latter is apparent by the movement of fluorescent dynein speckles along astral microtubules toward plus ends ( Fig. 7 A and Video 2; Markus et al., 2009). In budding yeast, dynein is never observed moving in the opposite direction-toward the minus ends of astral microtubules. Minus end-directed activity is only apparent when cortically anchored dynein motors move the spindle through interactions with astral microtubules. If depletion of dynein-dynactin from microtubule plus ends is a consequence of these motors being switched \"on,\" then we reasoned that cells overexpressing Num1 CC would exhibit dynein molecules moving in a directed manner toward the minus ends of astral microtubules, as was recently observed in fission yeast expressing a Mcp5 \u0394PH (Num1 homologue) fragment (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013).",

The reason for the latter is unclear but may be a result of disengagement of Num1 CC from dynein subsequent to activation. Taken together with our other observations (i.e., the lack of Pac1 accumulation at SPBs in Num1 CC -overexpressing cells, the reduced colocalization of Dyn1 and Pac1 in DYN1 and PH-DYN1 cells, and the ability of Pac1 overexpression to rescue Dyn1 plus end targeting), the apparent lack of minus end-directed Pac1 molecules further suggests that Num1 CC activates plus end dynein by relieving Pac1-mediated inhibition.

            "text": "When purified from various sources, including budding yeast and animal tissue, dynein motors are active as apparent from ATPase and microtubule gliding assays. Yeast dynein requires no additional factors for processive single-molecule motility (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006), whereas dynein isolated from animal tissue requires a combination of dynactin and various adaptor proteins that link dynein to dynactin (McKenney et al., 2014;Schlager et al., 2014). This latter phenomenon helps explain how dynein activity is recruited to different vesicular or organellar compartments in animal cells, and thus how dynein activity is regulated with spatial precision. For instance, one of these adaptors, BicD2, binds to Rab6 on various vesicular cargoes, and thereby recruits dynein-dynactin complexes, which allows for minus end-directed movements of these vesicular cargoes (Matanis et al., 2002). Although mechanistically distinct, we have identified a similar mechanism at play in budding yeast. Specifically, Num1-mediated recruitment of dynein-dynactin complexes to the cell cortex is sufficient to (a) anchor dynein-dynactin complexes at their site of activity, and (b) activate dynein for its spindle orientation function. Unlike animal cells, however, association with dynactin is not sufficient to activate dynein motility in yeast cells. Rather, our studies indicate that a Num1-mediated Pac1 dissociation event is responsible for switching dynein from being off at microtubule plus ends to on at the cell cortex.",

Given the reliance of dynein on dynactin for offloading to Num1 receptor sites (Lee et al., 2003), the limiting nature of dynactin at plus ends effectively restricts dynein pathway activity by limiting the number of cortical dynein-dynactin complexes. Increasing the number of intact dynein-dynactin complexes at plus ends by deletion of She1, which regulates their interaction in vivo (Woodruff et al., 2009), results in an increased number of cortical dynein-dynactin complexes, as well as enhanced dynein pathway activity .

At some point after or concomitant with dynein offloading, Pac1 dissociates from dynein and is never observed at cortical Num1 sites in wild-type cells (Lee et al., 2003). Given the observations presented here, we hypothesize that Num1 binding to dynein-dynactin triggers the dissociation of Pac1 from dynein. The fact that Dyn1 \u0394MT BD is insensitive to Num1 CC overexpression suggests that microtubule binding by dynein is a requisite for Pac1 dissociation. This suggests a mechanism whereby Num1 binding to the dynein tail domain (Markus et al., 2009) communicates allosteric changes to the motor head that, after microtubule binding, induce Pac1 dissociation from its binding site (at the junction between AAA3 and AAA4; Toropova et al., 2014) and consequently permit minus end-directed motility (see Fig. 8). The requisite microtubule binding by dynein for Num1 CC -mediated Pac1 dissociation likely explains the plus end colocalization of Dyn1 \u0394MT BD with Num1 CC (Fig. S5, A-C) and Pac1 (not depicted).",

In budding yeast, the dynein motor domain, Pac1, and Bik1 are absolutely essential (Lee et al., 2003;Sheeman et al., 2003;Markus et al., 2009), but dynactin is dispensable for this process (Lee et al., 2003). However, recent in vitro reconstitution experiments with human dynein revealed a distinct plus end binding complex that requires EB1, the p150Glued subunit of dynactin, and the full-length dynein complex (i.e., the motor domain is not sufficient; Duellberg et al., 2014). These latter observations, which did not describe any minus end-directed dynein motility, suggest that dynein and dynactin (or at least p150Glued) can interact at plus ends in the absence of the recently characterized adaptor proteins (e.g., Hook3, Spindly, and BicD2;McKenney et al., 2014;Schlager et al., 2014) and further suggest that their interaction is not sufficient for dynein motility.",

            "text": "Our observation that the MTBD of dynein is dispensable for plus end targeting was surprising and changes our understanding by which dynein recognizes and binds to microtubule plus ends. In light of this observation, we propose that dynein does not directly contact the plus end; rather, dynein associates with plus ends indirectly through its interactions with Pac1 and Bik1 (see Fig. 1 B). Evidence indicates that Pac1 enables dynein tip tracking in part by linking it to the plus end binding protein Bik1 (Sheeman et al., 2003;Roberts et al., 2014). Thus, the ability of Pac1 (and LIS1) to permit prolonged encounters between dynein and microtubules (McKenney et al., 2010;Huang et al., 2012) is likely unrelated to plus end binding by dynein in this organism. However, it is conceivable that by maintaining dynein in an off state at plus ends, Pac1 may prevent minus end motility of dynein motors that are in very close proximity to the microtubule. Upon binding of Num1 CC , dynein may pivot (likely in a stochastic manner) such that it may contact the plus end directly through its MTBD, subsequently release Pac1, and then walk toward the minus end. An analogous situation may take place in wild-type cells: after offloading to Num1 receptor sites at the cortex, dynein is well positioned to contact the microtubule to initiate spindle movements, which in turn may trigger Pac1 dissociation (Fig. 8). Recent structural studies support such a possibility: upon microtubule binding, conformational changes within the MTBD affect corresponding changes within the motor ring (Schmidt, 2015;Uchimura et al., 2015). These changes, which are propagated by the antiparallel coiled-coil that lead from the MTBD to the motor ring (via AAA4), could presumably affect Pac1 binding at the AAA3-AAA4 junction (see Fig. 8; Toropova et al., 2014).",

It is unclear why Dyn1 HL3 exhibits higher affinity for Pac1. This mutant was engineered such that a helical linker was inserted between the tail and motor domains Figure 8. Model for Num1-mediated activation of dynein-mediated spindle positioning. Our data suggest that at the moment of offloading (step 1), contact between dyneindynactin and cortical Num1 triggers a cascade of events that ultimately leads to Pac1 dissociation (step 3); however, the MTBD (deletion of which interrupts this process) is required to make contact with the microtubule to initiate Pac1 dissociation (step 2). . In the context of the tertiary structure of the dynein motor, this region lies in close proximity to the Pac1 binding site (between AAA3 and AAA4; see Fig. 5 A). Taken together with an apparent enhanced affinity of a tail-less dynein construct (motor domain only) for Pac1 (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006;Markus et al., 2009), it stands to reason that the tail domain plays a negative regulatory role in affecting Pac1 binding. Thus, whatever allosteric conformational change Num1 CCdynein tail binding induces is likely interrupted by insertion of the helical HL3 linker.",

In brief, primers were used to separately amplify the N-terminal (nucleotides 283-498, corresponding to amino acids 95-166) and C-terminal (nucleotides 511-909, corresponding to amino acids 171-303) portions of Num1 CC , such that the desired nucleotide substitutions were included in the reverse primer for the N-terminal portion and the forward primer for the C-terminal portion. After amplification, the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the PCR products corresponding to the N-and C-terminal regions, respectively, contained 20 nucleotides of sequence identity with each other, whereas the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the N-and C-terminal regions, respectively, contained 20 nucleotides of sequence identity with the NcoI-and NotI-digested pBSG02 vector. After digesting pBSG02 with NcoI and NotI (to excise Num1 CC(95-303) wild type), the gelpurified PCR products and digested vector were assembled in vitro as described (Gibson et al., 2009). Proper assembly was verified by restriction digest and DNA sequencing and resulted in pSM37 (encoding Num1 CC(95-303) LL/EE -PCN-S-TEV-ZZ). To generate a plasmid with which to N-terminally tag Dyn1 with a PH domain, the PH domain of Num1 (amino acids 2,563-2,692) was amplified using a forward primer flanked with an XmaI site and a reverse primer flanked with a SalI site. The PCR product was digested with XmaI and SalI and ligated into pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1 (Longtine et al., 1998) digested similarly, yielding pFA6a-kanMX6-PGAL1-PH.",
