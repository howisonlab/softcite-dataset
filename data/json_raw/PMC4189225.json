Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, defined as the proportion of total variation observed between the trials attributable to differences between trials rather than sampling error (chance), with values <25% considered as low and >75% as high. 16 The pooled effect for each grouping of trials was derived from the point estimate for each separate trial weighted by the inverse of the variance (1/SE 2 ). Continuous variable outcomes (PRU, per cent platelet inhibition) between the groups were compared with both a fixed effect model using the inverse variance method and a random effects model using the DerSimonian and Laird method. For cardiovascular outcomes, rates were expressed per patient-years to adjust for the varying duration of follow-up. Results were therefore reported as incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% CIs with the use of both a fixed effect model using the method of Mantel and Haenszel and a random effects model using the method of DerSimonian and Laird, with the estimate of heterogeneity being taken from the Mantel-Haenszel model. Publication bias was estimated using the weighted regression tests of Begg and Egger. 12 For platelet reactivity indices, analyses were stratified based on whether standard-dose (75 mg) or high-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel was used in the DAPT arm. In addition, further sensitivity analyses were performed based on the cohort enrolled: (1) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus not; and (2) enrolment of patients with HTPR at baseline versus not. For cardiovascular outcomes, analyses were stratified based on stent typedrug eluting stent (DES) versus Bare metal stent (BMS). A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.",

In the overall cohort, TAPT was associated with a 43% reduction in the risk of TLR (IRR=0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.73) ( figure 3D) and a 31% reduction in the risk of TVR (IRR=0.69; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.81) ( figure 3E) compared with DAPT. TAPT efficacy for reducing TLR and TVR was present even when the analyses were restricted to studies using DES. In DES-treated patients, TAPT resulted in a 43% reduction in TLR (IRR=0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74) and a 35% reduction in TVR (IRR=0.65; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.79) with TAPT compared with DAPT.",

            "text": "In patients undergoing PCI, TAPT using cilostazol results in significant decrease in platelet reactivity and reduced risk of HTPR. TAPT resulted in significantly lower mean PRU, greater platelet inhibition and reduced risk of HTPR in the setting of DAPT with both standard-dose and high-dose clopidogrel. In addition, TAPT was associated with a significant reduction in CV events, including reduction in MACE, driven largely by significant reductions in TLR and TVR. Most importantly, there was a significant lower stent thrombosis with TAPT versus DAPT. Moreover, the reduction of restenosis with TAPT remained even when the analysis was restricted to trials using DES. In addition, there was numerically higher bleeding with TAPT versus DAPT, although this did not reach statistical significant.

            "text": "Prior studies have shown a relationship between on-treatment platelet reactivity and adverse CV events in patients undergoing PCI. In an analysis of individual patient data from six studies with 3059 patients, for every 10 U increase in PRU there was a 4% increase in primary endpoint rate of death, MI or stent thrombosis (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.06; p<0.0001). 17 A recent consensus statement recommended a cut-off of PRU >235 U as the threshold for identifying patients with HTPR who may be at high risk for ischaemic or thrombotic events following PCI. 13 Patients with HTPR have been shown to have an increased risk of death (110% increase), MI (104% increase) and stent thrombosis (211% increase). 17 18 Although platelet reactivity is a surrogate marker, given the wide interindividual variability in clopidogrelinduced platelet inhibition, [1][2][3] various strategies have been tested to improve platelet inhibition. These strategies have utilised higher loading and maintenance doses of clopidogrel, or next-generation P2Y12 inhibitors such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, which are more potent that clopidogrel and have a more uniform antiplatelet effect. Doubling of the clopidogrel dose (150 mg) has been shown to significantly reduce PRU in patients with HTPR. [19][20][21] Similarly, data from the next-generation P2Y12 inhibitors such as prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown improved platelet reactivity indices when compared with clopidogrel. 22 Although the newer agents prasugrel and ticagrelor reduce MACE in randomised trials, these agents increase bleeding in patients with PCI and cost significantly more than generic clopidogrel. 23 24 Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, exhibits antiplatelet effects by increasing cAMP within platelets, and is available as a generic drug. Our results show a significant benefit of TAPT with cilostazol in improving platelet reactivity indices in patients undergoing PCI, with lower PRU, greater platelet inhibition and a significant reduction in the risk of HTPR regardless of comparison with either standard-dose or high-dose clopidogrel. In addition, these results were seen even in comparison with DAPT using high-dose clopidogrel. Given that generic clopidogrel is now available, many clinicians opt to prescribe high-dose clopidogrel to address HTPR in patients who cannot afford newer antiplatelet agents. The results of the present study show that TAPT with cilostazol is superior even to DAPT with high-dose clopidogrel. Despite these promising results, a number of limitations must be acknowledged. Although platelet reactivity is a risk factor/surrogate marker for adverse CV events, clinical studies have not yet demonstrated that a pharmacological treatment strategy based on platelet reactivity improves outcomes. 20 25 In the ARCTIC trial of 2440 patients randomised to platelet-function monitoring and drug adjustment group versus conventional strategy of no monitoring and drug adjustment, there were no differences in composite of death, MI, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularisation at 1 year between the two groups, calling into question the utility of adjusting therapies based on platelet function monitoring. 25 However, because cilostazol inhibits both platelet activation and smooth muscle proliferation, it has the potential to target two dreaded complications of PCI-stent thrombosis and restenosis. TAPT may reduce MACE by two or more cellular mechanisms. [8][9][10][11] Our study shows  Therefore, a strategy of using TAPT with cilostazol has several advantages: (1) it improves the surrogate outcome of platelet reactivity relative to DAPT, including high-dose clopidogrel; (2) the antismooth muscle proliferative properties of cilostazol may make it an excellent agent to prevent restenosis resulting in reduced TVR even in patients treated with a DES; (3) the improvement in platelet reactivity indices translate into significant reduction in stent thrombosis and (4) the medication is available generically and is therefore less expensive than newer antiplatelet therapy. Thus, when used following PCI, TAPT with cilostazol has the potential to be a cost-effective therapy to improve clinical outcomes by reducing thrombotic events and restenosis. The results of this study Figure 3 Continued therefore call for a randomised trial comparing a strategy of TAPT with DAPT using newer antiplatelet agents.",
