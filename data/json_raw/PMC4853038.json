            "text": "The placental syncytiotrophoblast, which is formed by the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells, is indispensable for the establishment and maintenance of normal pregnancy. The human endogenous retrovirus envelope glycoprotein syncytin-2 is the most important player in mediating trophoblast cell-cell fusion as a fusogen. We constructed expression plasmids of wild-type and 21 single-amino-acid substitution mutants of syncytin-2, including 10 N-glycosylation sites individually silenced by mutagenizing N to Q, 1 naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) N118S that introduced an N-glycosylation site, and another 10 non-synonymous SNPs located within important functional domains. We observed that syncytin-2 was highly fusogenic and that the mutants had different capacities in merging 293T cells. Of the 21 mutants, N133Q, N312Q, N443Q, C46R (in the CXXC motif) and R417H (in the heptad repeat region and immunosuppressive domain) lost their fusogenicity, whereas N332Q, N118S, T367M (in the fusion peptide), V483I (in the transmembrane domain) and T522M (in the cytoplasmic domain) enhanced the fusogenic activity. We also proved that N133, N146, N177, N220, N241, N247, N312, N332 and N443 were all glycosylated in 293T cells. A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed compromised interaction between mutants N443Q, C46R, T367M, R417H and the receptor MFSD2A, whereas N118S was associated with more receptors. We also sequenced the coding sequence of syncytin-2 in 125 severe pre-eclamptic patients and 272 normal pregnant Chinese women. Surprisingly, only 1 nonsynonymous SNP T522M was found and the frequencies of heterozygous carriers were not significantly different. Taken together, our results suggest that N-glycans at residues 133, 312, 332 and 443 of syncytin-2 are required for optimal fusion induction, and that SNPs C46R, N118S, T367M, R417H, V483I and T522M can alter the fusogenic function of syncytin-2."

            "text": "The human placenta is a transient organ of embryonic origin whose main function involves the exchange of metabolic and gaseous products between the fetal and maternal circulation. It also acts as an important endocrine secretion organ for normal pregnancy and a barrier between the fetus and its mother for immune tolerance, ensuring the preservation of the fetus. The major constituent of human placental tissue is the trophoblast, which stems from the trophectoderm of the blastocyst and develops before any embryonic tissue arises. Villous cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs) have 2 distinct ways of differentiation: to form highly invasive extravillous trophoblast cells or to fuse and form a multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast (STB) layer, a process designated syncytialization. The STB comes into direct contact with maternal blood, secreting important hormones to maintain pregnancy and mediating gas, nutrient and waste exchange. Inadequate syncytialization is correlated with severe pregnancy disorders such as pre-eclampsia (PE), which is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality. 1 Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying syncytialization in the placenta came from the identification of the human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) envelope proteins, syncytins, which are fusogens specifically expressed in the placenta. [2][3][4][5][6] HERVs are remnants of infections of former exogenous retroviruses, occupying at least 8% of the human genome at various stages of \"fossilization.\" 7 The 2 bona fide envelope glycoproteins, syncytin-1 and syncytin-2, are encoded by HERV-W (the official name is ERVW-1) and HERV-FRD (official name ERVFRD-1), and the retroviruses carrying them entered the primate lineage 25 and 40 million years ago, respectively. 4,8,9 Indeed, these 2 HERV envelope genes have undergone purifying selection during primate evolution to play important functions in placental physiology. 10,11 The existence of 2 murine endogenous retroviral envelope genes (syncytin-A and -B), homologous but not orthologous to the human syncytin genes and also critical for trophoblast cell fusion, have been reported. 12 The syncytin-A-deficient mouse placenta shows specific disruption of the architecture of the syncytiotrophoblast layer I (ST-I). 13 The syncytin-B null placenta exhibits impaired formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer II (ST-II). 14 Furthermore, syncytin genes with fusogenic activity and placenta-specific expression have been identified successively in the leporidae, carnivora, ruminant, tenrecidae, rodentia squirrelrelated clade and marsupial opossum, namely syncytin-Ory1, 15 syncytin-Car1, 16 syncytin-Rum1, 17 syncytin-Ten1, 18 syncytin-Mar1 19 and syncytin-Opo1, 20 respectively. This indicates that different syncytins have been acquired by different genomes and facilitate trophoblast cell-cell fusion in various animals.",

            "text": "Syncytin-1 has been visualized in almost all types of trophoblastic cells, including villous and extravillous trophoblast. 3,5,6,[21][22][23][24] Syncytin-1-induced cell-cell fusion is dependent on both ASCT1 and ASCT2 (alanine/serine/ cysteine/threonine transporter type 1 and 2), also called SLC1A4 and SLC1A5, respectively, which are Na Cdependent transporters for polar neutral amino acids and a common cell surface receptor for retroviruses. 6,[25][26][27] Systematic ASC activity is present in basal but not in apical membranes of the STB, 28,29 and ASCT2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed in most human placental tissues, including the CTBs and STB. 28,[30][31][32] By contrast, the expression of syncytin-2 is restricted to some of the CTBs throughout pregnancy, and more often at the interface between the CTBs and STB. 33 The receptor for syncytin-2, major facilitator superfamily domain containing 2A (MFSD2A), is a carbohydrate transporter with 10-12 transmembrane domains and is specifically expressed in the STB layer. 34 The highly specific localization of syncytin-2 and its receptor MFSD2A might argue for a major role of syncytin-2 in synergy with syncytin-1 during the fusion of the mononucleated CTBs into the multinucleated STB in vivo, therefore favoring the growth and renewal of the STB and precluding the fusion of CTBs between themselves. 9 The 1,617 bp sequence of the syncytin-2 envelope (env) gene mapped at 6p24.1 is within the HERV-FRD locus and encodes a~73 kDa glycosylated precursor protein. 4,33,35,36 Similar to a retroviral envelope protein, syncytin-2 is formed as a homotrimer connected by an intersubunit disulfide bond after posttranslational cleavage into the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits by proteolytic furin, with the SU interacting with its receptor on the cell surface and the TM carrying the fusion activity and serving to mediate membrane fusion. 36,37 The proper association of SU and TM subunits is necessary for the functional integrity of syncytin-1 and -2 because the chimeras of syncytin-1 and -2 swapping their subunits lose their fusogenicities. 36 As shown in Fig. 1A, the syncytin-2 precursor polypeptide contains the following important regions: (a) a signal peptide (SP) in the amino-terminal end (1-15 aa); (b) a disulfide bond isomerase motif (43-46 aa), Cys-X-X-Cys (CXXC); (c) a furin cleavage site (347-350 aa), RVRR, which separates the surface (SU) (16-350 aa) and transmembrane (TM) subunits (351-538 aa); (d) a conserved hydrophobic domain as a putative fusion peptide (FP) (354-374 aa) mediating the fusion of cell membranes; (e) a highly conserved putative immunosuppressive domain (ISD) (414-430 aa); (f) a CX6CC motif (431-439 aa), in which the first 2 cysteines can form an intersubunit disulfide bond and the third cysteine can form a intrasubunit disulfide bridge with the CXXC motif; (g) 2 heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) (384-422 aa and 447-456 aa); (h) a transmembrane domain (TMD) (479-499 aa); and (i) a 39-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain (CTM) (500-538 aa). 36,[38][39][40] Functional domain integrality and proper maturation conformation are required for the fusogenic activity of syncytin-2.",

Besides syncytins, only one another unrelated family of fusogens has been discovered, the F proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans. 41 To date, critical functional characterization of single-amino-acid mutations of syncytins and their relevance to diseases are still lacking. In the present study, we investigated whether disruption of potential N-glycosylation sites and naturally occurring non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp) in functional domains affected the fusogenicity of syncytin-2, and whether naturally occurring SNPs that affected the fusogenic function of syncytin-2 were associated with pregnancy-related complications such as PE. We approached these issues by generating 21 sitespecific mutants, including 10 potential N-glycosylation site mutants and 11 naturally occurring SNPs, and assessed their fusogenic activities in 293T and HeLa cells, which do not express syncytin-2 and serve as models for the cell-cell fusion assay. To define the receptor and other molecules interacting with syncytin-2, co-immunoprecipitation and protein mass spectrum analysis were utilized. Our results indicate that N-glycan and naturally occurring individual Figure 1.

In total, there are 10 potential N-glycosylation sites, with the first 8 located in the SU and the last 2 located in the TM (Fig. 1A, numbered as 1-10). We also searched the SNP database and found that 162 naturally occurring non-synonymous SNPs in the open reading frame (ORF) of syncytin-2 had been recorded. We selected 10 sites that were located within important functional domains or motifs. Of these, N118S probably introduced a new N-glycosylation site, C46R was located in the CXXC domain, A359T and T367M were located in the FP, R417H was located in the HR1 and ISD domains, L432V was located in the CX6CC motif, V483I was located in the TMD, and L503F, I518V, T522M and S536L were located in the CTM (Fig. 1A, numbered as [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. To characterize the effects of these N-glycosylation sites and non-synonymous SNPs on the fusogenic function of syncytin-2, we established a fusion assay using 293T-EmGFP and HeLa-EmGFP cell lines that stably overexpress green fluorescent protein (Fig. 1B) to monitor cell-cell fusion. The syncytin-2 receptor, MFSD2A, is expressed in 293T cells. 4 Therefore, syncytin-2-mediated cell-cell fusion could be observed 24 h after transfection with a syncytin-2 expression plasmid. As fusion proceeded, patches of green fluorescence were seen as the formation of multinucleated syncytia (Fig. 1C). Moreover, as HeLa cells do not express MFSD2A, 34 syncytin-2 mediated cell-cell fusion only occurred when co-transfecting syncytin-2 and MFSD2A overexpression plasmids, but not either plasmid alone (Fig. 1C).",

Meanwhile, the naturally occurring N118S, which probably introduces an N-glycosylation site, was also investigated. Of these mutants, N146Q, N177Q, N220Q, N241Q and N247Q in the SU subunit maintained their original fusion efficiency compared to wildtype (WT) syncytin-2, whereas N133Q, N312Q and N443Q lost their fusogenicity and N118S and N332Q acquired enhanced fusogenic activity (Fig. S1). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 2, when the cell samples were subjected to Western blot analysis, all N to Q substitutions except for N523Q revealed bands with lower molecular weight (arrowhead) than WT syncytin-2, indicating that N-glycosylation of syncytin-2 was widely distributed at these sites. Moreover, the naturally occurring N118S caused a higher molecular weight (arrow), indicating that the introduction of an extra N-glycosylation site occurred. Furthermore, the expression levels of the WT and mutant syncytins were consistent, showing that the transfection efficiency of the different plasmids and the exogenous expression of syncytin-2 were at a same level. Although the N118S immunostaining was reduced, it still significantly elevated the fusion efficiency. As a control, when all the N-glycans were removed by treatment with PNGase F N-glycanase, only a \u00bb55 kDa band was seen, whereas the precursor of syncytin-2 protein appeared to be \u00bb73 kDa, in accordance with previous results. 33,35,36 We also investigated the effects of the 10 selected nonsynonymous SNPs located within important functional domains/motifs on the fusogenic function of syncytin-2. Of these, A359T, L432V, L503F, I518V and S536L had no impact on the fusion efficiency mediated by syncytin-2 ( Fig. S1). Notably, C46R and R417H inhibited normal cell-cell fusion, whereas T367M, V483I and T522M enhanced fusogenic activity compared with the WT (Fig. S1). Again, the expression levels of these mutants were consistent with that of WT ( Fig. S2).",

N118 and N133 are close to each other and within the N-terminal half of the SU subunit. Gaining an extra N-glycosylation site at N118 and removal of the N-glycan at N133 stimulated and inhibited the fusion efficiency, respectively. However, although both N312 and N332 are located in the Cterminal region of the SU subunit, disruption of both sites individually caused contradictory effects. Furthermore, C46R within the CXXC motif, T367M within the FP, R417H within the HR1 and ISD, V483I within the TMD and T522M within the CTM all caused significantly altered fusogenic activity, indicating that these functional domains were sensitive to single-amino-acid substitution and that these sites were required for optimal fusion induction (Fig. 3A). Importantly, Western blot ( Fig. 3B) and quantitative real-time PCR ( Fig. 3C) analysis were used to ensure that all the WT and mutant syncytins were expressed at similar levels both at the mRNA and protein levels. Again, N118S stimulated the fusogenic activity of syncytin-2, despite the reduced immune-reactivity ( Fig. 3B). Because its mRNA was expressed normally, one explanation for this could be the loss of an epitope due to the amino acid substitution.",

No immunoreactive bands were detected in control mock-transfected cells and pEF6-MFSD2A-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was then used for the co-immunoprecipitation of syncytin-2 in HeLa cells.

Moreover, the naturally occurring N118S introduced an extra N-glycosylation site and produced a protein with a higher molecular weight. Of these 10 glycosylated sites, the first 9 were all located within the SU subunit. Interestingly, only the mutations of the first 2 and the last 2 sites (N118S, N133Q, N312Q and N332Q), but not of the middle 5 sites (N146Q, N177Q, N220Q, N241Q and N247Q) altered the fusogenicity of syncytin-2. The binding of the SU to the receptor is the prerequisite for the FP at the N-terminus of the TM to drive membrane fusion. 37,40 Therefore, our results indicate that the N-glycans located at the N-terminal half and Cterminal arm of the SU subunit are important for syncytin-2-mediated cell-cell fusion probably by affecting the interaction between the SU and the receptor. The nonfunctional sites from N146 to N247 indicate that this region is flexible in conformation and tolerates losing the glycosylation. In the case of syncytin-1, the N-terminal 124 amino acids of the SU are the minimal receptor- binding domain containing a conserved 18-residue motif essential for syncytin-1-ASCT2 interaction. 48 Moreover, N443Q, which is in proximity to the CX6CC motif and HR2 domain in the central region of the ectodomain TM, also significantly suppressed the fusogenic property of the native syncytin-2 protein. As reported, the 2 heptad repeat regions HR1 and HR2 specifically form intramolecular interaction between each other and are necessary for syncytin-mediated cell-cell fusion. 38 Our results add new evidence that the N443Q might destabilize the hairpin conformation of HR1 and HR2, or hinder the formation of the disulfide bond, and discourage cell-cell fusion. Taken together, our results indicate that syncytin-2 has 9 N-linked glycosylation sites, among which glycans at residues 133, 312, 443 and 332 are required for optimal fusion induction, and that appropriate sugar chain density over the specific region is preserved for functional integrity.",

This agrees well with the effect of C46A from a previous extensive study, which shows mutations in the CXXC motif not only inhibit fusion but also can function as dominant-negative mutants. 36 However, the naturally occurring SNP L432V located in the CX6CC motif in the TM subunit did not alter the fusion efficiency, indicating the flexibility of the 6 amino acids between the 3 cysteines.

This suggests that the conformation of the hydrophobic transmembrane region might be sensitive to single-amino-acid substitution, although both valine and isoleucine are nonpolar amino acids. The CTM of syncytin-1 and syncytin-2 is essential for their fusogenic activities. The comparison of human ERVW-1 elements and the orthologous loci in simians reveals an syncytin-1-specific signature in the intracytoplasmic tail is crucial for the envelope fusogenic activity. 10 A systematic study involves a series of C-terminal truncated mutants of syncytin-1 shows that cytoplasmic sequences immediately adjacent to the transmembrane region are necessary for inducing optimal cell-cell fusion, whereas the extreme C-terminus partially inhibits its fusogenic function. 39 Similarly, different C-terminally truncated syncytin-2 mutants led to a decrease in the size and number of syncytia at different levels. 36 Of the 4 SNPs (L503F, I518V, T522M and S536L) in the CTM tested, only T522M changed the fusogenic activity compared with the WT. This is also consistent with previous findings that some regions in the CTM of syncytin-1 are flexible in the conformation. 38 Altogether, we have characterized 5 SNPs (C46R, T367M, R417H, V483I and T522M) in conserved domains as strong candidates that can alter the fusogenic function of syncytin-2.",

We found that the C46R and R417H mutants almost completely blocked syncytin-2-mediated cell-cell fusion, and N133Q, N312Q and N443Q mutants significantly suppressed the fusogenic properties of the native syncytin-2 protein. The molecular mechanism of inhibition is unclear, but it is likely that the mutants with single-amino-acid substitutions in important functional domains can efficiently compete with native syncytin-2 to bind the receptor or to trigger signaling pathways for merging membranes. We therefore employed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to study the sensitivity and specificity of the interaction between syncytin-2 and its receptor MFSD2A. Of the 5 defective mutants, N133Q and N312Q could be pulled down normally by MFSD2A, whereas N443Q, C46R and R417H showed compromised interaction with the receptor. The results with R417H and N443Q are quite unexpected because they are located within the TM subunit. This finding probably provides insight into the significance of the TM subunit serving as an indispensable component of the SU-TM homotrimer during the interaction between the SU and the receptor. Notably, the significantly induced fusion with the N118S mutant correlated well with its higher ability to bind with the receptor. However, whether the T367M mutant that showed reduced interaction with the receptor while promoting fusion is related to the activation of other signaling pathways remains to be studied."
