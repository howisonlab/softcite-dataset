            "text": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has been used to identify the characteristics of cancer cells and to evaluate the response of cancer cells to the targeted treatment, noninvasively, by MR signal (1). The commonly utilized elements for MRS are 1 H, 31 P, 13 C, 19 F, 23 NA and 2 H (2). The phosphorous metabolites detected by 31 P MRS, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesters (PME), and phosophodiesters (PDE), provide the information of the intracellular pH, the cellular energy metabolism, and the phospholipid metabolism (3,4).",

Moreover, even though 31 P MRS showed good reproducibility among different institutions (9), many of the results did not match well with other results. The most useful metabolite ratios have not yet been agreed on. Furthermore, long scan time and the complexity of the post-processing procedure make other limitations to apply 31 P MRS to patients.",

The chemical shift in the 31 P MRS referred to the position of PCr (\u03b4 = 0.00 ppm). The intracelluar pH of the lesions was calculated by using the chemical shift of Pi relative to PCr, with the formula taken from Ng et al. (10)  (Fig. 2). The integral of each of the phosphorous metabolites, such as ATP, PCr, Pi, PME and PDE, was measured. The following metabolite ratios of PME/PDE, PME/Pi, PDE/Pi, PME/ATP, PDE/ATP, PME/PCr, PDE/PCr, PCr/ATP, PCr/Pi and ATP/Pi were calculated from the measured values (Figs. 3-5).",

Contrary to the assumption that tumor cells have acidic metabolism, measurements of human and animal tumor pH using 31 P MRS reported neutral-to-alkaline values (16). As reported in various studies, the pH of brain tumors was significantly higher than that of the normal brain tissue (17,18).  In our study, the brain tumor had a tendency of alkalization. The pH of astrocytoma was slightly higher than that of the normal brain. In lymphoma, the pH was significantly higher than that in the normal brain.

The difficulty of appropriate calibration, the sensitivity of the surface coils, J-coupling, low concentration of metabolites and variations from other various correction factors also contribute to the variations of quantification of phosphorus metabolites.

            "text": "In the present study, the MRS signal was obtained by using the FID 2D CSI sequence, collecting FID signal using the CSI sequence. In a classical CSI sequences, the MRS obtains the signal by applying the phase-encoding gradients without a frequency-encoding gradient. Thus, the FID CSI sequence collects a FID, either from the entire sensitive volume of the receiver coil or a prescribed set of slices (28,29). As a result, the MRS signals using the FID CSI sequences can be contaminated from normal parenchyma in the outside of the lesion. The MRS signal differences between the tumor and normal tissue can be reduced. For more conservative approach, we performed 31 P MRS on the relatively large sized brain tumor. 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study to the patients with a low field strength equipment like a 1.5 T scanner usually require a long scan time and large voxel, due to low SNR caused by a low concentration of phosphorous metabolite in the lesion (3,8). Recently, MRS apparatus has rapidly evolved to perform the study of a relatively small volume of voxel and in a reasonable scan time. We adapted a 27 mL voxel volume and a 6 minutes 36 seconds scan time, with a total scan time of 15 minutes, including the scanning for localization. We designed this study to obtain the MRS signal in vivo as soon as possible and to evaluate the clinical feasibility of 31 P MRS study. This scan time was tolerable for patients to obtain the MR imaging and the MR spectrum in a study. 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of human brain lesions has shown substantial variability. This variability reported in the literature seemed to have numerous causes. In another previous study (3), masses with a large portion of necrosis were excluded. They suspected that the amount of the necrosis or cystic portion in the brain tumor could create variability of the peak intensities of phosphorous metabolites in the same tumor group. Moreover, the peripheral located voxel and hemorrhage in a lesion may produce magnetic susceptibility artifact that causes a nondiagnostic spectrum or distortion of spectrum. In order to Korean J Radiol 14(3), May/Jun 2013 kjronline.org avoid the possibility of spectrum diversity by these causes, we excluded the brain lesions that have a large cyst, a large necrotic portion, hemorrhage, and were small peripheral located brain lesions, according to the routine brain MRI.",
