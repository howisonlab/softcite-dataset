Standard surgical treatment is being superseded by new catheter-based treatments, many of which are as yet unproven. The need for appropriate instruments to measure quality of life in patients receiving treatment for HVD has therefore never been greater. Methods: In this prospective observational study, a generic instrument, Euroqol, and a disease-specific one (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire-MLHFQ) were, for the first time, formally tested before and after surgery in 84 patients with HVD who completed their treatment. Patients were interviewed on the night before surgery and 6-12 weeks after being discharged. Instruments were tested for validity, reliability, responsiveness, sensitivity and interpretability. Results: Both Euroqol and MLHFQ registered significant improvements in patients' health. Tests for validity were significantly positive for both Euroqol and MLHFQ. Tests for reliability and responsiveness were very positive for MLHFQ, less so for EQ-5D. There was a moderate ceiling effect in the postoperative Index scores of Euroqol and a moderate floor effect in MLHFQ. Conclusions: Both instruments together performed very well in assessing the health of patients undergoing surgical treatment of HVD. As the incidence of HVD increases and therapeutic options increase, measurement of PROMS using these two instruments should become a matter of routine.",

The mainstay of treatment for these patients is open heart surgery-specifically heart valve replacement or repair. Although effective, open heart surgery is associated with significant morbidity, which may limit its usefulness in the elderly patient. [1][2][3] In recent years, a number of percutaneous catheter-based treatments have become available. As patients get older and associated morbidities increase, demand for these new costly treatments will also undoubtedly increase. The efficacy of many of these treatments, however, remains unproven. 4 The main objectives of any treatment of heart valve disease are to improve quality of life and survival.

This measures correlation between items that measures similar quality of life domains.

They are used as an assessment of efficacy of treatments as well as an outcome measure to assess performance of institutions who deliver the treatment. 5 6 Formal assessment of PROMS in patients undergoing major joint replacement, varicose vein surgery and hernia repair is now routine for all patients being treated for these conditions in the UK National Health Service. 5 6 A pilot study has examined the use of PROMS undergoing percutaneous and surgical revascularisation of significant coronary artery disease. 28 Owing to an ageing population, the incidence of significant heart valve disease is increasing. Ten per cent of all humans aged 80 or older will have significant aortic stenosis, the most common valve dysfunction in the developed world. 29 Asymptomatic patients can live a long time with significant heart valve dysfunction. Once symptoms set in, however, patients quickly become disabled with symptoms of breathlessness, chest pain and fluid retention, and their prognosis rapidly worsens if the valve disease is left untreated. 30 Until fairly recently, the mainstay of treatment has been open heart surgery. Although effective, and despite the recent increase in 'minimally-invasive' techniques, surgery remains a treatment associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This becomes more prominent in older patients. In addition, many patients do not seem to get the presumed benefit from undergoing major heart surgery. 29 30 Over the past 5 years, there has been a rapid increase in the uptake of non-surgical catheter-based solutions, most common of which is the transcutaneous aortic implantation (TAVI) (TAVR replacement in the USA) procedure. A number of devices for the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation (the second most common valve dysfunction in the developed world) are just over the horizon. These devices are very expensive and many are of unproven worth. In a world of cash-strapped healthcare systems, evidence-based means of assessing the effect of disease and its treatment are urgently required.",
