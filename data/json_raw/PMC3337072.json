            "text": "Early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious and prevalent psychiatric illness in adolescents and young adults. Current treatments are not optimally effective. Biological markers of early-onset MDD could increase diagnostic specificity, but no such biomarker exists. Our innovative approach to biomarker discovery for early-onset MDD combined results from genomewide transcriptomic profiles in the blood of two animal models of depression, representing the genetic and the environmental, stress-related, etiology of MDD. We carried out unbiased analyses of this combined set of 26 candidate blood transcriptomic markers in a sample of 15-19-year-old subjects with MDD (N \u00bc 14) and subjects with no disorder (ND, N \u00bc 14). A panel of 11 blood markers differentiated participants with early-onset MDD from the ND group. Additionally, a separate but partially overlapping panel of 18 transcripts distinguished subjects with MDD with or without comorbid anxiety. Four transcripts, discovered from the chronic stress animal model, correlated with maltreatment scores in youths. These pilot data suggest that our approach can lead to clinically valid diagnostic panels of blood transcripts for early-onset MDD, which could reduce diagnostic heterogeneity in this population and has the potential to advance individualized treatment strategies."

            "text": "Early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious psychiatric condition occurring in people under 25 years of age. 1 Early onset of MDD predicts greater familial risk, suggesting a substantial genetic etiology. 2,3 Approximately 1% of the population of o12 years has MDD, but rates increase to 17-25% by late adolescence and young adulthood. 4,5 Early-onset MDD carries a poorer prognosis than adult onset, characterized by derailment of normal development and, subsequently, increases in the prevalence of substance use, physical illness, social maladjustment and suicidality. [6][7][8][9][10][11] This dysfunction persists into adulthood with continued mood disturbance, and often presents comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders. 9,12 Treatments for early-onset MDD exist, but medication side effects are unpredictable and adolescents have lower response rates than adults. 13,14 Unmeasured heterogeneity in the etiology of MDD and the presence of symptom cluster subtypes that require unique treatments may explain these problems. 15,16 Current diagnostic practice is limited to patient self-report and clinician observation, methods that cannot adequately characterize this heterogeneity. Biological markers of different etiologic pathways and/or endophenotypes would provide objective data to augment verbal information and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The diagnosis and classification of early-onset MDD could lead to a larger repertoire of more effective treatments and enhanced individualized care.",

The first approach screens candidate markers suggested by current knowledge of MDD etiology, such as serum levels of cortisol 18 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. 19 The other approach takes an exploratory route through the use of omic technologies such as the proteomic profiling for bipolar disorder 20 and transcriptomic profiling for psychosis 21 or for mood disorders. 22 Each approach has its advantages and challenges, but neither has been successful in identifying biomarkers that survive the tests of replication and selectivity. 23 In the present paper, we describe a promising novel approach to discover blood biomarkers, and a pilot study focusing on their validity for distinguishing early-onset MDD from no disorder in youth.",

Furthermore, the WMI rats show depressive-like behavior during early adolescence. 32 The chronic stress model employed young adult males of four phylogenetically, physiologically and behaviorally different strains of rats as described previously, and half of the animals from each strain were exposed to chronic restraint stress and the other half were not. 24 Genetic polymorphisms between the strains ranged from 25.9 to 66%, representing a substantial interstrain variation that aims at mimicking individual variation among human subjects.",

We elected to monitor transcript levels, rather than serum protein levels, as a more all-encompassing approach, as not all proteins are secreted and not all transcripts are translated. Moreover, current technology allows the collection of blood for RNA isolation without refrigeration, an additional practical advantage."

The core hypothesis for this study was that the combined list of transcripts that differentiated depressed-like from non-depressed-like rats would also differentiate human subjects with early-onset MDD from those without any disorder. We also explored whether a subset of these transcripts differentiated youths solely with MDD from those with comorbid anxiety, which is one of the bestdescribed endophenotypes."

Whole blood was also collected into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechticon, Switzerland) from three males, derived from different litters, of each strain. Briefly, total RNA isolated from these four tissue sources was reverse-transcribed with an Oligo(dT)-T7 primer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the GeneChip Expression 3 0 -Amplification One-cycle kit (Affymetrix). In an in vitro transcription reaction with T7 RNA polymerase, the cDNA was linearly amplified and labeled with biotinylated nucleotides (Affymetrix). A total of 10 mg of biotin-labeled and fragmented cRNA was then hybridized onto Rat Genome 230 2.0 GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix) for 16 h at 45 1C. Post-hybridization staining and washing were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols using the Fluidics Station 450 instrument (Affymetrix).

Our approach is also innovative in combining theoretical and atheoretical strategies in animal models of depression to identify a panel of transcripts in the blood that did distinguish subjects with earlyonset MDD from those in the ND group. Moreover, a partly overlapping set of transcripts differentiated youths with MDDonly from those having MDD with comorbid Anxiety Disorders, providing the first panel of blood transcripts that might be useful for detecting these endophenotypes. Previous research to identify panels of blood biomarkers has focused on serum factors 46,47 or on blood expression biomarkers using the complex approach of Convergent Functional Genomics developed by Le-Niculescu et al. 22 The strategy recently being used to identify serum-based markers is to select them from biochemical domains previously associated with MDD. 47 This approach has the advantage of focusing on the biologically functional protein end points. The Convergent Functional Genomics approach combined brain and blood expression data from a pharmacogenomic animal model with human blood and post-mortem expression data and human genetic linkage/association data. This elegant assemblage of multiple levels of information has the advantage that the markers thus selected could yield information about genetic vulnerability and related transcriptomic changes.",

These models comprised the genetic and the environmental (chronic stress) components of MDD etiology, and thereby these candidate biomarkers for MDD highlight genetic vulnerability factors and their transcriptomic consequences, in addition to biological costs of a repeated stressor. The strengths of our approach include the uniqueness of the genetic animal model we employed, and the selection process of candidate markers. Namely, transcripts were selected as candidates when they showed significant same-directional differences in any of the brain regions examined and in the blood of the genetically 'depressed' WMI compared with their genetically very close control, the WLI. This allowed us to verify that the candidate transcripts were relevant to brain functions and, therefore, some of these transcripts can be regarded as prospective novel drug targets. Another strength is that our chronic stress blood markers were compiled from a study of four genetically diverse strains, thereby providing a rather narrow, but powerfully informative, set of transcripts. These transcripts represent generalizable responsiveness to stress and signify the notion that stress marks all organisms, regardless of their vulnerability or resilience."

            "text": "The first biomarker panel we define consists of 11 transcripts that differentiated youths with MDD from those without any disorder. These candidate markers are derived almost equally from the genetic and chronic stress models of depression. The genes expressing these transcripts belong to three broad functional categories: those involved in transcription, neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Genes with transcriptional regulatory functions include MAF, which encodes a DNA-binding, leucine zipper-containing transcription factor, and the cytoplasmic cerebellar degenerationrelated protein 2 antigen (CDR2), which harbors a helixleucine zipper motif and interacts specifically with c-Myc. 48 Genes that regulate, modify or interfere with neurodevelopment include RAPH1 (Ras association and pleckstrin homology domains 1, also known as LPD), which is intimately involved in proper neuronal migration. 49 Tyrosine phosphatase PTP4A3, also called PRL-3, has oncogenic activity, but has also been reported to promote cell migration. 50 CMAS encodes an enzyme, cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (also known as CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase), which regulates brain sialylation levels and, therefore, very likely affects brain development. 51 Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), also known as immunoglobulin superfamily, member 4 (IGSF4), is a synaptic adhesive molecule involved in neural cell adhesion processes and synaptogenesis. 52 CADM1 is thought to contribute to depressive-like behavior in a recent mouse genetic study, 53 and has also been linked with social impairments and anxiety-like behavior. 54,55 A group of candidate biomarkers have known functions in processes that mediate neuronal damage. PSME1 (proteasome activator subunit 1, also called PA28a) activates the proteosomal hydrolysis of intracellular proteins. Inadequate glucose supply causes damage of neuronal cells, and PSME1 is highly responsive to hypoglycemic environment in neurons. 56 CD59, also called MIRL or protectin, encodes a singlechain, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein structurally homologous to snake venom neurotoxins. 57 The protein has complement-inhibitory properties, but its capability to mediate complement-mediated damage to neurons is also recognized. [58][59][60][61] The CAT gene encodes catalase, a key antioxidant enzyme that serves as a defense against oxidative stress. Chronic unpredictable stress decreases CAT expression in the mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus; 62 these effects may be mirrored by the decreased expression of this gene in the blood of both the chronic stress model and subjects with MDD. The expression of AMFR (autocrine motility factor receptor), otherwise known as GP78, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase, is increased by accumulation of neurodegenerative disease proteins, such as mutant huntingtin, 63 SOD1 and ataxin-3. 64 This increase in AMFR expression may represent a protective response to enhance the removal of these disease proteins, and suggests that a decrease of AMFR/GP78 expression, as we found in MDD, might make the organism more vulnerable to these diseases.",

Moreover, it is possible that there are different etiologic factors involved in this endophenotype, for example, exposure to chronic stress particularly at the highly stressful period of adolescence. Most of these transcripts have no known function relevant to MDD or brain, including three of the four 'genetic depression model' markers: FAM46A (family with sequence similarity 46, member A), NAGA (N-acetylgalactosaminidase) and ZNF291/SCAPER (S-phase cyclin A-associated protein in the ER).

TLR7, or its agonists, induce inflammatory responses in the periphery and in the brain, 66 and greater expression of TLR7 are associated with poor functional outcome in ischemic stroke patients. 67 Polymorphism in GCLM (glutamate cysteine ligase modulatory subunit), the first rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione synthesis, has been associated with depression and schizophrenia, although this association has not been confirmed. 68 Nevertheless, glutathione deficits have been observed in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's diseases 69 as well as in schizophrenia. GGA3 (golgi-associated, gamma adaptin ear containing ARF binding protein 3) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 70 It is interesting to note that subjects with lower levels of GGA3 may be at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, 70 and that MDD is thought to be a triggering or precipitating factor in Alzheimer's disease. Several of the blood candidate markers whose expression differed between MDD and controls or between MDD subtypes are involved in different neurodegenerative processes, suggesting that MDD, and perhaps other psychiatric illnesses, can lead to neurodegeneration. These markers, therefore, could present a generic 'neurodegenerative fingerprint' in the brain and blood. Alternatively, as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative illnesses are known to show symptoms of depression before their regular presentation, depression might be a precipitating factor in these illnesses indicated by the presence of these biomarkers.",

The main goal of this pilot study was to determine if blood transcripts from both a genetic and a chronic stress animal model of depression could lead to candidate blood biomarkers for early-onset MDD in human subjects. The pilot data presented here suggest that our approach leads to a clinically valid diagnostic panel of blood transcripts that can differentiate early-onset MDD from controls and MDD with from MDD without anxiety. The next step is to test our findings in a large sample of youths with MDD, comparing them with youths without any psychiatric disorder and youths diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders. Eventually, the effect of treatment on validated biomarkers panels can be established, allowing for further individualization of MDD treatment strategies."
