Of the known salivary proteins, a paucity of information exists concerning the role of proteinase 3 (PR3), a serine protease of the chymotrypsin family, in dental caries. Whole, unstimulated saliva was collected from children with varying degrees of active caries and tested using a Human Protease Array Kit and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A significantly decreased concentration of salivary PR3 was noted with increasing severity of dental caries (P,0.01); a positive correlation (r50.87; P,0.01; Pearson's correlation analysis) was also observed between salivary pH and PR3 concentration. In an antibacterial test, a PR3 concentration of 250 ng?mL 21 or higher significantly inhibited Streptococcus mutans UA159 growth after 12 h of incubation (P,0.05). These studies indicate that PR3 is a salivary factor associated with the severity of dental caries, as suggested by the negative relationship between salivary PR3 concentration and the severity of caries as well as the susceptibility of S. mutans to PR3.",

            "text": "Dental caries is one of the most common human diseases, with a high prevalence of caries in early mixed dentition worldwide. Caries can progress rapidly if left untreated, resulting in pain and infection; thus, early diagnosis and prevention is of great importance. [1][2][3][4][5] Salivary analyses have been used to help assess the risk of caries by measuring the saliva's buffering capacity and bacterial content. 6 Recent studies have also indicated that a comprehensive compositional analysis of the complexity of oral fluid is very important in the assessment of the severity of caries. 1, [7][8] Whole saliva is predominantly composed of water (99.5%); it also contains proteins (0.3%) and inorganic, trace substances (0.2%). 9 The origin and function of some salivary proteins (e.g., a-amylase, carbonic anhydrase, cystatins, statherins, histatins and proline-rich proteins) and inorganic compounds have been studied, but those of salivary proteases have yet to be fully elucidated. 6,[9][10] The word 'protease' refers to any enzyme that catalyses proteolysis reactions. Different classes of proteases can perform the same reaction via completely different catalytic mechanisms. [11][12] In the oral cavity, proteases are derived from bacteria or are secreted by human glands. Proteases can also originate from the oropharyngeal mucosae and crevicular fluids. 7,9 Such enzymes play many varied but important roles in metabolic control, making any analysis of proteases in the oral cavity meaningful.",

[23][24] As a result, the development and implementation of oral health promotion strategies is highly recommended. 21,25 The protease array results suggested that the level of MMP-8 within saliva samples from subjects with caries was higher than that in subjects without caries. This finding is consistent with previous studies, which indicated that the presence of caries correlates strongly with salivary levels of MMP-8. 26 It has been reported that MMPs play an important role in dental caries pathogenesis because collagen degradation is thought to be initiated by MMPs. 14,27 However, the levels of salivary PR3 and other proteases in caries were noted to be lower in a caries-free environment, and an explanation for this observation has been lacking to date.",

            "text": "The known biological functions of PR3 include the following: degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components; 28 cleavage of inflammatory mediators; 29 platelet activation; 30 induction of endothelial cell apoptosis; 31 negative feedback regulation of granulopoiesis; 32 and the target of auto-antibodies in Wegener's granulomatosis. 33 Previous studies have not described any known relationship between PR3 and dental caries. As shown with ELISA, we found that children who were caries-resistant, whether they were male or female, demonstrated higher PR3 concentrations in their saliva; conversely, the more serious the caries, the lower the concentration of PR3. This suggests that PR3 may act as a protease factor in the severity of dental caries, with low levels leading to a greater severity of caries. Thus, analysis of PR3 levels may help to assess the severity of caries.",

            "text": "The pH of whole saliva was also measured in this study. Caries-free children produced saliva with a slightly higher pH level than children with severe dental caries. In support of this finding, a report by Kuriakose et al. 34 showed that the pH of saliva from children who suffered from rampant dental caries was significantly lower than that from children who were caries resistant. In our study, however, no significant overall difference was observed after comparing the three groups of differing severities of dental caries. This result suggests that using salivary pH on its own may not be useful for evaluating the severity of dental caries and that salivary pH should be considered in conjunction with dental plaque or other components in the oral cavity. [35][36] It has been reported that the optimal pH for PR3 activity is 8.0. 15,37 In our study, a significantly positive correlation was shown between PR3 concentration and pH, with higher pH leading to increased PR3 concentration. In the oral cavity, an alkaline environment may be more conducive to enzyme activity by PR3 or other proteases. 15 The bactericidal mechanism of PR3 was also studied. [38][39] Previous findings indicated that PR3 has an extracellular, microbicidal role in neutrophil extracellular traps. 39 PR3 can also process human cathelicidin (hCAP-18) to generate the potent, antibacterial 4.5 kDa peptide LL-37. 40 Some reports have even suggested that PR3 can defend against fungal infections. 41 However, the role of PR3 in cariology is presently unknown. Our data confirm that S. mutans, part of the oral flora associated with dental caries, are also susceptible to PR3. This susceptibility may be mediated by a bacteriostatic effect or an effect on bacterial growth. When the concentration of PR3 was increased to 250 ng?mL 21 or above, bacterial growth was significantly inhibited after 12 h of incubation. However, the PR3 concentration in the oral cavity is approximately 3-30 ng?mL 21 ; thus, further study is required to determine whether the PR3 concentration can reach 250 ng?mL 21 or above in the human oral cavity. Thus, additional studies are required to explore the physiological significance of the concentration of PR3 required to inhibit bacterial growth and to determine whether PR3 can be used as a preventive measure for dental caries in clinical trials.",
