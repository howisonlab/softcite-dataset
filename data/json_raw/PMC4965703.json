The qualitative data presented in this paper sheds new light on key components of successful chronic care management programs. By going beyond a task-and temporal-based framework, this analysis identifies and defines the importance of ''authentic healing relationships'' in driving individual and systemic change. Drawing on the voices of 30 former clients of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers, the investigators use qualitative methods to identify and elaborate the core elements of the authentic healing relationship-security, genuineness, and continuity-a relationship that is linked to patient motivation and active health management. Although not readily found in the traditional health care delivery system, these authentic healing relationships present significant implications for addressing the persistent health-related needs of patients with frequent hospitalizations.",

            "text": "F aced with accelerating health care costs in the United States, policy makers have grappled over the last several decades with the challenge of reducing spending while improving quality of care. 1 As frequent hospital utilization is considered to be a major contributor to health care spending, increased attention has been focused on the relatively small proportion of the population described as ''high risk'' and ''high cost'' (also known as ''super-utilizers,'' ''frequent flyers,'' and ''heavy users''). 2 Despite a vast body of literature on a critical question in health care policy and delivery, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the specific care needs of individuals with frequent hospitalizations and successful mechanisms to address these needs. 3,4 This paper is one in a series that utilizes data from interviews with former clients of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers (The Coalition) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of these frequent health care users and targeted care management programs. Using qualitative methods, this study draws on 30 patient interviews to identify and define the characteristics and roles of authentic relationships in care management, an emergent concept currently missing in the literature.",

[14][15][16][17] However, this is the first study, to the investigators' knowledge, to identify and detail the attributes and role of what is termed ''authentic healing relationships'' in the management of care for patients with frequent hospitalizations. Although a handful of studies have demonstrated that ''continuous healing relationships,'' or physician-patient continuity, 18 is associated with improved quality of care and decreased likelihood of future hospitalizations, [19][20][21] these studies focus on the element of continuity. The present analysis of ''authentic healing relationships'' encompasses not only continuity, but also the nontemporal components of security and genuineness. 22 The first section of this paper describes the qualitative study methods. The second section illustrates the complexity of the sample population, to contextualize the results. The third section identifies the characteristics and role of authentic healing relationships by drawing on interviewee descriptions of their care management. The fourth section explores the advantages and limitations of family and friend networks in fostering authentic healing relationships. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the findings and policy recommendations to bolster authentic healing relationships in the formal health care system and beyond.",

The care management teams, who provide care in the homes of patients, utilize an acceptance framework to customize the intervention and decision-making process. Team members are trained in harm reduction, motivational interviewing, and trauma-informed care. 24 The Coalition care delivery is informed by the understanding that past experiences, particularly those related to trauma, have lasting effects on patient well-being, including their day-to-day functioning and physical, social, and emotional health.",

The research team created a semi-structured interview guide based on the results of the first study 25 and input from staff members at the Coalition. Topics included employment and living situation, behavioral health risks, usual sources of care, adult protective factors, adverse childhood experiences, ability to recover from stress, perceived selfefficacy, and experiences with the Coalition. For questions requiring an affirmative, negative, or numerical response, prompts and probes extended the narratives. A small number of these prompts were revised after several initial interviews to address confusion. The data presented in this paper represent a subset of themes from the interview data set.",

The analysis team discussed and refined these themes as a group. Thematic saturation occurred after reviewing and discussing 20 interviews. The themes identified were used to generate and define inductive codes. The transcripts were then imported into the qualitative analysis software NVivo 10 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia), after which the 2 investigators independently coded the transcripts, with meetings to resolve discrepancies and reach consensus on preliminary and final codes.

First, there is a need to shift beyond the traditional biomedical paradigm to create authentic healing relationships in health care delivery. To scale this relationship throughout health care delivery, tools and techniques to identify, foster, assess, and sustain this relationship need to be thoughtfully developed so that it can be taught and replicated without jeopardizing the essence of the relationship. Training on creating authentic healing relationships should be integrated into health care professional training curricula and accreditation.",

Interprofessional care teams drawing on these best practices may have the best chance to cause desired shifts in self-management of disease, health care utilization, and outcomes.",

            "text": "Finally, care management programs should expand beyond a central focus on individual behavior change. 11 Existing authentic healing relationships with family and friends and long-term care networks must be supported and built into care management. Because care management programs tend to be transient, training family and friends in care management (as well as expanding care management services for people without social support systems) would allow for the continued benefits of authentic healing relationships. One mechanism to facilitate this is to design and expand services and support for family and friend caregivers, as well as direct-care workers (nurse aides, home health aides, and personal care aides). At this time, many ''informal caregivers'' lack educational, emotional, and financial support, which often translates into psychological and physical burnout. 30 Although policy makers have called for and implemented caregiver support programs for elderly persons and disabled children (The National Family Caregiver Support Act), 31,32 the present analysis demonstrates that many other individuals who fall between these 2 age groups also require substantial care and assistance in their homes. Longitudinal support for home-based services is needed for patients at risk of frequent hospitalizations, regardless of age.",

The data presented in this paper sheds new light on previous studies regarding the importance of a continuous healing relationship in decreasing hospitalizations and improving care and outcomes. Three core elements of authentic healing relationships were identified: security, genuineness, and continuity. Despite their power to improve health care delivery and motivate patient involvement in their own treatment, authentic healing relationships are not readily found in the traditional health care system. Future research should seek to better understand how authentic healing relationships can be taught, sustained, and supported. ",
