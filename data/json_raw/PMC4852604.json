In this study, we evaluate the risk factors of post-traumatic CSDH. Methods: Two-hundred and seventy-seven patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study from January 2012 to December 2013. Of those, 20 participants had minor head trauma developed CSDH afterward. We also included 257 patients with minor head trauma who did not develop CSDH during the same follow-up period as the control group. We investigated the risk factors related to the development of CSDH after minor head trauma. Results: Old age (p=0.014), preexisting diabetes mellitus (p=0.010), hypertension (p=0.026), history of cerebral infarction (p=0.035), antiplatelet agents (p=0.000), acute subdural hematoma in the convexity (p=0.000), encephalomalacia (p= 0.029), and long distance between skull and brain parenchyma (p=0.000) were significantly correlated with the development of CSDH after trauma. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the maximum distance between the skull and the cerebral parenchyma was the independent risk factor for the occurrence of CSDH (hazard ratio 2.55, p=0.000). Conclusion: We should consider the possibility of developing CSDH in the post-traumatic patients with the identified risk factors.",

Assuming there are differences between the patients who develop CSDH and those who do not, we investigated the various known risk factors, along with the computed tomographic findings at the time of the head injury.",

Patients were enrolled prospectively and their medical records were reviewed retrospectively. All the patients did not require surgery at the time of their arrival. During the follow-up period, the 20 patients who required surgery to treat CSDH were designated as the patient group, while the remaining 257 patients who did not develop CSDH after minor head trauma and completed treatment were selected as the control group. Head trauma, out of many other factors, was set as the controlled variable. Age, gender, and the history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, cerebral infarction, cardiac disease, hematologic disease, and epilepsy were investigated as the factors contributing to progression of CSDH after minor trauma. The medication history of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents was also surveyed, as well as the smoking and drinking habits of subjects. The presence of acute subdural hematoma (AS-DH) in the convexity, accompanying hemorrhage and encephalomalacia, and the maximum distance from skull to cerebral parenchyma ( Figure 1) were investigated by examining the patients' initial computerized tomography (CT) scans. In our study, cardiac disease included valve disease, arrhythmia, and ischemic heart disease. The diseases that could cause coagulopathy, such as hematological malignancies, were defined as hematologic disease. In cases where the patients' initial brain CT scans showed cerebral contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, epidural hemorrhage, or intracerebral hemorrhage, we defined the finding as an accompanying hemorrhage. The statistical analysis was performed using Window SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical analyses included chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the relationship between CSDH and various factors. Differences were considered statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05.",

However, considering the fact that one of the major complications of DM is capillary vasculopathy such as retinal hemorrhage, and the fact that micro-bleedings and the exudation of immature capillaries surrounding the CSDH outer membrane are the major mechanisms in developing CSDH, the capillary vasculopathy in DM patients affects the immature capillaries around the outer membrane of the subdural hematoma after head trauma, and consequently results in the development CSDH. 20) Also, in the case of patients with hypertension, higher blood pressures put more pressure on the immature capillaries around the outer membrane have to endure, increasing the probability of repeated capillary injuries and microbleedings. Even though there are few preexisting studies on the impact of hypertension on the CSDH, 8) additional studies need to be performed to confirm a correlation between hypertension and CSDH.",

            "text": "It is known that the old age is associated with CSDH, as there is a higher CSDH prevalence rate among the elderly. 1,5,6) The fragility of the bridging veins and accompany-ing cerebral atrophy from the aging process are considered as the major factors causing the increased prevalence. 5,19) As aging progresses, the volume of the cerebral parenchyma shrinks, resulting in an increase of the subdural space between the skull and the cerebral parenchyma. The enlarged subdural space enables the brain to move around the skull while patient ambulates, and the vulnerable bridging veins can be injured easily with a minor head trauma. 9,12,23) The correlation between the occurrence of CSDH and old age was also confirmed in this study, and there was a tendency to develop post-traumatic CSDH among the patients with larger subdural spaces due to cerebral atrophy. The reason why the history of cerebral infarction and the presence of encephalomalacia are correlated with CSDH occurrence in this study can be explained by considering the same mechanism described above. The presence of encephalomalacia after the brain injury, such as cerebral infarction, results in the reduction of brain parenchyma volume, which enlarges the subdural space between the skull and brain parenchyma, and consequently results in higher tendency of post-traumatic CSDH. 16) A study from Lindvall and Koskinen, 10) which analyzed 71 patients with CSDH concluded that the administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents contributed a significant difference in CSDH occurrence in the patients without trauma compared to the patients with trauma. Another  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the maximal distance between the skull and brain parenchyme. In a ROC curve, the true positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted against the false positive rate (1-specificity) for different cut-off points of a parameter. In this graph, 3.52 mm is the cutoff value of 90.0% sensitivity and 90.7% specificity. The area under the ROC curve is a measurement of how well a parameter can distinguish between two groups. Here, the maximal depth between the skull and brain parenchyma is a good parameter for distinguishing between the two groups.  study conducted by Reymond et al. 17) analyzing 198 patients with severe head trauma also reported that there was a statistical significance between the administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents in CSDH occurrence.",

However, there was no statistically significant difference between using anticoagulation agents and the occurrence of CSDH, while there was a significant correlation between the use of antiplatelet agents and the occurrence of CSDH. While the preceding studies analyzed patients who already developed CSDH or had severe head trauma, we included all the patients with minor head trauma, which may explain the difference in the outcome. Also, the fact that the patient group only had a limited number of the patients may be related to the difference as well. It was expected that there would be a correlation between CSDH occurrence and the patients with cerebral infarction or with cardiac disease, as they are commonly administered antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. 10) The actual study showed a higher ratio of patients with cerebral infarction or cardiac disease in the patient group than in the control group. However, only the history of cerebral infarction demonstrated a statistically significant difference, while the presence of cardiac disease failed to show a statistical significance. With regard to cerebral infarction, aside from using antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, other co-factors, such as a decrease in brain volume due to encephalomalacia after infarction, could influence the outcome. Also, the insufficient number of the patients analyzed in the patient group is likely the reason why we could not find a significance relationship between CSDH occurrence and the presence of cardiac disease.",
