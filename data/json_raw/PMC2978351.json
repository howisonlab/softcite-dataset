We describe the fast and simple All-Codon Scanning (ACS) strategy that creates a defined gene library wherein each individual codon within a specific target region is changed into all possible codons with only a single codon change per mutagenesis product. ACS is based on a multiplexed overlapping mutagenesis primer design that saturates only the targeted gene region with single codon changes. We have used ACS to produce single amino-acid changes in small and large regions of the human tumor suppressor protein p53 to identify single amino-acid substitutions that can restore activity to inactive p53 found in human cancers. Single-tube reactions were used to saturate defined 30-nt regions with all possible codon changes. The same technique was used in 20 parallel reactions to scan the 600-bp fragment encoding the entire p53 core domain. Identification of several novel p53 cancer rescue mutations demonstrated the utility of the ACS approach. ACS is a fast, simple and versatile method, which is useful for protein structure-function analyses and protein design or evolution problems.",

            "text": "A simple and efficient approach that scans across a defined gene region and systematically produces all possible single-codon mutations within that region would be highly desirable for many applications. Random mutagenesis, coupled with genetic screening or selection strategies to identify desired phenotypes, is often used to isolate proteins with modified activities or to identify critical residues in proteins (1)(2)(3). Protein-coding DNA regions are typically mutagenized in vitro using codon cassette mutagenesis, site-directed mutagenesis, chemical modification of nucleotides, or error-prone PCR conditions (4)(5)(6)(7). Error-prone PCR-based strategies are biased towards certain nucleotides or nucleotide combinations, rarely produce two or three base changes in a single codon, typically do not achieve saturation, may introduce multiple amino acid changes per product, and cannot be controlled in detail. Codon cassette mutagenesis requires specific sequence conditions and targets a single codon at a time, thus requiring considerable effort if saturation of extended gene regions is desired (5,8). More directed approaches, such as site-directed mutagenesis or its extensions to alanine scanning (9) and iterative saturation mutagenesis (10), sample only selected residues and are labor-intensive for saturation mutagenesis of large gene regions or whole genes. The All-Codon Scanning (ACS) strategy presented here overcomes many of the above restrictions. ACS allows the systematic change of each codon in a defined gene region into all other codons, while yielding only a single changed codon per mutagenesis product.",

            "text": "ACS mutagenesis of small and large regions of the human tumor suppressor gene p53 was used here to identify amino acid changes that can restore activity of p53 mutants found in human cancer. The p53 gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that is a key cellular defense against cancer (11). p53 mutations occur in $50% of human cancers, and about three-quarters of those mutations are single-point missense mutations in the p53 core domain (12,13). Restoring p53 activity in human tumors is therefore theoretically possible. Indeed, reactivated p53 holds great therapeutic promise because animal models have shown that reintroduction of active p53, even in advanced tumors, leads to tumor regression (14)(15)(16). As demonstrated in vivo, p53 cancer mutants can be reactivated through intragenic second-site suppressor mutations (17)(18)(19). These so-called 'cancer rescue' mutations suggest that drugs mimicking suppressor mutations might be designed (20). Therefore, studies on cancer rescue mutations aim to identify regions in p53 where perturbations may cause p53 reactivation. Cancer rescue mutations may also influence protein-protein interactions or protein stability without necessarily inducing major structural disruptions. Thus, identification of many or all p53 cancer rescue mutations could provide a better structurefunction understanding of the phenomenon of p53 reactivation and support future drug development efforts.",

Several computational approaches exist that allow the design of synthetic DNA molecules and encompass a number of DNA sequence-determined properties without changing the encoded protein sequence (21)(22)(23)(24)(25). This is of course possible because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, and allows simultaneous optimization for several arbitrarily specified sequence properties, such as its own self-assembly, codon usage (26), GC/AT ratio (27,28), translational kinetics (29), codon-pair bias (30)(31)(32) and other DNA structural scales (33). Particularly useful for the ACS strategy is the Computational Optimized DNA Assembly (CODA) system (34), which exploits the degeneracy of the genetic code to perform multiple sequence optimizations, including removal of deleterious RNA crosshybridizations and secondary structures. The resulting global thermodynamic optimization of the DNA sequence implies that every location in the gene is assigned a globally unique thermodynamic address. However, any modern gene design software that removes RNA cross-hybridizations and secondary structure may be used instead of CODA.",

NNN yields all possible codons and so reduces the possibility of codonlevel effects that might interfere with translation or expression (e.g. rare codons or bad codon pairs), while the stop codons are inactive in our genetic selection and so were not seen. The ACS method can be modified easily to use NNK or NNS (or any desired triplets) for use where there was less concern about codon-level effects or stop codons would be deleterious. Similarly, in applications where DNA synthesis bias would be a concern, custom preparation of oligonucleotides with balanced base ratios is available (http://www.idtdna.com/catalog/analytical/ Page1.aspx).",

The PCR products were purified (QIAquick TM PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Germany) and used to generate p53-expression plasmids in yeast using the gap-repair strategy (35). To identify mutations that reactivate p53 cancer mutants we used a p53-tester yeast strain. Growth of this yeast strain in medium lacking uracil depends on active p53 because the URA3 gene is engineered to be under transcriptional control of p53 (18,36). The plasmid pTW300, which is a centromeric plasmid expressing human p53 under control of the ADH1 promoter (36), was gapped with AgeI/StuI. These restriction sites are positioned so that the ACS final PCR products overlapped with both ends of the gapped plasmids by at least 60 nt at both sites. Taking advantage of the highly efficient homologous recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 500 ng of the PCR products and 500 ng of the gapped plasmid were co-transformed into yeast strain RB379. The p53-tester yeast strain RB379 was engineered so that expression of the URA3 gene is dependent on active p53 (18). Cells were directly plated onto SC plates lacking uracil and incubated at 37 C, thus selecting for repaired, functional plasmids and a possibly functional p53 molecule. These plasmids were directly sequenced from yeast cells, after colony-PCR amplification (Genewiz, San Diego, CA, USA).",

We observed a very high mutagenesis efficiency (>95%), which we attribute to the unique thermodynamic profile of the synthetic gene design. The melting temperature distributions of the CODA-designed p53 sequence show a melting temperature gap of 20 C ( Figure 1B). Thus, correct annealing of any given oligonucleotide was strongly favored over hybridization at an incorrect position. Even with a 3-nt mismatch mutagenesis oligonucleotide, the temperature gap between correct hybridizations and incorrect hybridizations remained at a very selective 15 C. This high thermal gap avoids annealing to incorrect gene locations and solves one of the main obstacles to efficiently produce sequence-defined multiplexed DNA libraries (33).",

These 10 cancer mutants were used for ACS mutagenesis of amino acid region 114-123. Note that one of these p53 mutants (p53 R158L ) was used in the ACS experiment targeting region 232-241. Region 114-123 was considered a potential cancer rescue region because multiple amino acid changes occurred there spontaneously in previous cancer rescue mutant screens but no single amino acid change cancer rescue mutations had been found previously [(36); Brachmann, R. K., personal communication]. In addition, a structure-based computational classifier trained to predict regions in p53 that likely contain cancer rescue mutations selected region 114-123 (39).

Three of the isolated uracil prototroph strains contained wild-type p53, which was likely a result of reversion of the cancer mutation due to selection pressure. However, the vast majority of sequences (143) retained the cancer mutation. A total of 13 different potential rescue mutants showed both the cancer mutation and a second mutation that changed the amino acid sequence in the mutagenized region. All potential rescue mutants were regenerated using site directed mutagenesis, transformed into the p53-tester yeast strain, and analyzed for their ability to confer uracil prototrophy (Figure 4). All rescue mutations were confirmed. Six of them had a strong reactivation activity, whereas seven showed only a very small gain in activity compared to the cancer mutant and were not further tested (Table 2). We measured p53 activity of the strong rescue mutants in  human H1299 cells, which lack endogenous p53 activity. p53 cancer mutants and rescue mutants were expressed in H1299 cells and activity was measured using a p53-dependent luciferase reporter (18)  (Figure 4). Without exception, mutations confirmed in the yeastbased screen also reactivated p53 cancer mutants in human cells. All p53 cancer rescue mutants identified in amino acid region 114-123 were new and had not been identified by previous error-prone PCR mutagenesis approaches using the same yeast-based p53 activity assay. ACS resulted in a mutant that reactivated the p53 cancer mutant p53 P152L , which had not been rescued before. Importantly, three out of the six identified amino acid changes that strongly reactivated p53 cancer mutants required 2-or 3-nt changes.

Eventually, however, random reversion to wild-type p53 turned out to be insignificant. We also chose to analyze p53 R273H , the most common cancer mutant that differs by 2-nt changes from wild-type p53, to avoid altogether the possibility of spontaneous reversion. Neither cancer mutant had been rescued previously by intragenic single amino acid changes, and thus might have been too stringent an initial test case for ACS.

The ACS approach is fast, simple, and generally applicable to any problem that requires systematic changes of defined regions in a DNA sequence, including protein design, directed evolution, structure/function analyses and promoter studies. Individual ACS mutagenesis reactions can target changes in a single codon (or even a single base pair position) for as many as 30 contiguous base pairs. The upper base pair target limit restricts primer length to avoid incorporation of mutations due to primer synthesis errors, considering a typical error rate of one per 600 synthesized nucleotides (40)(41)(42)(43). By performing parallel reactions, mutagenesis can be expanded to larger regions or whole genes. The ACS system allows complete control over the target regions; specific gene sections, or even specific nucleotides, easily can be protected from mutagenesis. Thus, ACS is an adaptable and versatile tool.",

            "text": "To understand better the regions selected and their relationship to the p53 protein, it is helpful to consider molecular visualizations of p53 ( Figure 5). Cancer mutations are indicated in red and rescue mutations in green. The 3D locations are consistent with the hypothesis that different p53 cancer rescue mutants require different rescue mechanisms (44)(45)(46), and suggest that different rescue regions may correspond to distinct modes of cancer mutant reactivation. For example, rescue mutations for the p53 cancer mutant p53 R273H are located in distinct regions that do not overlap with rescue regions associated with other cancer mutants ( Figure 5). A comprehensive identification of such rescue regions using ACS or similar approaches may contribute to targeted drug development, as it helps to identify surface exposed, drug accessible sites on p53 where perturbations may result in reactivation.",

            "text": "A significant proportion of human tumors express full length but mutated, inactive p53. Consequently, there are ongoing efforts to find small molecule drugs that mimic the cancer rescue effect of reactivating p53 second-site suppressor mutations (44,45,47,48). Despite impressive progress, efforts are hampered by a limited understanding of the p53 mutation-structure/function relationship (13,46,49,50). The ACS strategy described here has expanded and diversified the collection of rescue mutations that reactivate p53 cancer mutants. We hope that these efforts will lead to further insight into general structural changes that can rescue p53 cancer mutants, and thereby facilitate rational drug design approaches that seek to exploit similar effects.",
