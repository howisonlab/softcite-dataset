Lack of social acceptance is a barrier to patients receiving proper medication and emotional/ psychological support. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the individual factors of social acceptance in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Patients and Methods: Fifty HIV-infected patients who were registered in the Behavioral Consultation Center entered the study. Each of them filled out a questionnaire based on the Crown-Marlow social acceptance scale. Their answers were evaluated according to the questionnaire key. Results: Forty-five patients (90%) were male and five (10%) were female. Their ages ranged between 28 and 52 years old. Other variables researched in this study include patients' age, sex, education, occupation, place of living, marital status, family history of HIV, and family history of psychological disorders. Employed patients experienced more social acceptance than housewives and people who were unemployed or retired. Conclusions: This study showed that HIV-infected patients with jobs enjoy a great deal of acceptance from the people around them and a higher quality of life in general. It also led to suggestions for further study with the purpose of finding more effective solutions for HIV prevention and better strategies for dealing with psychological disorders. Such research could also help in providing an enhanced understanding of the potential psychological impact that AIDS has on patients in Iran.",

Scores of 0-8 represent the people who were most likely excluded from society yet who were not looking for answers to their lack of social acceptance. The score range 9 -19 indicates that there was an average social acceptance of the patients' behavior, a result that is consistent with the social behavior in general. A score in between 20 and 33 demonstrates a high level of social acceptance, implying that the patients' actual behavior was very compatible with the rule sand norms of the society around them.

The data analysis indicated that the social acceptance level of these patients is not associated with their education level, since the differences among the groups of patients with different education levels is not significant (P = 0.913). This fact may be due to the lack of post-graduate education in the patients involved in this study; otherwise, we would have expected a significant difference in the social acceptance of patients based on each one's level of education.",

Nevertheless, another study that was conducted in Kenya, Namibia, and Tanzania demonstrated that greater levels of depressive symptoms in HIV-positive patients were related to the factors of younger age and being female (14). These results may be consequences of low social support received by young people and female in those countries in general. However, another study indicated that gender was not a factor in determining any differences in identified psychiatric outcomes (6). Unfortunately, at the moment, there are no explanations for the conflicting results obtained from these additional studies. Further investigations need to be conducted in order to answer the question of why some factors have not achieved clear statistical significance in our research. That being said, it is also important to note that our study suffered from a major drawback: A very low number of patients participating in the study consequently, this disadvantage may very well have affected our findings and, in turn, the interpretation of the number of variables. Moreover, since the current study was one of the first to evaluate the different factors affecting social acceptance of HIV-positive patients in Iran, we faced a very limited availability of information at the time of this study, hindering our ability to accurately interpret the results we obtained. Needless to say, then, a great deal of work still remains to be done on researching this issue, which remains controversial.",

Consequently, the findings of the present study suggest that the social acceptance of patients working in nongovernmental organizations is more than that of unemployed and retired patients. These results are consistent with an earlier study in China, which was conducted on individuals with AIDS in order to document unemployment as a risk factor for suicidal ideation in these patients (7). Also, a study in Ethiopia confirmed the vital role employment play sin improving AIDS patients' quality of life, and consequently, in increasing social acceptance of them as well (15). This evidence shows that having a job provides patients with not only as source of income, but also a social community, which in turn increases their opportunity to enjoy greater social ac-ceptance. Various other sources of research on this topic also confirm that stigmatization of patients infected with HIV/AIDS is strongly related to the amount of fear of HIV and awareness about it that exist at the community level. Since people's attitudes are partly formed through social influence and social knowledge, relevant public-health interventions must be considered for reducing HIV/AIDS stigma in society. Thus, attention should be drawn to the role of social influences as HIV/ AIDS stigma intervention (16). In addition, clinical interventions such as complementary therapies and behavioral-medicine interventions should be established for people living with HIV/AIDS, since these treatments have reportedly improved patients' quality of life (14).",

In comparison, results of a research project conducted in the United States indicate mild levels of depression and anxiety manifestations, as well as a moderate mean score of social acceptance, in the HIV-infected patients. The patients adapted to their difficult health condition by using positive reconstitution, coping methods, and social acceptance (17). The increasing trend to establish care and treatment services throughout the country will give more medical personnel the opportunity to provide holistic mental and psychosocial health care for people living with HIV.",
