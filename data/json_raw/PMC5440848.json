            "text": "The primary objective of this study was to analyze the relationships between bone microstructure and strength, and male osteoporosis risk factors including age, body mass index, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, and testosterone level. A secondary objective was to compare microstructural and strength parameters between men with normal, low, and osteoporosis-range areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Methods: Seventy-eight healthy male volunteers (mean age 62.4 \u00b1 7.8 years, range 50-84 years) were recruited. The participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) of the ultra-distal radius and tibia. From the HR-pQCT images, volumetric bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical and trabecular bone microstructure were evaluated, and bone strength and cortical load fraction (Ct.LF) were estimated using micro-finite element analysis (\u03bcFEA). Results: Age was more strongly correlated with bone microstructure than other risk factors. Age had significant positive correlations with cortical porosity at both ultra-distal radius and tibia (r = 0.36, p = 0.001, and r = 0.47, p b 0.001, respectively). At the tibia, age was negatively correlated with cortical BMD, whereas it was positively correlated with trabecular BMD. In \u03bcFEA, age was negatively correlated with Ct.LF, although not with bone strength. Compared with men with normal aBMD, men with low or osteoporosis-range aBMD had significantly poor trabecular bone microstructure and lower bone strength at the both sites, while there was no significant difference in cortical bone. Conclusions: Cortical bone microstructure was negatively affected by aging, and there was a suggestion that the influence of aging may be particularly important at the weight-bearing sites."

According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, about one out of two women and one out of four men over 50 years old will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their remaining lifetime (National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2002). While the incidence rate is lower in men, men with osteoporosis-related fracture have higher morbidity and mortality rates than women (Center et al., 1999;Morin et al., 2010). As the average age of the population continues to increase, the incidence of male osteoporosis is expected to increase significantly.",

In addition, the application of micro finite-element (\u03bcFE) analysis permits the estimation of bone strength (Boyd, 2008). How these microstructural and strength parameters relate to areal bone mineral density (BMD) in men is unclear. Further, it is unclear how microstructural and strength parameters are affected by male osteoporosis risk factors including advanced age, low body weight, physical inactivity, hypogonadism, heavy smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, vitamin D deficiency, and inadequate calcium intake (Papaioannou et al., 2008;Ebeling, 2008; Bartl and Frisch, 2009).",

All contours were examined manually and modified as necessary to delineate the periosteal boundary. Integral volumetric BMD was quantified based on the periosteal segmentation. A threshold-based process was used to segment cortical and trabecular regions for compartment-specific measurements of density and structure (Laib et al., 1998). Trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) was calculated based on trabecular BMD (Tb.BMD) assuming a tissue mineral density of 1200 mg HA/cm 3 . Trabecular number (Tb.N) was calculated directly by a model-independent sphere fitting technique (Hildebrand et al., 1999;Laib et al., 1997). Based on the calculated BV/ TV and Tb.N values, trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) were derived using standard histomorophometric relations assuming a plate model (Laib and R\u00fcegsegger, 1999).",

The binary image data set was converted to a mesh of voxels (isotropic) using a conversion technique (M\u00fcller and R\u00fcegsegger, 1995), and each element was assigned an elastic modulus of 6.829 GPa (Boyd, 2008) and a Poisson's ratio of 0.3 (van Rietbergen et al., 1996). Cortical and trabecular bone elements were labeled as different materials, with identical material properties to facilitate calculation of compartmental load distribution. A uniaxial compression test in the axial direction (superior-inferior) was performed with an applied uniaxial compressive strain of 1%. An iterative solver (Scanco FE software v.1.15; Scanco Medcal AG, Br\u00fcttisellen, Switzerland) was used to compute reaction forces at the proximal and distal ends of the scan region for the proscribed displacements. For each model, stiffness (K), apparent modulus (E), and the load fraction for the cortical compartment at the distal boundary (Ct.LF dist) and the proximal boundary (Ct.LF prox) were calculated. Furthermore, failure load (F) was estimated using methods previously described by Mueller et al. (2011).",

            "text": "Aging is recognized as the most important risk factor for male osteoporosis (Bartl and Frisch, 2009). We observed that age had a correlation with microstructure; cortical porosity and cortical bone mineral density were affected by age, especially at the tibia, a weight-bearing site (Table 2). Our findings were similar to those of Nicks et al. (2012), who compared the bone microstructure of the distal radius and tibia in men under vs. over the age of 50 using HR-pQCT; they reported that cortical porosity was significantly higher in older men, while there was not a significant difference between younger and older men in trabecular bone microstructure. In contrast, when Hansen et al. (2013) reported age-related change of bone microstructure at the radius and tibia in  men aged 20 to 80 years using HR-pQCT, they showed that trabecular bone as well as cortical bone were weakened with aging. In our study, tibial cortical bone microstructure was weakened and load fraction for the cortical compartment was decreasing with aging. Conversely, trabecular bone microstructure became stronger with aging, albeit with a weak correlation. Furthermore, there was no relationship between bone strength and age. Therefore, these findings raise the possibility that while cortical bone is weakened with aging, bone strength is maintained with compensatory strengthening of trabecular bone microstructure. However, our observations were limited to a cohort of men ages 50-84 years. Aging presumably affects the bones in a number of ways, including telomere shortening (Bekaert et al., 2005), reduced secretion of the sex steroids such as testosterone or estrogen (Khosla et al., 1998), and a decrease in muscle mass (Szulc et al., 2012). We did not observe a significant relationship between serum testosterone levels and bone  microstructure, but it has been shown previously that the age-related decline of estrogen has a stronger effect on the bone compared to testosterone (Khosla et al., 2001). Looker and Mussolino (2008) reported that lower serum vitamin D levels significantly increase the risk of hip fracture in men and women over 65 years old. In that study of people over the age of 65, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is high; 26% of them had serum 25(OH)D level under 20 ng/mL (Orwoll et al., 2009). In our study, 30% of all cases had serum vitamin D deficiency (data not shown). We also detected 25(OH)D level had an unexpected modest positive association with cortical porosity, and a negative association with Ct.BMD at the tibia. We suspect that these associations may have been confounded by age, as age was positively associated with both 25(OH)D level (r = 0.26, p = 0.02, data not shown) and cortical porosity, and negatively associated with Ct.BMD.",

The 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic or hip fracture had significant relationships with cortical parameter, especially at the UDT. Similarly, FRAX score had significant relationships with bone strength. Future research should determine whether cortical bone microstructure and strength may actually improve the predictive ability of the FRAX model or be an alternate tool for fracture risk prediction."

As the cortical porosity progresses, bone mechanical strength is lowered (Schaffler and Burr, 1988). Nishiyama et al. (2010) compared the microstructure differences between postmenopausal women with normal, low, or osteoporosisrange aBMD; it was shown that women with both low bone mass and osteoporosis had lower Ct.Th and greater Ct.Po. In the present study, we compared men over 50 years old with normal, low, or osteoporosis-range aBMD. Men with osteoporosis and low bone mass had trabecular bone fragility and lower bone strength in both distal radius and tibia; however, there were no significant differences in cortical bone microstructure at the both sites (Table 4). In addition, DXA T-score had no correlation with Ct.Po (Table 3); therefore, DXA is likely not sensitive enough to capture differences in cortical porosity in elderly men. We observed a relatively strong relationship between DXA aBMD and trabecular bone parameters. However, the FRAX score had a stronger relationship with cortical bone parameters compared to trabecular bone parameters, despite the fact that FRAX was calculated from aBMD. A cohort study by Bala et al. (2014) found Ct.Po at the ultra-distal radius was an independent discriminator of forearm fracture in osteopenic, but not osteoporotic women. Therefore, Ct.Po measured by HR-pQCT could provide unique information relevant to fracture discrimination, while trabecular bone microstructure measures may not add significant power beyond aBMD.",

Cortical bone microstructure was negatively affected by aging, and there was a suggestion that the influence of aging may be particularly important at the weight-bearing sites. Bone strength might be maintained during aging by means of the compensatory strengthening of trabecular bone. When we compared the men with normal, low, and osteoporosisrange aBMD, men with osteoporosis and low bone mass had significantly weak trabecular bone microstructure and bone strength at both the distal radius and tibia, but no significant differences in cortical bone parameters at both sites. Tb.BMD is not really independent of aBMD and therefore will not likely identify those in these groups that are at high risk of fracture. On the other hand, Ct.Po may provide unique discriminatory power in addition to aBMD, based on its poor correlation to aBMD and strong correlation with aging."
