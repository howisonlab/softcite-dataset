We investigated difference of parameters of polysomnography, cephalometry and dynamic multi-detector computerized tomography (MD-CT) in wake and sleep states according to obesity. Methods. We evaluated 93 patients who underwent polysomnography and cephalometry. MD-CT was performed in 68 of these 93 patients. Fifty-nine and 34 patients were classified as obese and non-obese, with obesity defined as BMI \u226525. Cephalometry results were analyzed for 12 variables. Using the MD-CT, we evaluated dynamic upper airway morphology in wake and sleep states and divided the upper airway into four parts named as high retropalatal (HRP), low retropalatal (LRP), high retroglossal (HRG), and low retroglossal (LRG). A minimal cross sectional area (mCSA) and collapsibility index (CI) were calculated for each airway level. Results. Diastolic blood pressure (P=0.0005), neck circumference (P<0.0001), and apnea-hypopnea index (P<0.0001) were statistically significantly different between the obese and non-obese group. Among 12 cephalometric variables, there was a significant difference in only the distance from mandibular plane to hyoid bone (P=0.003). There was statistical difference in CI of HRG and LRG in sleep state (P=0.0449, 0.0281) but no difference in mCSA in wake and sleep states. Conclusion. The obese group had more severe sleep apnea than the non-obese group. We believe that the increased severity of apnea in the obese group may be have been due to increased collapsibility of the upper airway rather than decreased size of the upper airway."

Twelve standard bony and soft-tissue measurements, commonly reported to show changes in OSAS, were obtained. First, the following measurements were made: distance from mandibular plane to hyoid bone (MP-H), distance from velum tip to pharyngeal wall parallel to Frankfurt horizontal line (PAS), posterior nasal spine to velum tip-soft palate length (SPL), condyle to gnathion-total mandibular length (Man TL), gonion to gnathionmandibular body length (Man BL), and condyle to gonionmandibular ramus height (Man Ht). The soft palate-soft palate thickness (SPT, widest measurement), pharyngeal length (PhL), the smallest anteroposterior dimension of the retropalatal space (RP), and the retroglossal space (RG) were also gauged.

            "text": "The pathogenesis of OSA is known to be very complex and is not yet fully understood. The major pathophysiology is sleeprelated collapse of the upper airway (13), with anatomic factors and pharyngeal collapsibility known to play a part. Several methods have been employed to locate regions of upper airway obstrtuction: cephalometry, fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy, fluoroscopy, CT and MRI (6). Each of these methods has several disadvantages. Cephalometry produces only two-dimensional static images and allows anteroposterior dimension measurement, but not lateral dimension measurement. While MRI can provide a cross-sectional image of organs, the required data acquisition time is long, with resultant motion artifacts due to breathing and swallowing. Cephalometry, MRI and CT are performed in the wake state. The meaningfulness of their results is therefore limited as the upper airway is known to change dynamically during sleep. Fluoroscopy (14), EBT (15), and MD-CT (12), on the other hand, are used for dynamic radiographic examination of the upper airway. The disadvantages of fluoroscopy are that, as with cephalometry, the airway is shown in only two dimensions with measurement possible in the anteroposterior dimension, but not the lateral dimension. Furthermore, fluoroscopic examination leads to significant radiation exposure. In the case of EBT, Ye et al. (15) showed it to have the potential to provide information quickly and with no effect on upper airway dynamics. Comparing EBT and MD-CT, we previously reported that EBT and MD-CT were efficient modalities for dynamic upper airway mechanics, and that the results of MD-CT were similar to those of EBT (12). Additionally, MD-CT had superior resolution and was less expensive in terms of maintenance than EBT.",

Static pharyngeal size modulated by dynamic loading of the airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may also contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA (18). One study reported weight loss to be related to increase in upper airway cross-sectional area, and that this could improve AHI (5).

We found positive association between obesity and hypertension and inferred that there was an interrelationship between hypertension and sleep apnea. The NC was significantly associated with apnea and snoring (20), so larger neck circumference may be associated with greater severity of OSA. The NC of obese patients was statistically significant higher compared to non-obese patients in our study. In another study, the obese patients were shown to have higher AHI values, and a correlation between NC and AHI (21). Our results were consistent with these findings. It was reported that in both non-obese and obese OSA patients, skeletal changes were often evident in cephalometric values (8). Displacement of the hyoid bone may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA (21). Ferguson et al. (11) found that increased MP-H is related to increased neck circumference. The hyoid bone is important as an anchorage for the tongue muscle, and increased MP-H distance is the result of increased soft tissue and fat deposition in the tongue. A previous study has reported that OSA patients showed a significant correlation between an increased MP-H distance and a higher AHI (22). However, another study reported that the difference in the position of the hyoid bone in non-obese and obese OSA patients was not significant, and that in obese patients upper airway soft tissue enlargement may play a more important role in the development of obstructive sleep apnea, whereas in non-obese patients, bony structure discrepancies may be the dominant contributing factors for obstructive sleep apnea (10). In our study, inferior shift of the hyoid bone, reflected by increased MP-H, was significantly associated with obesity. This suggests that displacement of the hyoid bone may contribute to OSA.",

            "text": "Two mechanisms for upper airway occlusion during sleep have been put forward: a neural hypothesis and an anatomic theory (23). The neural hypothesis involves decreased neural output to pharyngeal dilator muscles during sleep, leading to muscle hypotonia. The anatomic theory submits that upper airway collapsibility may be affected by soft tissue and body facial anatomy: fat deposits around the pharynx, hypertrophied adenoids and tonsils, macroglossia, retrognathia and micrognathia. Several studies using CT scanning have reported that upper airway collapse occurred at the oropharyngeal level, and that oropharyngeal narrowing at the level of the uvula, soft palate, and retrolingual space was the principle site of obstruction in OSA (24)(25)(26). Also, CT scanning during wakefulness may not predict the development of airway obstruction as the upper airway moves dynamically during respiration. In this study, the MD-CT was carried out in the wake and sleep states. We found that retroglossal area (HRG, LRG) in the obese group (wake or sleep states) was not narrower compared with that of the nonobese group, suggesting that anatomical narrowing is not an important factor aggravating OSA in the obese group. However, the CI of HRG and LRG was significantly increased in the obese group, suggesting that the neural hypothesis is a more important causative factor of OSA.",
