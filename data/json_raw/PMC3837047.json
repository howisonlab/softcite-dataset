            "text": "We studied the change in the first-phase insulin response (FPIR) during the progression to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Seventy-four oral insulin trial progressors to T1D from the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 with at least one FPIR measurement after baseline and before diagnosis were studied. The FPIR was examined longitudinally in 26 progressors who had FPIR measurements during each of the 3 years before diagnosis. The association between the change from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR and time to diagnosis was studied in the remainder (n = 48). The 74 progressors had lower baseline FPIR values than nonprogressors (n = 270), with adjustments made for age and BMI. In the longitudinal analysis of the 26 progressors, there was a greater decline in the FPIR from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis than from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis. This accelerated decline was also evident in a regression analysis of the 48 remaining progressors in whom the rate of decline became more marked with the approaching diagnosis. The patterns of decline were similar between the longitudinal and regression analyses. There is an acceleration of decline in the FPIR during the progression to T1D, which becomes especially marked between 1.5 and 0.5 years before diagnosis. Diabetes 62:4179-4183, 2013 A low first-phase insulin response (FPIR) to intravenous glucose is considered to be an indicator of faltering b-cell function and is a predictor of type 1 diabetes (T1D) (1-4), yet there have been no descriptions of changes in the FPIR during the progression to T1D. Such information could be of value for optimizing the timing of interventions to prevent the loss of b-cells. We have used, therefore, FPIR measurements from the serial intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs) obtained in the oral insulin trial of the Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1) (5) to describe the decline of the FPIR during the progression to T1D.",

All oral insulin trial participants were relatives of T1D patients who were positive for islet cell autoantibodies and insulin autoantibodies. The participants initially had normal oral glucose tolerance (fasting glucose value ,110 mg/dL; 30-, 60-, and 90-min values ,200 mg/dL; 2-h value ,140 mg/dL) and were above defined FPIR thresholds ($100 mU/mL for $8.0 years [with the exception of $60 mU/mL for parents of T1D patients], $60 mU/mL for ,8.0 years). IVGTTs were performed at baseline and at yearly intervals. DPT-1 parenteral trial participants (6) were not included in the analyses because they only had IVGTTs at 2-year intervals, and many in that trial were selected on the basis of having low FPIR values. T1D was diagnosed either through oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) surveillance according to standard American Diabetes Association criteria or through clinical presentation. Two nonprogressors with baseline FPIR values of 675 mU/mL and 953 mU/mL (474 mU/mL being the next highest value) were excluded from the analysis because they were outliers. In addition, three others were excluded because of missing values.",

Samples were obtained in the fasting state and at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 min. The FPIR was defined as the sum of the insulin measurements at 1 and 3 min. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay (coefficient of variation ,8.5%) (7). There was high cross-reactivity with proinsulin. Autoantibody procedures for DPT-1 have been previously described (8). Data analysis. For progressors to be included in the analysis, in addition to the baseline FPIR measurement, at least one additional FPIR measurement before diagnosis was required. There were 74 progressors who fulfilled this criterion of whom 44 (59%) were diagnosed through OGTT surveillance. (Supplementary  Table 1 shows that there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the progressors included in and the progressors excluded from the analysis.) There were no significant differences between the 35 (47%) receiving oral insulin and the 39 (53%) receiving placebo in the baseline FPIR values or in the changes from the baseline FPIR to the last FPIR. Two analyses were used to examine changes in the FPIR during the progression to T1D in these individuals. A longitudinal analysis (analysis 1) examined serial FPIR values in the 26 progressors who had three IVGTTS after the baseline IVGTT: 2-3 years before diagnosis, 1-2 years before diagnosis, and within 1 year of diagnosis (see flowchart in the Supplementary Data).

Aside from the younger age of the progressors (P = 0.003), there were initially no significant differences in FPIR, log BMI, and sex. However, because the FPIR was associated with both age (r = 0.17, P = 0.001) and log BMI (r = 0.38, P , 0.001), we compared the FPIR between the progressors and the nonprogressors after adjusting for those variables. The baseline FPIR was significantly lower in the progressors (P , 0.020) with the adjustments. Additionally, with adjustments for age and sex, the BMI was significantly higher in the progressors (P = 0.035). The median duration of follow-up for the oral insulin trial participants was 4.3 years. Analysis 1. Twenty-six of the 74 progressors analyzed had FPIR measurements at baseline (mean 6 SD 4.4 6 3.4 years before diagnosis), ,3.0 to $2.0 years before diagnosis (2.5 6 0.3 years), ,2.0 to $ 1.0 year before diagnosis (1.5 6 0.3 years), and ,1.0 year before diagnosis (0.5 6 0.2 years).

(Data are presented in the table and below according to the mean time from diagnosis of the FPIR measurements within each yearlong interval.) There was a small decline in the FPIR from baseline until 1.5 years before diagnosis, with no evidence of acceleration. The decline then accelerated from 1.5 years before diagnosis to 0.5 years before diagnosis. The median (25th, 75th percentile) percent change in FPIR from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis was 24.1% (229.8%, 30.2%, not significant), whereas the median percent change from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis was 229.3% (256.4%, -3.5%, P 5 0.001). Of the 26 progressors, the FPIR declined in 21 from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis and in 14 from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis. Compared with the change from 2.5 to 1.5 years before diagnosis, there was a decline (vs. a prior increase) or a more marked decline from 1.5 to 0.5 years before diagnosis in 16.

The interval between the last FPIR measurement and diagnosis was 0.76 6 0.66 years.

Still, the data show that the decline in the FPIR becomes more rapid as the diagnosis of T1D approaches. The acceleration appears to become especially marked between 1.5 and 0.5 years before diagnosis. Of note, this time period appears to coincide with the time that the loss of b-cell sensitivity to glucose becomes appreciable (9). The overall loss of the FPIR from the baseline measurement to the last measurement was marked in the 26 progressors followed longitudinally, with a decline of 47.7% by 0.5 years before diagnosis. However, the extent of insulin loss before diagnosis is almost certainly greater for several reasons. It is likely that there already had been some loss of the FPIR before the baseline measurement because the baseline FPIR values were lower in the progressors than in the nonprogressors with adjustments for age and BMI. In addition, the shape of the curves in Fig. 2 and data from an analysis of serial OGTTs (10) suggest that the rate of decline could be even greater during the last 6 months before diagnosis. Finally, DPT-1 participants were mostly diagnosed through OGTT surveillance rather than through clinical presentation (11).",

It is possible that an impaired b-cell could be particularly susceptible to small changes in glucose concentration; however, there are no data available to support this.",
