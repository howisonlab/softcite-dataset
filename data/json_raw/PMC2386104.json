In particular, translational regulation contributes to the spatio-temporal pattern of gene expression in animal development. For example, the expression of Oskar, which is required for pole plasm formation ( Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard, 1986 ), is regulated by translational repression via an RNA-binding protein, Bruno ( Nakamura et al., 2004 ). RNA-binding proteins are important in translational regulation, with critical roles in stem cell maintenance in planarians (e.g., bruno-like protein [ Guo et al., 2006 ]) and mammalian neural stem cells (NSCs) (e.g., Musashi1 protein Sakakibara et al., 2002 ]).",

            "text": "The Musashi family is an evolutionarily conserved group of neural RNA-binding proteins that contain two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and has representatives in vertebrates and invertebrates (for review see Okano et al., 2002 ). We previously identifi ed Musashi-binding sequences in mammals  and Drosophila ( Okabe et al., 2001 ). In the mammalian nervous system, Musashi1 (Msi1) is expressed in neural precursor cells, including NSCs ( Sakakibara et al., 1996 ). Our previous studies revealed that Msi1 contributes to NSC maintenance by binding to the 3 \u0408 -untranslated region (UTR) of one of its target mRNAs, m-Numb , and repressing its translation . m-Numb encodes a membrane-associated protein that inhibits Notch signaling ( Spana and Doe, 1996 ). Thus, Msi1 probably contributes to maintenance of the stem cell state by repressing the translation of its downstream target genes. In addition, Msi1 acts cooperatively with Musashi2 (a second mammalian Msi protein) in the proliferation and maintenance of NSCs ( Sakakibara et al., 2002 ). However, the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the Msi1-mediated translational repression has not been clarifi ed. M usashi1 (Msi1) is an RNA-binding protein that is highly expressed in neural stem cells. We previously reported that Msi1 contributes to the maintenance of the immature state and self-renewal activity of neural stem cells through translational repression of m-Numb . However, its translation repression mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we identify poly(A) binding protein (PABP) as an Msi1-binding protein, and fi nd Msi1 competes with eIF4G for PABP binding. This competition inhibits translation initiation of Msi1 ' s target mRNA. Indeed, deletion of the PABP-interacting domain in Msi1 abolishes its function. We demonstrate that Msi1 inhibits the assembly of the 80S, but not the 48S, ribosome complex. Consistent with these conclusions, Msi1 colocalizes with PABP and is recruited into stress granules, which contain the stalled preinitiation complex. However, Msi1 with mutations in two RNA recognition motifs fails to accumulate into stress granules. These results provide insight into the mechanism by which sequence-specifi c translational repression occurs in stem cells through the control of translation initiation.",

As shown in Fig. 1 C , the interaction between PABP and Msi1 was less sensitive to RNase A than that between IMP3 and Msi1 (lanes 3 to 4). These results suggest that Msi1 interacts directly with PABP, but indirectly with IMP3. This idea was supported by in vivo and in vitro GST pull-down assays using GST-PABP ( Fig. S1, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb .200708004/DC1). In addition, the interaction between eIF4E and Msi1 was only weakly detectable in this assay, and that between eIF4G and Msi1 was even less clear.

To examine whether the C-terminal PABP-binding region is required for Msi1 ' s function as a translational repressor, we performed assays using Translational regulation usually occurs at the translation initiation step, in which recruitment of the 40S ribosome to the mRNA is rate limiting ( Muckenthaler et al., 1998 ;Chekulaeva et al., 2006 ). Numerous eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) contribute to translation initiation. One of these, eIF4G, is an essential and multifunctional scaffold protein ( Gingras et al., 1999 ). It is a subunit of the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex, which associates with the mRNA m 7 G cap and facilitates ribosome joining to the mRNA ( Kahvejian et al., 2005 ). Two other components are the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A. eIF4G interacts with eIF4E, eIF4A, and the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which stimulates initiation factor recruitment to mRNA and leads to mRNA circularization ( Imataka et al., 1998 ;Kahvejian et al., 2005 ). The PABP -eIF4G interaction seems to be vital for effi cient translation, and it stimulates the formation on mRNA of both the 48S and 80S ribosome complexes ( Kahvejian et al., 2005 ).",

Thus, although SGs and PBs are distinct RNA-containing granules, they share some components and seem to physically and functionally interact with each other.",

A time-course reporter assay with the Msi1-D2 mutant, which lacks the PABP-interacting domain, failed to bind PABP, and revealed a correlation between failure to bind PABP and failure to repress translation. We also found that Msi1 localizes to the cytoplasm and accumulates in SGs under stress, where it colocalizes with PABP. Our results indicate that Msi1 inhibits the cap-dependent translation of its target mRNAs by competing with eIF4G to bind PABP, and inhibiting formation of the 80S ribosome complex. Thus, we present a mechanism for selective posttranslational regulation by the neural RNA-binding protein Msi1.",

In this system, the action of an object binding to its ligand is detected as a decrease in resonance frequency (mass increase). Purifi ed Msi1 or eIF4G was immobilized on the Au-surface-coated QCM plate by binding the His-tag of His-Msi1 or His-eIF4G to orient the molecules, and purifi ed GST-PABP in an aqueous solution was injected as the binding counterpart ( Fig. 3 D ). The addition of GST-PABP (100 nM) to the reaction solution with immobilized Msi1, eIF4G, or eIF4G 41 -244 resulted in typical frequency decreases, representing the frequency of immobilized PABP ( Fig. 3 E ). However, the change in individual resonance frequency when PABP was added to immobilized molecules that were not expected to bind it (eIF4G 41-244mut and Msi1-D2) was barely detectable ( Fig. 3 E ), indicating that the specifi c interactions of Msi1 -PABP and eIF4G -PABP were detectable by the resonance frequency curve.",

We analyzed these data by curve fi tting, according to the manufacturer ' s instructions (see Materials and methods for details). The K d value was estimated from the ratio of k off to k on .

After stringent washing, the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-PABP antibody. Almost no PABP coprecipitated with FLAG resin alone ( Fig. 3 C , right, lane 7). Preincubation with 5.4 pmol GST or GST-Msi1-D2 did not interfere with PABP ' s association with Flag-eIF4G (compare lane 9 with 10), whereas GST-Msi1 (1.8, 3.6, or 5.4 pmol) decreased the amount of GST-PABP precipitated.

In addition, the 48S preinitiation complex is selectively recruited to SGs ( Kedersha et al., 2002 ). To examine whether Msi1 is involved in ribosome complex formation, 80S ribosome binding assays were performed with cap-fLuc-MCS-poly(A) reporter mRNA as described previously ( Kahvejian et al., 2005 ). The 3 \u0408 -end 32 P-labeled reporter mRNA and various GST proteins were incubated with RRL in the presence of cycloheximide, and the mixtures were applied to a 15 -30% sucrose density gradient ( Kahvejian et al., 2005 ), subjected to ultracentrifugation, fractioned, and the radioactivity of each fraction was counted. The addition of GST-Msi1 strikingly decreased the 80S ribosome complex formation, to 52.7% ( n = 4) of the control level, represented as a peak in the 19th or 20th fraction, whereas the addition of equimolar amounts of GST-Msi1-D2 had no effect on the 80S ribosome complex formation ( Fig. 5 E ), suggesting the Msi1 -PABP interaction is required for this inhibitory mechanism. Therefore, Msi1 inhibits the recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit onto mRNA, and the Msi1 -PABP interaction is probably required to inhibit the assembly of the 80S ribosome initiation complex.",

All the deletion mutants -CdelG, CdelI, and Msi1-D2 (which lack the PABPinteracting domain) -colocalized to eIF4G as clear marker of Lysates were subjected to subcellular fractionation as described previously ( Aoki et al., 2002 ). Msi1 and PABP were detected mainly in the heavy-sedimenting particles in P100 fraction ( Fig. 4 C , lane 3), with most of the ribosomes ( Fig. 4 C , bottom,  lane 3). After RNase treatment, both Msi1 and PABP were also detected in the soluble S100 fraction ( Fig. 4 C , lane 5), suggesting that Msi1 coexists with PABP in heavy-sedimenting RNP particles, which are likely to represent mRNPs. Furthermore, we investigated the polysome profi les in 15 -40% sucrose gradients using lysates of stressed or unstressed P19 cells. After heat stress, although some of the PABP was partly detected in the heavy (polysome) fractions, most of it was in the light fractions ( Fig. 4 D ). Msi1 and eIFs remained mostly in the light fractions after both conditions, and the fractionation pattern of eIFs coincided with that of a previous study ( Kedersha et al., 2002 ). These data indicate that Msi1 comigrates with eIFs and PABP, and is likely to be involved in the regulation of translation initiation.",

            "text": "Because SGs contain the stalled translation initiation complex ( Kedersha et al., 2002 ), Msi1 ' s localization to SGs, its comigration with eIFs ( Fig. 4 ), and its binding to PABP in competition with eIF4G ( Fig. 3 ), suggested that Msi1 could be involved in the regulation of translation initiation. To examine whether the translational repression by Msi1 is cap dependent, we added GST-Msi1 to RRL, using either cap, EMCV IRES, or HCV IRES to drive the translation of fLuc reporter mRNA containing MCS or MCSmut in its 3 \u0408 UTR before poly(A) ( Fig. 5 A ), and measured the amount of reporter produced. HCV IRES-, but not EMCV IRES-directed translation initiation is also independent of eIF4G ( Pestova et al., 1998 ). In RRL, endogenous Msi1 is not detectable (unpublished data), but eukaryotic translation initiation factors and PABP are present ( Imataka et al., 1998 ;Kahvejian et al., 2005 ). We found \u202b\u0641\u202c 50.6 \u00b1 3.0% ( n = 4) inhibition of the cap-dependent translation by GST-Msi1, compared with \u202b\u0641\u202c 27.0 \u00b1 6.2% and \u202b\u0641\u202c 35.9 \u00b1 1.2% decreases in the EMCV IRES-and HCV IRES-directed translation of the MCS-containing reporter mRNA, respectively, whereas GST-Msi1-D2 had little effect on reporter mRNA containing MCS or MCSmut ( Fig. 5 A ). We also conducted Northern blot analyses to evaluate the amount of reporter RNA (cap-rfLuc-MCS-poly(A) RNA) in each assay, and found that it was barely altered by the addition of the tested proteins (Fig. S3, available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb .200708004/DC1). These observations suggest that Msi1 represses cap-dependent translation and exerts selective translational repression through Msi1-binding sequences in the 3 \u0408 UTR of its target mRNAs.",

In addition, although SGs contain most of the components of the translational 48S preinitiation complex, such as eIF4E, eIF4G, PABP, and the small ribosomal subunit, they do not include the large ribosomal subunit ( Kedersha et al., 2002 ;Anderson and Kedersha, 2006 ). Our present fi ndings suggest that Msi1 represses translation initiation, possibly by perturbing the function of eIF4G, and these events may take place in SGs under stress. That SGs lack the large ribosomal subunit is consistent with our model that Msi1 inhibits the formation of the 80S ribosomal complex ( Fig. 7 ). In addition, because two RRMs are required for the accurate intracellular distribution of Msi1, the localization of Msi1 may occur via capture of its target mRNA.",

The poly(A) tails of mRNAs expressed in the oocyte are often relatively short. Our model postulates that Msi1 participates in translational regulation by binding to PABP that is coupled with an elongated poly(A) tail. Msi1 may promote PABP stability by binding to PABP, and the stabilized PABP may maintain an extended poly(A) tail in the oocyte.

            "text": "The biological activity of stem cells in many tissues is regulated by translational and transcriptional controls. In particular, Msi1 helps establish stem cell identity and/or the maintenance of stem cell status, given that Msi1 is strongly expressed in various types of stem cells, including NSCs  and intestinal stem cells ( Potten et al., 2003 ), and its target mRNAs are involved in stem cell regulation. A recent report indicates that translational repression by Musashi is required intrinsically to maintain Drosophila germline stem cell identity ( Siddall et al., 2006 ). Another group reported that the Msi1-mediated translational repression of p21 waf1 mRNA is needed for cell cycle progression ( Battelli et al., 2006 ). These Msi1 functions depend on the translational repression mechanism revealed in this paper. For example, in response to environmental stress (e.g., hypoxia), cells, probably including neural stem/precursor cells (NSPCs), reprogram their translational machinery and sort mRNAs that are released from polysomes to SGs ( Kedersha et al., 1999 ;Stohr et al., 2006 ). Hypoxia promotes the survival and proliferation of several NSPCs ( Studer et al., 2000 ), indicating that NSPCs may elicit SGs and respond to stress via translational repression. In the present study, we show that Msi1 represses translation initiation under ordinary conditions, and sometimes repression events also take place in SGs under stress. Our previous studies revealed that Msi1 functions in neural stem cell maintenance by binding to its target gene, m-Numb , and repressing its translation , and that it is involved in the self-renewal of neural stem cells ( Sakakibara et al., 2002 ). Collectively, these results indicate that Msi1 is likely to play an important role in translation in the cytoplasm under ordinary conditions and in SGs under stress conditions, via its inhibition of translational initiation. In addition, the colocalization of Msi1 and eIF4G was high in the VZ (where neural precursor cells are dominant) but not in the cortical plate (where differentiated neuronal cells dominate), in good agreement with our model, and these fi ndings lead to further research focused on the translational control of NSCs. However, the mechanism for the indirect and partial inhibition of eIF4G functions remains to be elucidated.",

Relevantly, Sonenberg ' s group suggested that both the 40S and the 60S ribosomal subunit recruitment steps are separate targets of PABP, although their underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated ( Kahvejian et al., 2005 ). Thus, Msi1 could exert its regulatory function at some distinct steps among the multiple stages of translational initiation by binding to PABP.

First, Msi1 might be post-translationally modifi ed and inactivated by factors in the RRL, rendering it incapable of binding PABP; an example of this is the Maskin -CPEB interaction, which is regulated by phosphorylation ( Groisman et al., 2002 ). Second, Msi1 binding may be hindered by a unilateral PABP-binding protein like Paip1 ( Roy et al., 2002 ) or an unknown factor. Third, to compete with the eIF4G-PABP, Msi1 may need to recognize an accessible conformation of the 3 \u0408 UTR in its target mRNA. Most 3 \u0408 UTRs containing poly(A) tails, which bind to multiple PABPs, are probably too fl exible. Such structural flexibility leads to a situation in which Msi1 incompletely inhibits the interaction between PABP and eIF4G, even if the number of Msi1 molecules on the 3 \u0408 UTR is greater than that of PABP. Indeed, Msi1 incompletely represses the translation of its target mRNA ( Figs. 2 E and 5 A ; Imai et al., 2001 ). Thus, because the competition with the eIF4G -PABP interaction by Msi1 may be necessary for the fl exibility and energy-requiring dynamic conformational changes of the 3 \u0408 UTR, no inhibition of 48S formation and incomplete inhibition of 80S formation may occur. Fourth, Msi1 may indirectly regulate molecules that are infl uenced by PABP and promote the 80S ribosomal complex. For example, in yeast, the poly(A)/PABP interaction inhibits Slh1p and Ski2p, which in turn inhibits eIF5 and eIF5B, which promote 80S ribosomal formation ( Searfoss et al., 2001 ). To elucidate these events, further work is needed to clarify the relationship between Msi1 ' s function and the detailed molecular mechanisms of ribosome formation.",

The precipitated proteins were detected by immunoblotting. In vitro competition assays were performed in TC buffer without 1 mM DTT as described previously ( Khaleghpour et al., 2001 ). First, GST-PABP (5.4 pmol) was mixed with 1.8, 3.6, or 5.4 pmol of GST-Msi1 in 10 \u03bc l of reaction mixture, and incubated for 1 h at 4 \u00b0 C. Second, the mixture was incubated again with 10 \u03bc l of anti-FLAG M2 resin (Sigma-Aldrich) conjugated with Flag-eIF4G (41 -1560)-His for 1 h at 4 \u00b0 C. Third, to remove unbound GST-PABP, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of TC buffer. In vivo competition assays were also performed in TC buffer without 1 mM DTT, as described previously ( Khaleghpour et al., 2001 ). 293T cells expressing both Flag-eIF4GN and Myc-Msi1 were homogenized and spun at 20,400 g .
