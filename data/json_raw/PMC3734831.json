This notion is supported by biochemical studies demonstrating aberrant recruitment of epigenetic enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases to promoter regions through association with oncogenic fusion proteins such as PML-RARa and AML1-ETO. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are potent inducers of tumor cell apoptosis; however, it remains unclear why tumor cells are more sensitive to HDACi-induced cell death than normal cells. Herein, we assessed the biological and molecular responses of isogenic normal and transformed cells to the FDA-approved HDACi vorinostat and romidepsin. Both HDACi selectively killed cells of diverse tissue origin that had been transformed through the serial introduction of different oncogenes. Time-course microarray expression profiling revealed that normal and transformed cells transcriptionally responded to vorinostat treatment. Over 4200 genes responded differently to vorinostat in normal and transformed cells and gene ontology and pathway analyses identified a tumor-cell-selective pro-apoptotic gene-expression signature that consisted of BCL2 family genes. In particular, HDACi induced tumor-cell-selective upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene BMF and downregulation of the pro-survival gene BCL2A1 encoding BFL-1. Maintenance of BFL-1 levels in transformed cells through forced expression conferred vorinostat resistance, indicating that specific and selective engagement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway underlies the tumor-cell-selective apoptotic activities of these agents. The ability of HDACi to affect the growth and survival of tumor cells whilst leaving normal cells relatively unharmed is fundamental to their successful clinical application. This study provides new insight into the transcriptional effects of HDACi in human donor-matched normal and transformed cells, and implicates specific molecules and pathways in the tumorselective cytotoxic activity of these compounds.

Time-course gene expression profiling revealed that normal and transformed cells transcriptionally responded to HDACi treatment; however, 4200 genes responded differently to vorinostat treatment in normal and transformed cells. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analyses identified a tumor-cellselective pro-apoptotic gene-expression signature containing effectors of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Regulation of a pro-apoptotic BCL2-family gene signature correlated with the relative sensitivity of transformed cells to HDACi-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, a role for HDACi-mediated repression of BCL2A1 in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis was confirmed, and we formally demonstrated that forced expression of BFL-1 encoded by BCL2A1 suppressed the apoptotic effects of vorinostat in transformed BJ fibroblasts. Collectively, these data enhance our understanding of the molecular consequences of HDAC inhibition, and provide a mechanistic basis for the tumor-selective biological effects of these agents.",

Matched normal (BJ) and transformed (BJ LTSTERas) fibroblasts were treated with vorinostat over 72 h, and cell death was analyzed (Figures 1a and b). Following 24 h vorinostat treatment, there was a marginal increase in death of transformed BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts that increased substantially following extended drug exposure. BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts were significantly more sensitive to vorinostat than BJ cells ( Figures  1a and b). Vorinostat induced comparable time-dependent hyperacetylation of histone H3 ( Figure 1c) and a-tubulin ( Figure 1d) in both cell types, suggesting that the relative resistance of normal cells to vorinostat-mediated apoptosis was not due to a failure of vorinostat to inhibit HDACs in these cells. We next tested the sensitivity of BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts to romidepsin, an HDACi that selectively inhibits class I HDACs. [20][21][22] BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts were more sensitive than BJ cells to romidepsin-induced apoptosis, even though there was equivalent acetylation of histone H3 in romidepsin-treated BJ and BJ LSTERas fibroblasts ( Figures  1e and f). As a-tubulin is deacetylated by HDAC6 that is not effectively inhibited by romidepsin, romidepsin did not induce hyperacetylation of a-tubulin.",

We hypothesized that tumor-cell-selective gene expression changes underpinned the differential sensitivity of isogenic tumor and normal cells to HDACi-induced apoptosis. To investigate whether de novo protein synthesis was required for HDACi-induced death, BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts were pre-treated for 1 h with cycloheximide (CHX) before the addition of vorinostat. CHX treatment significantly inhibited vorinostat-mediated apoptosis after 48 h of drug treatment (Figures 2a and b). Given the requirement of de novo protein expression for the induction of apoptosis by vorinostat, a time-course microarray study was conducted. An early (4 h) and intermediate (12 h) time point was selected for the microarray study on the basis of candidate quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses of CDKN1A (Figures 2c and d), a gene commonly induced by HDACi. 20,24 CDKN1A mRNA was induced by vorinostat in BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells; however, the magnitude of induction was greater in transformed cells (Figures 2c and  d). The abundance of CDKN1A mRNA in BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells after 24 h of vorinostat treatment was similar, as the threshold cycle (Ct) values relative to the control gene RPL32 were similar in both cell types (data not shown). The hyper-induction of CDKN1A in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts over time reflects the lower basal expression in these cells (at time 0 h).",

We identified probe sets that responded differently to vorinostat treatment in matched normal and transformed cells (contrast probe sets) at any of the three time points (relative to time 0 h), as we hypothesized that contrast gene expression might underpin the different biological responses of donor-matched cells to vorinostat treatment. In total, 5959 contrast probe sets were identified and these were differently regulated by vorinostat in terms of either the direction (induction or repression) or the magnitude (degree of induction or repression) of the vorinostat response in BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells. Of the 5959 contrast probe sets, 2945 were equally expressed in untreated normal and tumor cells. However, 6226 of the 9240 probe sets with basal expression differences did not respond differently to vorinostat in the two cell types. These data indicated that the basal gene expression levels did not determine the capacity of genes to differently respond to vorinostat treatment in BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. GO and pathway analyses were performed on the contrast gene list using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) tool ( Figure 3b). 'Cell Death' was the most significantly represented molecular and cellular function associated with contrast genes (false discovery rate (FDR) \u00bc 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 23 ) while genes involved 'cell-cycle' (FDR \u00bc 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 21 ) and 'cellular growth and proliferation' (FDR \u00bc 4 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 20 ) were also significantly represented on the contrast list. We further analyzed the contrast responses, in particular those genes that were selectively or hyper-induced in BJ LTSTERas cells compared with BJ cells, using GO analyses and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Genes involved in 'induction of programmed cell death' (P \u00bc 0.0130) and 'apoptotic program' (P \u00bc 0.0024) were over-represented in vorinostat-treated BJ LSTRas cells compared with BJ cells (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Many genes encoding components of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway were   (Figures 4a and b). Only a mild tumor-selective induction of TNFRSF10B (DR5/TRAILR2) was observed. We did not observe any transcriptional modulation of genes encoding death receptor ligands in response to vorinostat in either cell type (Figures 4a and b). Moreover, the genes encoding FADD (FADD), caspase 8 (CASP8) and BID were downregulated in BJ and BJ LTSTERas, suggesting that death receptor signaling was transcriptionally repressed by vorinostat in BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. Collectively, the downregulation of genes encoding receptors, adaptors and proteolytic intermediaries in the death receptor pathway suggested that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway was unlikely to play a substantial role in promoting selective apoptosis of BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts.",

BCL2L11 (encoding BIM) was transcriptionally induced in normal and transformed BJ fibroblasts following vorinostat treatment, and BCL2L11 induction at the 4 h time point (by qRT-PCR) was consistently greater in the normal cells (Figure 5b). Seven Affymetrix probe sets map to BCL2L11. Interestingly, three of these probe sets responded to vorinostat in both cell types and three probe sets were selectively induced in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts in a timedependent manner ( Supplementary Figure 2). BMF was shown by us and others to be a primary HDACi response gene. [27][28][29] In our microarray analyses, BMF was classified as a non-responding gene most likely due to the combined effects of low basal expression and the location of the sole probe set (226530_at) toward the 5 0 end of the BMF transcripts. The expression of BMF using qRT-PCR demonstrated that the gene was hyper-induced by vorinostat in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts (Figure 5b).

Furthermore, BCL2A1 was induced 22-fold (rather than repressed over time as observed with HDACi) in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts by etoposide treatment. Etoposide was however clearly capable of modulating proapoptotic gene expression in matched fibroblasts, and caused the hyper-induction of BAK1 in BJ LTSTERas cells with a considerably higher magnitude than the changes induced by vorinostat or romidepsin.

We aimed to determine whether donor-matched normal and transformed cells demonstrate the same or different gene expression profiles following HDACi treatment. Time-course microarray expression profiling revealed that normal and transformed cells transcriptionally responded to HDACi treatment, and that vorinostat signatures resembled other HDACi signatures in the Cmap database. Therefore, it appears that diverse HDACi modulate the expression of a common set of genes, irrespective of cellular phenotype or the tissues from which cells were originally isolated, and that a restricted set of genes are particularly amenable to transcriptional modulation following HDACi treatment. Many genes responded differently to vorinostat treatment in normal and transformed cells and a tumor-cell-selective pro-apoptotic gene-expression signature was identified. A role for HDACi-mediated repression of BCL2A1 in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis was confirmed, and we formally demonstrated that the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was required for the cytotoxic activities of HDACi in transformed BJ fibroblasts.",

By contrast, we found RAP1A to be more highly induced in normal BJ fibroblasts than in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that any contribution of RAP1A towards HDACi-mediated cytotoxicity is likely to be celltype-dependent. Noh et al. 36 investigated the transcriptional responses of non-donor-matched normal bronchial epithelium and lung cancer cells following TSA treatment. That study showed TSA mediated tumor-selective induction of CDKN1A and tumor-selective repression of ERBB2, 36 both of which were also tumor-cell-selective events in our microarray study. Chiba et al. 37 reported on the transcriptional responses of non-donor-matched hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In agreement with our study, an approximately equal number of genes were activated and repressed in normal cells following HDACi treatment, although in our study a considerably higher percentage of total genes on the array were significantly modulated by vorinostat. 38 Previous studies had proposed that altered ROS production and differential expression of ROS scavengers governs the differential sensitivity of normal and transformed cells to HDACi-mediated apoptosis. [31][32][33] We did not observe any vorinostat-mediated transcriptional alteration in thioredoxin gene (TXN) expression in normal or transformed cells. Moreover, the gene encoding TBP-2 (TXNIP) was equivalently induced with vorinostat treatment in both cell types. Therefore, vorinostat-mediated transcriptional modulation of TXN and TXNIP was unlikely to be a direct determinant of normal BJ fibroblast resistance, or transformed BJ fibroblast sensitivity to vorinostat-mediated apoptosis.",

[39][40][41] The regulation of BCL2 family genes by HDACi in normal cells has to our knowledge not previously been investigated, making this study the first to characterize a vorinostat-mediated BCL2 family transcriptional signature in donor-matched normal and transformed cells. The vorinostatregulated BCL2 family genes identified herein (e.g., BMF, BCL2L11, PMAIP1, BCL2L1) have also been shown in independent studies to impinge upon HDACi-mediated apoptosis in tumor cells, 16,27,[42][43][44][45] suggesting that tumorcell-selective regulation of pro-apoptotic genes might be a common mechanism employed by HDACi to exert their tumorselective cytotoxic effect. BCL2L11 and BMF were rapidly induced early by vorinostat, indicating that they may be primary HDACi-response genes as has been reported in the literature for BMF. 27 Despite the early transcriptional induction, an increase in BMF protein (selectively in tumor cells) was detected considerably later (24 h), and was consistent with BMF being a possible mediator of apoptosis in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. Previous reports suggested that elevated BIM expression alone (through deregulated E2F-1 activity) by HDACi was sufficient to induce apoptosis in E1A-expressing human fibroblasts. 43,44 Moreover, BIM was reportedly important for the induction of apoptosis by HDACi in leukemic cell lines and primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 42 We did observe vorinostat-and romidepsin-mediated induction of BCL2L11 mRNA by microarray and qRT-PCR in normal and transformed cells. Moreover, BIM EL protein levels were elevated in both normal and transformed cells well before the onset of apoptosis (BIM induction was observed at 4 h). These data were, therefore, inconsistent with BIM being the critical mediator of tumor-cell-selective apoptosis in the BJ fibroblast system and support the notion that BIM might instead cooperate with the many other HDACi-induced BH3only proteins (such as BMF and BIK) to induce apoptosis in sensitive cells.",

A recent report demonstrated a correlation between vorinotatmediated induction of BMF, NOXA and BCL2L11 and histone H4 hyperacetylation within the promoter regions of these genes following HDACi treatment. 42 Whether such a correlation between HDACi-mediated selective induction of gene expression and promoter histone acetylation occurs on a global scale and is the basis for the tumor cell-specific effects of these anti-cancer agents remains to be determined.",

Empirical Bayes moderated t-tests were used to assess differential expression between the BJ and BJLTSTERas fibroblasts and between untreated and treated cells. [48][49][50] Specifically, baseline differences between the cell lines were identified by comparing untreated BJ and to BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts at time 0 h. Probe sets responding to DMSO or vorinostat were identified by comparing each of the 4, 12 or 24 h time points back to untreated cells, and this was done separately for BJ and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. For all comparisons, probe sets were considered to be significantly differentially expressed if the fold-change exceeded 1.5 (i.e., 50% difference in expression) and the FDR was o0.05. 51 Probe sets responding differently to vorinostat treatment in BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts as compared with BJ cells (i.e., contrast genes), were identified using empirical Bayes moderated F-tests. 49,50 F-tests allowed us to combine information across the three treatment time points, looking for probe-sets with differing responses at any of the times. First we used an F-test to find probe sets whose gene expression changes (from 0 h to any of 4, 12 or 24 h vorinostat treatment) were different in BJ fibroblasts compared with BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts. This test is analogous to testing for interaction in a two-way ANOVA. Second, we subtracted from this list any probe set whose expression response to vorinostat could not be distinguished from that to DMSO (the vehicle control). To do this, we used an F-test to find probe sets whose response to vorinostat relative to DMSO was different between BJ fibroblasts and BJ LTSTERas fibroblasts at any of the paired time points. Only probe sets detected by both the above F-tests were retained in the contrast list. The final contrast list contained therefore only bona fide vorinostatresponding genes. For all F-tests, probe sets were considered statistically significant if the FDR was o0.05 and at least one comparison involved in the test achieved a 1.5-fold change.",

Probe sets with statistically significantly (F-test) responses to vorinostat at any time were ranked by their expression fold-change at 24 h versus 0 h, and this was performed separately for BJ and BJ LTSTERas cells. The 500 most induced and 500 most repressed probe sets were uploaded into the Connectivity Map (Cmap) v02 (http://www.broad.mit.edu/cmap). Cmap ranked drug compounds with gene expression signatures similar to the uploaded gene lists on the basis of connectivity P-values and enrichment scores. 25 Cmap required Affymetrix HG U133A probe set identifiers, so the identifiers from our HG U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays were mapped back to equivalent HG 133A probe sets using the NetAffx analysis center (http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/ index.affx).",
