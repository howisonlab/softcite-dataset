            "text": "Background/Aims: Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been implicated in the survival and progression of some cancer cells, by compensating for endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulating the protein-folding capacity. However, its prognostic role in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been investigated. Methods: We collected HCC tissues from 83 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection for an immunohistochemical study of PDI. Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of surgical resection until the date of death from any cause. Radiological progression was evaluated using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors in an independent radiological assessment. Results: PDI expression was found to be increased in human HCC compared to adjacent nontumor tissues. Increased immunopositivity for PDI was associated with a high Edmondson-Steiner grade (p = 0.028). Univariate analysis of patients who had undergone surgical resection for HCC showed that tumor PDI upregulation is a significant risk factor for poor OS (p = 0.016; hazard ratio [HR], 1.980) and time to progression (TTP; p = 0.007; HR, 1.971). Multivariate analyses revealed that high PDI expression was an independent predictor of a shorter TTP (p = 0.015; HR, 1.865) and poor OS (p = 0.012; HR, 2.069). Conclusions: Upregulated PDI expression is associated with aggressive clinicopathological features of HCC; thus, PDI might serve as an independent prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target for HCC patients."

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth-leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Curative resection is the primary therapeutic modality for HCC, except in advanced cases, but the prognosis of individ-ual patients varies and several molecular markers of the prognosis of HCC have been identified [2]. Unfortunately, few molecular markers for HCC are targetable by drugs and there is a pressing need to identify new molecular candidates to improve therapeutic strategies and predict the prognosis in the era of targeted an-A novel prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma: protein disulfide isomerase ti-cancer therapy. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a 57-kDa dithiol:disulfide oxidoreductase and molecular chaperone. It is one of the most abundant soluble proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by mediating oxidative protein folding [3]. PDI expression is upregulated in some cancer types and involved in aggressive phenotypes of breast [4], brain [5], ovary [6], and prostate [7] cancers. Increasing evidence from functional studies indicates that PDI has an important role in tumor survival and cancer progression [3]. In human HCC cell lines, PDI was expressed in a hypoxia-inducible manner [8]. However, the expression of PDI in human HCC tissues and its prognostic role in patients with HCC has not been determined.",

We performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis to investigate whether PDI expression was an independent predictor of TTP and OS. PDI expression was an independent predictor of tumor recurrence (p = 0.015). Large tumor size was also an independent predictor of TTP (p = 0.017) ( Table 3). For OS, because histological grade was associated with PDI expression in our correlation study, we included PDI expression in the multivariate analysis to avoid any bias caused by multicollinearity. Indeed, PDI expression was found to be an independent predictor of OS (p = 0.012) (Table 4).  Figure 2.

Moreover, upregulated PDI expression in HCC tissues was an independent risk factor for a poor OS and shorter TTP in patients with HCC. This is the first report that the level of PDI expression adversely affects the OS and pro-gression of HCC patients who have undergone surgical resection. One can argue that the increased PDI level is a byproduct of cancer, such as the cellular environment, disease progression status, or degree of tumor differentiation. However, recent studies indicate that PDI is important for tumor survival and progression, emphasizing its role as a tumor-promoting factor [5,[11][12][13]. PDI expression seems to be associated with protection of cancer cells from proteotoxic stress and hypoxic damage. Hypoxia can induce the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins and lead to ER-stress-induced cell death [14]. Altered ER function results in ER stress and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an important ER stress response that protects the cell by removing unfolded or misfolded proteins [15]. PDI proteins are key molecules in the UPR. Many ER-stress-response chaperones have PDI activity or PDI-like domains; therefore, blocking this activity might increase ER stress and enhance apoptosis [16].",

Moreover, HCC sometimes undergoes an infiltrating rather than a mass-forming growth pattern; these advanced infiltrative HCCs seldom show hypervascularity, grow more rapidly, and have a poorer prognosis than the mass-forming hypervascular types. These findings suggest that hypoxia activates the signals that allow HCC cells to survive and proliferate [18] and that PDI contributes to the survival and progression of these cancer cells. This explains the correlation between PDI expression and an aggressive cancer phenotype.",

            "text": "The expression of PDI family proteins, an important arm of the UPR, correlates with cancer invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in various tumor types, including melanomas and gliomas [5,11]. UPR, a prosurvival pathway that is activated during hypoxia, which is a hallmark of solid tumors [19], is also an important mediator of metastasis in human cervical cancer [20]. UPR promoted the polarization of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells toward an inflammatory/immunosuppressive phenotype, leading to T-cell dysfunction and, ultimately, to the evasion of tumor cells from immuno-  surveillance [21]. Therefore, we postulate that intratumoral hypoxia induces PDI expression as a component of the UPR, which leads to tumor evasion from immunosurveillance via T-cell dysfunction. The escape from immunosurveillance contributes to cancer recurrence or metastasis [22]. In addition, PDI was reported to be associated with resistance to the growth-inhibitory effects of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), which frequently occurs in cancer cells. TGF-\u03b21 downregulates PDI microRNA in TGF-\u03b21-sensitive cells, but not in cells insensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TGF-\u03b21 [12]. Moreover, PDI protects cancer cells from apoptosis. In melanoma, the inhibition of PDI activity using bacitracin enhanced apoptosis triggered by fenretinide or velcade [13]. Although PDI expression was reported to be increased in the stressful microenvironment of human HCC cell lines and in the serum of HCC patients [23,24], its functional implications in HCC have not been elucidated fully.",

Tumor cells require higher levels of PDI to cope with marked ER stress and a global increase in protein synthesis to sustain rapid proliferation. Increased protein synthesis leads to an abundance of misfolded proteins in the ER that must be refolded by PDI. As such, tumor cells are more vulnerable to PDI inhibition than are normal cells. Therefore, PDI is an important target in the treatment of cancers.",
