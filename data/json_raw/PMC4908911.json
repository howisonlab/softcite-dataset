Since data from our observational study were originally routinely collected as part of a health service without specific a priori research goals, research was conducted and reported in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guideline, 17 an extension of the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines. 18 Details of each call were captured on a standardised form and entered into a Microsoft Access database. These included demographics, enquiry type, relationship of caller to patient and motivation for calling. For each call, up to three generic medicines relating to the question were recorded and categorised by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system of medicines. 19 Of the five ATC levels, we examined medicine classes at the ATC3 level, which labels medicines according to their pharmacological subgroup (eg, antihistamines-systemic), as well as at the ATC5 level, which identifies the chemical substance (eg, chlorpheniramine). Caller location was identified by postal code and grouped by state/territory and Accessibility/ Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA), a measure of the remoteness of areas from service centres. 20 The relative population ratio was determined by dividing percentage of paracetamol calls from each ARIA category by percentage of population living in each ARIA category. Narrative for calls between January 2009 and June 2010 were also recorded electronically. Calls involving paracetamol in the question were extracted for analysis. Remaining calls were classified as 'rest of calls'. We excluded calls that only involved a voicemail request for Consumer Medicines Information (CMI) leaflets.",

Calls originated from all Australian states and territories, with metropolitan, rural and remote dwellers all well represented (relative population ratio living in each ARIA category ranged between 0.6 and 1.09). The majority of paracetamol calls were from females (80.5%), which was not significantly greater than for 'rest of calls' (76.5%, p=0.05). There was a bimodal distribution for caller age, with peaks at 30 and 70 years. Contrastingly, patient age distribution was trimodal, with an additional peak at <1 year. Compared with 'rest of calls', the distribution of caller age for paracetamol calls was skewed towards a younger cohort, with 45.2% made by the 25-44 age group versus 37.5% in 'rest of calls'. Paracetamol calls were significantly more often for patients aged 14 and under (22.1%) versus 'rest of calls' (10.3%, p<0.001). Correspondingly, significantly more paracetamol-related calls were made for a child (23.7%) compared with 'rest of calls' (12.7%, p<0.001). Within calls made about paracetamol, callers for children were much more likely to be female (92.1%) than calls made for themselves or others (76.8%, p<0.001). Over 90% of paracetamol calls were prompted by one of three reasons: inadequate information (47.9%), second opinion (27.2%) or a worrying symptom (15%). Compared with '\\rest of calls', more calls were made for a second opinion (27.2% vs 23.3%, p<0.001).",

[21][22][23] These studies identified paracetamol knowledge gaps for many consumers, as well as healthcare providers having varied knowledge of appropriate use. However, it was difficult to identify a question pattern about paracetamol use from these publications due to diversity in study design. Participants were commonly recruited from a general practice waiting room where they generally responded to questions constructed by the investigators. This is not the same sample frame as our database of spontaneous calls. In general, misinformation about risks was a recurring theme; and this is what our paper also shows. While 'greater education of health care workers is required in order to provide families with appropriate information' 23 was recommended, little research has addressed health professional responses to the information gaps consumers have about paracetamol. Generally, healthcare providers underestimate consumer concerns about medication risk [24][25][26] and do not adequately acknowledge these concerns. 25 27 28 This mismatch was also highlighted in the recent BMJ editorial 2 that addressed only three broad questions as important to paracetamol consumers (efficacy, adverse effects and dose). Our study provides the consumer perspective to this issue.",

In the UK, general sales list medicines, 29 which are freely available in supermarkets, thus come without advice from health professionals. Mandatory information supplied with OTC medicines varies between countries. Pharmaceutical companies in the UK must supply approved Patient Information Leaflets with all medicines unless all necessary information specified by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (including indications, contraindications, general dosing instructions and side effects) is included on the label. 30 The electronic Medicines Compendium, 31 targeted at health professionals, provides additional Summaries of Product Characteristics. The equivalent Australian documents are CMI leaflets and Product Information, neither of which is mandatory for OTC medicines. Aside from Panamax, 32 there are no accessible CMI for common paracetamol-only formulations. Importantly, none of these consumer resources provide strategies to prevent or reduce risk from common occurrences such as redosing after vomiting or reassurance, where appropriate, when planned or inadvertent exposure to paracetamol occurs. Addressing consumer OTC medicine concerns requires information in CMI (or equivalent) to be comprehensible and actionable, targeted for life stage.

            "text": "Consumers have many concerns about paracetamol use that are likely to be under-recognised by healthcare providers, with different patient age groups and life stages having unique questions that should be considered when targeting information towards patients. Therapeutic strategies to minimise paracetamol risk are not adequately addressed by available information. Improving information may be challenging due to the OTC status of paracetamol and the diversity of commercial brands. Strategies such as increasing pharmacist involvement with paracetamol supply may be useful, but may necessitate a change in its unrestricted availability in other places such as supermarkets. Ultimately, the accessibility of information that the public wants to know needs to be targeted to optimise the safe and effective use of paracetamol.",
