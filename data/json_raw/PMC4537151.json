Clinical guidelines continue to be ignored, 1,2 and decision support instruments are inconsistently utilized. 3 Abundant literature attests to the failure of conventional, practitioner-based, educational efforts to change behavior. 4 Finally, a landmark study 5 showed that, despite richness of technology and resources within the United States health care system, only half of Americans receive evidence-based interventions for common and important health conditions.",

In developing the TEACH design we were influenced by literature addressing the fragmentation of conventional training in EBHC as an underlying cause for lack of uptake of research in practice. Specifically, David Eddy had warned that the teaching of evidence-based medicine (EBM) was being confined to the context of health care delivery to individual patients, while evidence-based clinical guidelines and implementation skills were being ignored. 6 Recently, a review of the status of medical education in the United States commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation determined that instruction in quality improvement and multidisciplinary, systemsbased health care constitutes a major deficiency at both undergraduate and graduate levels. 7 We Experience: attended an initial series of three conferences. Improvement projects centered on stroke care, hospital readmissions, and infection control. Successful implementation efforts were characterized by strong support of senior administration, involvement of a broad multidisciplinary constituency within the organization, and on-site facilitation on the part of TEACH faculty. Involvement of nursing management at the senior faculty level led to increased presence of nursing and other disciplines at subsequent conferences.",

An innovative workshop in Rio de Janeiro engages health care managers, policymakers, and clinicians in a multidisciplinary setting, 10 and has more recently incorporated guideline development and implementation into the scope of training. However, training programs in evidence-based practice continue to focus largely upon clinicians and clinical educators and the skill sets applicable to individual patient care. 10,11 In this article, we describe the conceptual design of the TEACH program, our program experience to date including results of institutional participation, and its evolution. In the context of future directions for the program, we also address the process of integrating instruction in principles of computerized decision support (CDS) into the TEACH program and preliminary steps in that direction.",

Validated instruments relevant to all of the TEACH domains did not exist. Furthermore, conference attendees are already asked to do preliminary readings and other preparatory work. Increasing the time burden with cognitive testing during the preconference period seemed unwise. We therefore concentrated evaluation efforts on the use of EBHC knowledge and skill by institutional participants to achieve tangible improvements in care. Between 25 and 40 percent of TEACH participants stem from institutional delegations. In some cases, these participants were clustered into a single workshop group and used a project drawn from their specific institutional interests and needs as the learning vehicle. In other cases, delegations were distributed over the different workshop tracks in order to obtain the broadest possible experience of the conference. Table 3 lists institutional participants by institution type, change agent and project leadership profiles and the nature of projects worked on for a representative sample. Table 4 summarizes the six participating institutions for which outcome data is available. We followed the latter for at least one year following their participation to determine the extent to which projects were carried through to implementation. Although quantitative outcomes were rarely available, one HPO sent delegations of participants to the TEACH conference over a three-year period resulting in a program to decrease heart failure readmissions and reported a 17 percent drop in readmissions during the first year of implementation. Several potential insights emerging from the TEACH program experience with HPOs might be of use to others attempting to link conference and workshop training in EBHC to on-site improvement projects. Specifically, results seemed particularly impressive when the change agent reflected a partnership between senior administration, middle management, and clinical providers, and when the change agent and leadership had prior training in evidencebased practice. Results were less impressive when the change agent and leadership reflected limited roles and interests within the institution. Table 4 broadly suggests a qualitative relationship between the degree of project success and the intensity of facilitation efforts. Potential reasons for failure of project development included lack of leadership, isolated leadership vulnerable to replacement, and the inability to define and efficiently monitor appropriate metrics over time through the use of information technology (IT) and electronic medical record data.",

For example, wrap-up summaries by attendees from different tracks of their activities during the workshop proved distracting and inconsistently engaging. Similarly, a seminar framework in which TEACH faculty presented track-specific content to participants in different tracks resulted in negative participant feedback.

It provides all participants with access to internationally recognized innovators in three major dimensions of EBHC, as well as intensive tutelage in a preferred learning area. The structure of TEACH reflects the complexity inherent in maximizing the contribution of information from research to the quality of health services. This opportunitycombined with the multidisciplinary, team-based makeup of the tracks and small groups and the inclusion of front line health care professionals alongside administrators and policymakersgenerates a compelling learning environment. Over time, organizations-including guideline committees from medical specialty societies-have assigned participants to attend multiple tracks within the conference, maximizing their ability to absorb the key skill sets that characterize the different domains.",

Hence, it may be perceived to have less appeal to practitioners within a small or solo practice environment than to those within large integrated delivery systems. The former's contexts may prevent their directly absorbing the range of knowledge, skills, and activities embodied within the TEACH program. The latter characteristically have their own differentiated frameworks for realizing evidence-based care. However, the TEACH program has something to offer virtually any health care professional likely to enroll in it. Many health care professionals enroll as individuals and are able to increase knowledge and skills they would be exposed to in conventional evidence-based training programs, but within a broader framework of application.",

One such effort offered tracks in different areas related to EBHC, including the GRADE system, knowledge translation, and the conducting of systematic reviews. 28 However, the program was not generated by a unified concept of organizational capacity building and did not address the needs of delegations from HPOs. We believe that TEACH is unique among training programs in EBHC in its systematic identification and incorporation of distinct but essential domains of knowledge, skill, and proficiency. Traditional EBM workshops, largely following the McMaster University model, focus on critical appraisal skills framed within the context of the care of individual patients. 10,11 Additionally, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) conducts seminars for delegations from provider organizations focused on training in quality improvement skills, while the intensive training programs offered by Intermountain Healthcare focus more on the organizational level, also from a quality improvement standpoint. Although quality improvement efforts share goals with those of knowledge translation and the K2A model, they also have differences. 29 Otherwise, the IHI program only marginally overlaps the content of training in EBHC.",

It operates on a breakeven basis within the host institution that provides section discounts on facilities for internally sponsored events. This allows the offering of tuition discounts for students and group rates for participating institutions. Additional fees are required for onsite courses and other facilitation efforts. One institution estimated the total cost of participation over a three-year period to be $100,000, of which $10,000 comprised the cost of conference attendance for approximately 20 individuals, and the remainder reflected costs of personnel timeincluding conference attendance and on-site time requirements-and the salary of an additional fulltime on-site nurse coordinator who was hired as part of an implementation plan to decrease hospital readmissions.",

For example, the ability to collect, mine, and interpret practice-based evidence drawn from EHR data is rapidly becoming a critically important dimension of EBHC. 30 Many smaller HPOs are still in the early stages of developing such capacity. We have observed that the lack of those capabilities frequently disables the ability to create verifiable and sustainable improvements within project frameworks arising from institutional participation in TEACH. Longer-term outcome information on TEACH related projects has proved to be elusive. Furthermore we have not been able to relate actual increases in knowledge and skill on the part of conference participants to demonstrable increases in capacity for EBHC within participating institutions. Lack of validated assessment tools across the full range of required skills 31 renders this an objective that will require longer range development. We believe that we have demonstrated that it is possible for an EBHC training program operating within the scale of conventional EBM workshops to address a minimum range of skill domains required to increase the use of research within organized health care settings. An integrated learning environment for EBHC may provide a context within which principles of CDS may be absorbed in a fashion that increases utilization and effectiveness.",
