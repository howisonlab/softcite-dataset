Persistence with denosumab was found to be higher than with oral bisphosphonates. Purpose This study had two objectives: to analyse persistence in Swedish women initiating denosumab for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) and to put these findings in context by conducting a literature review and meta-analysis of persistence data for oral bisphosphonates. Methods The study used the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and included women aged at least 50 years initiating denosumab between May 2010 and July 2012. One injection of denosumab was defined as 6-month persistence. Women were considered persistent for another 6 months if they filled their next prescription within 6 months+56 days and survival analysis applied to the data. A literature search was conducted in PubMed to identify retrospective studies of persistence with oral bisphosphonates and pooled persistence estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Results The study identified 2,315 women who were incident denosumab users. Mean age was 74 years and 61 % had been previously treated for PMO. At 12 and 24 months, persistence with denosumab was 83 % (95 % CI, 81-84 %) and 62 % (95 % CI, 60-65 %), respectively. The literature search identified 40 articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. At 12 and 24 months, persistence with oral bisphosphonates ranged from 10 % to 78 % and from 16 % to 46 %, with pooled estimates of 45 % and 30 %, respectively. Conclusion These data from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register and literature review suggest that persistence was higher with denosumab than with oral bisphosphonates.",

            "text": "There are several treatments available for osteoporosis, which have the primary aim of reducing the risk of fracture [2,3]. For optimal outcomes, patients need to take their treatment according to the dosing instructions and for the prescribed duration (i.e., they need to be both compliant and persistent with therapy) [4]. Studies in both the USA and Europe have shown that persistence with osteoporosis treatment is important for reducing the risk of fracture [5][6][7]. The data indicate that, compared with treatment lasting for less than 1-month, treatment must extend beyond 1 year in order to significantly reduce 3-year fracture incidence [6]. Evidence suggests, however, that approximately 50 % of women do not follow their prescribed osteoporosis treatment regimen and 50 % discontinue treatment within 1 year [8,9]. Hence, persistence is an important consideration in the overall management of patients with osteoporosis. Moreover, modelling studies have shown that the incorporation of persistence in health economic evaluations can have a considerable impact on the estimated cost-effectiveness of an intervention [10,11].",

Oral BPs can be administered daily, weekly, or monthly. An alternative treatment option is denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the RANK ligand, which is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection once every 6 months. Denosumab 60 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fracture, and for the treatment of bone loss associated with hormone ablation in men with prostate cancer at increased risk of fracture [13]. Denosumab 60 mg has also been shown to increase bone mass in women with bone loss associated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy [14].",

The most frequent reasons for exclusion were: not reporting an estimate of 12-or 24-month persistence; discussing only hormone replacement therapy, osteoporotic fractures, or calcium/vitamin D supplementation; not using retrospective data; not having been written in English; and being a review. Review articles were manually searched for any articles that had not been identified by the search of PubMed [22,28]. In total, 40 articles were included in the final review and meta-analysis (Table 3)  [5,6,. These included studies from 12 different countries, with the largest number of studies being conducted in the USA (17 studies) [5, 35-38, 41, 42, 46, 49-51, 54, 56, 59, 63, 64, 66] and the next largest number being conducted in the Netherlands (four studies) [43,44,48,61]. Two studies used the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register [6,47]. In the majority of studies, a patient was defined as non-persistent with treatment if the time period between two consecutive prescription fills exceeded the length of the permissible gap. The most commonly used permissible gap was 30 days [5, 30, 32-40, 44, 49, 52, 55, 56, 58, 61, 65]; other commonly used permissible gaps were 60 and 90 days. In nine studies [6, 31, 40-42, 45, 47, 64, 66], patients were allowed to accumulate medicine (i.e., use supply from a previous prescription) and in 16 studies [6, 30-32, 34, 39, 40, 44-46, 52, 54, 55, 57, 61, 63], they were allowed to switch between treatments during the study period (e.g., from alendronate to risedronate or from weekly to daily oral BPs). The studies varied in the type of data source used (e.g., claims, medical charts), type of patients included (e.g., women with PMO, treatment-na\u00efve women), and type of oral BP prescribed (e.g., alendronate, risedronate).",

Additionally, the majority of women in our study had previously received other anti-osteoporosis therapies; this is not surprising given that most women are prescribed oral BPs as their first line of treatment and subsequently switch to another treatment if they do not respond or experience intolerable side effects or dosing inconvenience. We estimated 12-and 24-month persistence with denosumab therapy to be 83 and 62 %, respectively, using a permissible gap of 56 days (8 weeks). The length of this gap is somewhat arbitrary and was chosen to be consistent with that used in previous studies of persistence using the same database [6,47]. Varying the permissible gap to 30, 90, and 180 days resulted in estimated persistence rates of 78, 84, and 87 %, respectively, at 12 months, indicating that the estimates were robust. Women who had received previous anti-osteoporosis therapies were more likely to persist with denosumab than treatment-na\u00efve women. One possible explanation for this finding is that treatment-experienced women are more informed about their disease and receive more information from their prescriber. Filling a prescription for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation in the first 6 months after initiating denosumab was significantly associated with persistence, with those who filled prescriptions having a higher persistence rate than those who did not. Similar results were reported by Cotte et al. [33], who found that the rate of persistence was higher in women taking calcium and vitamin D supplementation than in those who did not take such supplements. While the reason for this is not clear, a possible explanation is that calcium and vitamin D supplementation is an indicator of high risk and, therefore, high disease awareness. Finally, women receiving glucocorticoids before initiating denosumab had lower rates of persistence than those who had no experience of glucocorticoids. Similar results have been reported elsewhere for other anti-osteoporosis treatments [6,44,53], and further study is warranted to elucidate the reasons for the association between persistence and glucocorticoid use.

Data are given as percentage (95 % confidence interval. Citation numbers of the studies detailed in this figure are given in Table 3 Persistence with oral bisphosphonates The literature review identified 40 retrospective studies reporting at least one estimate of 12-or 24-month persistence with oral BPs, using varying methodologies. While all studies were similar in terms of how persistence was defined, they varied in the size of the permissible gap, which is directly related to the probability of being defined as non-persistent. Other study design heterogeneities concerned the possibility of a patient accumulating prescriptions or switching between dosages, dosing intervals, types of BP, and differences in study population. Less obvious differences, which were not systematically captured in our review, related to data quality and completeness, under-reporting by family physicians, and administrative hurdles. As well as methodological heterogeneity, the results are likely to have been influenced by other factors, such as types of healthcare organization, approaches to patient monitoring, drug reimbursement levels, and population disease awareness.",

It is worth noting that the estimate of 67 % was derived before the introduction of generic alendronate, which is likely to have caused a drop in persistence. These estimates for persistence with oral BP therapy are lower than the rates observed with denosumab using the same database. The permissible gap was identical to that in the present study (56 days); the only major difference was that patients were allowed to accumulate medicine in the studies of oral BPs.",

It is estimated that less than 10 % of sold denosumab doses have been administered in hospitals. By not including denosumab administered in hospitals, we may have not identified women who started treatment earlier than was recorded in the database and so we may have underestimated the true persistence rate; however, these women may be atypical and, to a large extent, may have been given denosumab for reasons related to cancer diagnoses. A register of prescriptions does not provide any assurance that the dose was actually taken; therefore, persistence with denosumab may have been overestimated in this study. Another limitation of retrospective data is that all variables of interest may not be available, and it was not possible in this database analysis to control for bone mineral density, concomitant medicine use, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and socioeconomic variables, all of which may be important predictors of persistence [57].",

Some persistence estimates may consequently have been derived from data of insufficient quality for a robust analysis. In addition, there was heterogeneity between the studies. With this in mind, the pooled estimates and the comparisons between the studies need to be interpreted with some caution. Moreover, the analysis did not consider persistence with other anti-osteoporosis drugs such as zoledronic acid and intravenous bisphosphonates. Persistence with these treatments, which are administered less frequently than oral BPs, has previously been shown to be higher than with oral BPs [62].",
