It is also a tool, which enables to examine and evaluate communication skills of employees in order to identify their weakness and define the way of improvement. The reason is that their applied abilities are connected with customer\u00b4s total perception of providing services. National post operators must learn to listen to their customers through their employees. This process is crucial for the market environment-it enables to gain customer\u00b4s loyalty and trust. In order to ensure higher level of customer oriented behaviour between the employees, Slovak Post starts a pilot project called \"Mystery Customer\". Main goal of the project is to analyze behaviour of selected post office personnel towards the mystery customer. The paper also deals with the practical use of mystery shopping in conditions of Slovak Post.",

A shopper would enter the banking establishment, make a cash deposit, and state that a receipt was not needed. Observations of how the transaction was processed or not processed were made. This type of assignment is called an integrity assignment and mainly deals with the potential act of theft. From this type of assignment, mystery shopping has developed into a rather large and unique industry covering areas from auto repair to fast food. In fact, some fast-food restaurants are mystery-shopped three times a day and shoppers are rotated (Newhouse 2004: 2). Mystery shopping got its start as a way to check on employee integrity and minimize theft primarily in the financial services industry. In the 1990's, fuelled by the internet, the mystery shopping industry experienced rapid growth and acceptance. Into the 2000's, the creation of software packages such as SASSIE and Prophet have revolutionized the industry (Michelson 1997(Michelson , 2004.",

The point is that the user of postal services should have good feeling by the entry to the post office and also by the exit. By providing of services the influence on the customer has a lot of effects. One of them is compliance of employees to show the interest about the customer\u00b4s needs and requirements. Important are also additional factors which affect the quality of providing services: employee behaviour, proficiency, service rate, work organization quality at the post office, arrangement and cleanness of interior, etc. Slovak Post continually educates employees not only in the proficiency, but also about the communication with the customers. Therefore Slovak Post, for the support of higher level of customer awareness between employees with the aim to verify the validity of employee training, began from the year 2000 to apply a pilot project called \"Mystery Customer\".The aim of the project is to find out the behaviour of counter employee of selected post office towards the mystery customer.
