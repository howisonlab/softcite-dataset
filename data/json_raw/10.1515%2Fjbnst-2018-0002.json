While administrative data can give exact accounts of welfare dynamics themselves, augmenting them with survey data can foster insights concerning the impact of more subjective measures (e.g. reservation wages) on these processes. The same is true for welfare dynamics with regard to household context. Apart from structural information like household composition, the survey data contain detailed accounts of the household situation, e.g. on material deprivation and child care arrangements. On the other hand enriching survey data with full administrative biographies enhances the validity of research into, for instance, the interplay of health and unemployment. Another important benefit of the administrative data is reliable longitudinal information on the earnings and benefit receipt of linked respondents.",

Several measures are collected in both the survey and the administrative data. This allows for analyses of, for instance, underreporting of welfare receipt (see Bruckmeier et al. 2014;Kreuter et al. 2010). Selection processes in the linkage procedure, which might influence the validity of results, can be analysed using characteristics of survey respondents (see Beste 2011).

The study's main focus is on topics related to pathways into and out of UB II receipt, the dynamics of the material and social situation of individuals and households as well as behaviour and attitudes of individuals over time. 3 PASS is an annual panel study that has been conducted by the IAB since 2006. Interviews are conducted on the household level as well as with every individual in the household aged 15 or older. Data collection is done using a sequential mixed mode design starting in a face to face mode (CAPI) and followed up by telephone (CATI) if the household or individual could not be contacted or prefers a telephone interview. Due to a large number of individuals with migration background in the sample, Turkish and Russian translations of the questionnaire were used if necessary.",

In all consecutive waves a refreshment sample was drawn from the UB II population in order to correct for changes in the composition of UB II recipients. In wave 5 (2011) an additional refreshment sample was drawn for both populations.

This might be especially problematic for topics that individuals are reluctant to report on as is the case for welfare receipt (see e.g., Bruckmeier et al. 2015). But even if respondents are willing to give proper answers, retrospective reporting of labour market histories is likely to produce errors, even more so as individuals get older and biographies increase in length and complexity.

In contrast, these characteristics have only statistical value when reported for employment relationships. Many employers therefore put in less effort in keeping such variables up to date compared to when reporting on, for instance, a person's wage sum during the year. The latter, on the other hand, is directly relevant for social security contributions and unemployment insurance entitlements.

During each of the linkage rounds, a so-called Goldstandard linkage was attempted for all consenters of the UB II sample. This linkage takes advantage of the fact that the UB II sample was drawn from the administrative data in the first place. For these cases, the linkage only had to identify members within a given benefit community (Bedarfsgemeinschaft), which only requires the name, sex and the birth date of a person.

In order to use the linked administrative data they have to be merged to the individual interviews from the PASS SUF prior to analysis. To do so, one merges records that belong to the same person identifier pnr, which is contained in the survey datasets as well as in the administrative individual file. This is also shown in the User Guide: the procedure applicable to administrative data is similar to using PASS's own biography dataset (Stata: ibid, Example 9.4; SPSS: Fuchs et al. 2015, Example 1.4).",
