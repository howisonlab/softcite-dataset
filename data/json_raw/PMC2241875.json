Multiexperiment analysis of aCGH data from tumors allows discovery of recurrent CNAs that are potentially causal to cancer development. Until now, multiexperiment aCGH data analysis has been dependent on discretization of measurement data to a gain, loss or no-change state. Valuable biological information is lost when a heterogeneous system such as a solid tumor is reduced to these states. We have developed a new approach which inputs nondiscretized aCGH data to identify regions that are significantly aberrant across an entire tumor set. Our method is based on kernel regression and accounts for the strength of a probe's signal, its local genomic environment and the signal distribution across multiple tumors. In an analysis of 89 human breast tumors, our method showed enrichment for known cancer genes in the detected regions and identified aberrations that are strongly associated with breast cancer subtypes and clinical parameters. Furthermore, we identified 18 recurrent aberrant regions in a new dataset of 19 p53-deficient mouse mammary tumors. These regions, combined with gene expression microarray data, point to known cancer genes and novel candidate cancer genes.",

DNA copy number alteration (CNA) is an important mechanism through which tumor cells can modulate expression of cancer genes. CNAs are a result of genomic instability, which has been described as an enabling mechanism of tumorigenesis (1). Aberrations range in size from relatively small regions (<0.5 Mb) to entire chromosomes and the various mechanisms by which they arise are unclear (2). Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a technique that is capable of measuring CNAs. The term CGH was first used for competitive hybridization of differentially labeled DNA on metaphase chromosomes (3) to measure CNAs.",

Most of the platforms sample the genome at specific positions with a certain distance between the measurement points (probes). This distance is referred to as the resolution of the platform.

Various automated methods have been described to analyze the results obtained from aCGH measurements. They typically either smooth the data and/or try to estimate the location of the aberration by defining 'break-points' at which the CNA is defined to start or end (12,13). This is always done at the single tumor level and procedures which define aberrations often rely on several parameter choices to find putative CNAs. It is not always clear how these parameters relate to biological reality. Recently, methods to discretize aCGH data have been extended to include states other than 1, 0 and \u00c01 (13)(14)(15). However, these methods do not provide a solid statistical framework to identify CNAs that occur in a significant fraction of the tumors. Especially these recurrent regions may harbor genes relevant for tumor development.",

Of these, STAC and H-HMM provide probabilistic outputs. Both STAC and CMAR suffer from the fact that aCGH data have to be discretized into three states (1, 0 and \u00c01) before the method can be applied. H-HMM uses continuous data as input, but still employs three discrete states in its hidden model. CNAs are discrete in nature on a single cell level, as gains and losses of a region of DNA can occur only on a per-copy basis. Although a method for single cell aCGH has recently been published (18), most aCGH analyses are not performed on single cells, but rather on a population of tumor cells mixed with stromal components. This stromal compartment will influence the signal measured by quenching the true CNA level. Moreover, as solid tumors are known to be heterogenic in nature and contain sub-populations of clonally diverse cells (19), it is also safe to assume that not all tumors cells will carry the same CNAs. This implies that an aCGH measurement will measure a population of CNAs present in the tumor sample. Apart from the fact that there is no consensus regarding the best discretization method to use, reducing a signal from such a heterogeneous population of CNAs to values of 1, 0 and \u00c01 leads to loss of potentially valuable biological information.",

To this end, we developed KC-SMART, Kernel Convolution: a Statistical Method for Aberrant Region deTection. This method employs kernel convolution (20) to perform locally weighted regression (21), which produces a smoothed estimate of the CNAs. This approach takes into account (i) the nondiscretized strength of a clone; (ii) the strength of neighboring clones in the same tumor, as well as (iii) the occurrence frequency of this clone across all tumors in the dataset. Kernel regression automatically corrects for the unequal distances between the probes. KC-SMART allows analysis of both small and large aberrations using different values for the width of the kernel function. This is important, as DNA copy number aberrations have a large variation in size (2). Using a published dataset of 89 sporadic breast tumors (22) we find that KC-SMART identifies several aberrations that correlate with breast cancer subtype and clinical parameters. We also identify regions that are enriched for known cancer genes.",

It is desirable to detect both large and small aberrations. Furthermore, the strength of gain or loss is an important factor, as high-level gains may reflect strong oncogene activation and high-level losses may reflect homozygous deletion of tumor suppressor genes. Different kernel widths must be used to find both very localized, high-level and low-level CNAs that span a large region. The width of the kernel function will determine how broad the region will be across which a probe amplitude will influence the KSE, i.e. how much the kernels will overlap. A narrow kernel can be expected to detect small local aberrations, which will be smoothed away by a wide kernel. Conversely, a wide kernel will identify long aberrations of low to medium strength such as a single copy loss or gain of a chromosome in a fraction of the tumor cells, while missing localized aberrations. By applying KC-SMART to a dataset using different kernel widths, we can construct a scale space of the dataset which gives a comprehensive view of the aberrations in the dataset. Another advantage of the scale-space analysis is that within a single aberration multiple levels of CNA may be present. Analyzing these aberrations using multiple scales can identify the region within an aberration that is significant across scales, and therefore more interesting. A visualization of how the scale space is constructed is depicted in Figure 1e.",

For each tumor in the 89 tumor dataset Chin et al. (22) determined the molecular subtype based on gene expression profiles. To determine which tumors contribute to a certain significant aberration, we ranked the tumors based on their average log2 value across all BAC clones in the aberrant region. Next, we calculated the cumulative contribution of the top n tumors to the total average log2 value in the aberrant region. The top n tumors, for which the cumulative contribution reached 75%, were marked as significantly contributing to that aberration. The threshold of 75% is chosen to be a conservative estimate, to ensure that all tumors truly contain this aberration. Among the tumors that contribute to a certain aberration we calculated the enrichment for each molecular subtype using the hypergeometric distribution. As can be seen in Tables 2 and 3, this analysis reveals significant association of several well-known aberrant regions with distinct molecular subtypes (22,31) and clinicopathological features.",

The loss on 9p is most common in normal-like tumors, which are associated with a genomically stable diploid genotype (33). This region contains the well-known tumor suppressor CDKN2A (p14 ARF ). CDKN2A gene expression was also found to significantly correlate with the 9p CNA profile, and can therefore be considered a putative driver gene for this location.

These data have been discretized with discretization algorithms, such as CBS (25) and MergeLevel (13). The results of our comparison are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows a genome-wide view of the frequency of alterations compared to the KC-SMART results for a single kernel width. Since most researchers use a frequency cutoff between 25 and 35% to define interesting regions (31,(34)(35)(36), we chose a cutoff of 30% to define significant regions in the frequency analysis. The right panel shows the result for chromosome 17. It can be seen that by employing a smaller kernel width, KC-SMART detects the ERBB2 amplification, which is not picked up by the frequency analysis. The overlap between the number of probes in the significant regions for KC-SMART (P < 0.05) and the number of probes in regions aberrated in !30% of the tumors is shown in Figure 4b. The Venn diagrams show that there is a large overlap in the copy number losses identified by both methods, but that the frequency method flags a larger number of probes as gained. To determine whether KC-SMART underestimates the number of significant regions or whether the frequency method overestimates the number of aberrated regions, we used the aCGH data to assess the 'quality' of the identified regions. More specifically, we computed, for each identified consecutive region, all the pair-wise correlation coefficients of clones within that region. Our hypothesis is that a higher degree of correlation will be indicative of a better delineation of the aberration. The smoothed histograms for both KC-SMART and the frequency approach are depicted in Figure 4c, As can be seen, the within-region correlation coefficients are, on average, much higher in the gained regions detected by KC-SMART than in the regions detected by the frequency approach. The frequency approach performs similar to KC-SMART when looking at the lost regions.",

            "text": "To our best knowledge, the only other readily available method that incorporates a statistical framework for multiexperiment aCGH analysis is STAC (17). This method employs two statistics, the frequency statistic and the footprint statistic, to identify aberrant regions. STAC requires aCGH data to be discretized to contain only 1 (gain), \u00c01 (loss) and 0 (no change). We analyzed the same 89-sample breast cancer dataset using STAC. Results are shown in the Supplementary Data. When comparing the regions found significant by both methods it is striking that STAC does not identify the 1q arm gain or the 17q ERBB2 amplification as significant. Significant regions found by STAC seem to aggregate at boundaries Table 3. Association of KC-SMART significant regions to the five breast cancer subtypes (30) For each clinical parameter the significantly associated aberrations are listed. Significance was determined using the hypergeometric distribution and corrected using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction8. Locations mentioned in the start and end column are accurate up to maximally 1 Mb, as this is the resolution of the array. \u00c3 The 5q loss associated with PR-negative staining was included as it was the most significant association with PR-negativity and only borderline not-significant. of chromosome arms. This could point to a bias in the algorithm for boundary regions. To investigate the nature of the significant regions detected by STAC but not by KC-SMART, we analyzed the raw log2 values and compared them to the discretized values produced by Chin et al. (22). Two examples of this analysis are shown in the Supplementary Data. Generally, the areas exclusively detected by STAC are scored as single copy alterations by the MergeLevels analysis done by Chin et al. (22). On a log2 scale these gains and losses were very small indeed ($0.1), but nevertheless large enough to be assigned a value of 1 or \u00c01, and are therefore treated equally to large gains and losses. This discrete approach, which neglects the amplitude of an aberration can therefore be considered to be less conservative than KC-SMART and can/may therefore yield more falsepositives.",

            "text": "To identify genes that are associated with CNA and potentially implicated in tumor formation we applied KC-SMART to a dataset containing aCGH measurements of 19 mammary carcinomas acquired from conditional p53 knockout mice. Sporadic mammary tumor development in these mice is induced by cell type-specific stochastic inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 (37). Mouse mammary tumors present with relatively few passenger mutations as compared to human sporadic tumors. This is because tumors from genetically engineered mouse models have a more uniform cell type of origin and they develop relatively rapid giving less time for passenger CNA development. This will aid in identification of causal aberrations and will reduce the number of tumors required for cancer gene discovery. Mouse aCGH data were preprocessed as described in the Methods section. The result of the analysis is shown in Figure 5. In total, seven amplified and 11 deleted regions were identified by KC-SMART. The significant CNAs identified by KC-SMART are large and contain many genes. Oncogenic aberrations typically occur because it is the mechanism through which an oncogene is amplified or a tumor suppressor is inactivated. We examined the gene expression profiles of all tumors to find the genes which are driving the aberrations. We used an in-house 32-k oligonucleotide microarray platform with 31 769 longmer probes targeting 19 104 unique genes, which is 68% of the known mouse protein-coding genes. By analyzing only the genes that are measured on the array, we accept the possibility of missing the driver gene because there is no corresponding probe on the array. Furthermore, the gene expression data were obtained using a pool of 12 mouse mammary tumor samples as a common reference. While these measurements will reveal the within-group variability of the tumor dataset, genes that are over-expressed or downregulated in all tumors will not be picked up, because their RNA levels in the reference pool are the same. The complete results of these analyses can be found in the Supplementary Data. As can be seen in Table 5 and Figure 6 the correlation analysis resulted in association of several known and novel cancer genes with significant recurrent CNAs. Our correlation analysis resulted in the association of three known cancer genes with gained regions (Ptpn11-Chr. 5, c-Met-Chr. 6 and Birc2-Chr. 9) and one known cancer gene within a deleted region (Cyld-Chr. 8). The mouse homologs from the CGC were used as 'known' cancer genes. The identification of known cancer genes validates this approach for cancer gene discovery.",

Tfdp1 is a transcription factor that operates in concert with the E2F family to upregulate genes associated with cell cycle progression (40). Cul4a is a ubiquitin ligase that targets the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 for degradation and thereby Cul4a activity promotes proliferation and cell cycle progression (41). Fboxo25 is a member of the F-box only protein family (42), which is well known for their ubiquitin-ligase function.  The positions mentioned are based on the maximal width of the aberration found across all scales. Genes that either have a start or end position in the region were taken into account.

The scale space of mouse chromosome 15 identifies a large region as significant in the large scales, yet only a small region remains significant in the smaller scales ( Figure 7a). If this region is analyzed in more detail (Figure 7b) one can see several genes situated next to the narrow significant region. The two genes that directly map onto the significant region are both predicted transcripts with unknown function. The Myc oncogene is situated slightly upstream from the significant region. If the heatmaps of the BAC clones are examined (Figure 7d) it is apparent that BAC Clone 7 shows a gain in multiple tumors. This could indicate that amplification of the region downstream of Myc has a tumorigenic effect, either by affecting Myc in some way or acting on a previously unknown gene. It could also mean that the chromosome 15 gain is not directed at the Myc oncogene, but rather at the Ddef1 gene. Ddef1 has been identified as a pathologically relevant target of amplification in human uveal melanoma (50). This result shows that scale-space analysis can be effectively used to gain more insight in complex aberrations and to identify potential target genes. Besides giving more insight in the nature of aberrations, the scale space is also used to identify both small focal aberrations and large low level CNAs such as chromosomal gains or losses. The smaller scales allow for identification of high-level amplifications, such as the ERBB2/HER2 amplification in human breast  Figure 6.

            "text": "Genomic instability is a powerful, yet chaotic way of acquiring aberrations that confer proliferative or survival advantages to a tumor cell. Correctly separating driver mutations from passenger mutations in aneuploid tumors is very difficult. The classical tumor model assumes clonal expansion of a tumor from a single progenitor cell; however, recent views on tumor development preferentially model the tumor as an ecological model, with different populations of tumor cell clones competing for survival (19). In such a diverse population of tumor cells, CNA should also be diverse. As an aCGH measurement is an averaged view of all CNAs within a large heterogenic population of tumor cells, discretization of these values to integer levels of copy number change may result in loss of information, which is exemplified by the fact that the level of ERBB2 amplification is a determinant of breast cancer progression (51). KC-SMART is the first method to use nondiscretized data to find statistically significant recurrent CNAs. KC-SMART uses the log2 values straight from the aCGH platform and is therefore not dependent on preprocessing steps, except for datanormalization. We show that relevant biological data are contained in the continuous log2 aCGH measurements. So, instead of noise reduction, discretization may well cause information loss. We think that approaches that discretize the aCGH data prior to detecting CNAs are likely to perform very well in clonal systems, such as cell lines and hematological tumors. KC-SMART is preferable for analysis of aCGH data from more heterogeneous solid tumor samples. Tumor tissues are challenging biological samples and their copy number analysis is confounded by several factors. Stromal contamination will quench the signal by introducing normal 2n DNA in the sample. Very pure (clonal) tumors will have a larger effect on the analysis as their overall measured copy number levels are higher. Both discretization approaches and KC-SMART will be affected by sample inhomogeneity. While KC-SMART will employ the measured aberration level in the analysis, discretization approaches will, depending on the chosen discretization threshold, either fully count an aberration (regardless of the degree to which it exceeds the threshold) or completely discard a probe when the CNA signal does not exceed the threshold defining an aberration. Very large focal amplifications will be maintained in the KC-SMART analysis, but if a sufficiently large set of tumors is analyzed, these aberrations will not be flagged as significant, unless they appear with sufficient frequency.",

Especially formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples are known to produce noisy measurements, making aCGH data from these samples hard to analyze. Since KC-SMART analyzes gains and losses separately, the possibility exists that noise which randomly fluctuates around zero will be detected as aberrations due to the separation of data in positive and negative values. However, this is countered in the random permutation scheme where all values including random fluctuations are incorporated in the construction of the background distribution. By determining a nulldistribution for each dataset analyzed, noise specific to that dataset is modeled and therefore also controlled. To gain the most power from an analysis we encourage researchers to keep comparable noise levels across the entire dataset.",

Identification of the previously reported 16p and 5q regions show that known relations are recapitulated by KC-SMART, and that these regions might be markers for the Luminal A and basal-like breast cancer subtypes, respectively. The 5q loss is an important feature employed in a classifier to separate BRCA1-mutated breast cancers from control tumors (52). BRCA1-mutated breast tumors are known to be generally basal-like (53), and the fact that aberrations on chromosome 5q can distinguish the BRCA1 tumors from control tumors is possibly due to their basal-like character. A BRCA1-modifier locus for hereditary breast cancer has been mapped to 5q (54) and multiple DNA-damage repair and cell cycle associated genes are present in the 5q region (e.g. RAD50, RAD17, APC). This finding might point to a more general DNA damage-related phenotype in basal breast tumors. Other relations with regions identified by KC-SMART are new, such as the association of 9p loss with normallike tumors, which could target the well-known INK4a/ ARF tumor suppressor locus located on 9p21. In a large clinical study, normal-like tumors were found to be mainly diploid, genomically stable tumors (33). In line with this, mouse mesotheliomas induced by Nf2 and Ink4a/Arf loss show significantly less genomic instability than mouse mesotheliomas induced by Nf2 and p53 loss (van Montfort,E. and Berns,A., unpublished data). Normal-like tumors may thus be driven by INK4a-ARF loss-of-function.",

This could point to the fact that a tumor cell might be more inclined to use epigenetic factors to downregulate tumor suppressor genes so that the correlation between expression and copy number values would be disturbed. It could also mean that a deletion is more suited to incur haploinsuffiency of large numbers of genes, which may collectively contribute to tumor development (58). In contrast, amplification is more likely to result in overexpression of one or a few genes which are therefore more likely to be detected by correlation analysis.",

KC-SMART provides the researcher with a solid statistical analysis, while frequency-based thresholds will be arbitrarily chosen.

Results for both the statistics (footprint and frequency) can be very different. This disparity complicated the interpretation and might lead to results-oriented use of statistics. Furthermore, STAC bases the background-distribution of their statistical tests on local chromosome-arm permutation. This means that recurrent loss or gain of whole-chromosome arms cannot be detected. A prime example of this is the well-known gain of human 1q which was not identified as statistically significant by STAC. Also, basing the background distribution just on the chromosome arm is not a correct representation of the biological reality, where the exact position of a gain or amplification is not known and could be located on a completely different chromosome arm.
