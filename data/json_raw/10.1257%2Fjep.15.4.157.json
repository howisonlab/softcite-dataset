This is a natural choice, because applied econometricians are typically called upon to determine how much one variable will change in response to a change in some other variable. Increasingly however, econometricians are being asked to forecast and analyze the size of the errors of the model. In this case, the questions are about volatility, and the standard tools have become the ARCH/ GARCH models. The basic version of the least squares model assumes that the expected value of all error terms, when squared, is the same at any given point. This assumption is called homoskedasticity, and it is this assumption that is the focus of ARCH/ GARCH models. Data in which the variances of the error terms are not equal, in which the error terms may reasonably be expected to be larger for some points or ranges of the data than for others, are said to suffer from heteroskedasticity. The standard warning is that in the presence of heteroskedasticity, the regression coefficients for an ordinary least squares regression are still unbiased, but the standard errors and confidence intervals estimated by conventional procedures will be too narrow, giving a false sense of precision. Instead of considering this as a problem to be corrected, ARCH and GARCH models treat heteroskedasticity as a variance to be modeled. As a result, not only are the deficiencies of least squares corrected, but a prediction is computed for the variance of each error term. This prediction turns out often to be of interest, particularly in applications in finance. The warnings about heteroskedasticity have usually been applied only to cross-section models, not to time series models. For example, if one looked at the",

In a cross-section regression of household consumption on income, the error terms seem likely to be systematically larger in absolute value for high-income than for low-income households, and the assumption of homoskedasticity seems implausible. In contrast, if one looked at an aggregate time series consumption function, comparing national income to consumption, it seems more plausible to assume that the variance of the error terms doesn't change much over time.",

            "text": "However, sometimes the natural question facing the applied econometrician is the accuracy of the predictions of the model. In this case, the key issue is the variance of the error terms and what makes them large. This question often arises in financial applications where the dependent variable is the return on an asset or portfolio and the variance of the return represents the risk level of those returns. These are time series applications, but it is nonetheless likely that heteroskedasticity is an issue. Even a cursory look at financial data suggests that some time periods are riskier than others; that is, the expected value of the magnitude of error terms at some times is greater than at others. Moreover, these risky times are not scattered randomly across quarterly or annual data. Instead, there is a degree of autocorrelation in the riskiness of financial returns. Financial analysts, looking at plots of daily returns such as in Figure 1, notice that the amplitude of the returns varies over time and describe this as \"volatility clustering.\" The ARCH and GARCH models, which stand for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, are designed to deal with just this set of issues. They have become widespread tools for dealing with time series heteroskedastic models. The goal of such models is to provide a volatility measure-like a standard deviation-that can be used in financial decisions concerning risk analysis, portfolio selection and derivative pricing.",

While many specifications have been considered for the mean return and have been used in efforts to forecast future returns, virtually no methods were available for the variance before the introduction of ARCH models. The primary descriptive tool was the rolling standard deviation. This is the standard deviation calculated using a fixed number of the most recent observations. For example, this could be calculated every day using the most recent month (22 business days) of data. It is convenient to think of this formulation as the first ARCH model; it assumes that the variance of tomorrow's return is an equally weighted average of the squared residuals from the last 22 days. The assumption of equal weights seems unattractive, as one would think that the more recent events would be more relevant and therefore should have higher weights. Furthermore the assumption of zero weights for observations more than one month old is also unattractive. The ARCH model proposed by Engle (1982) let these weights be parameters to be estimated. Thus, the model allowed the data to determine the best weights to use in forecasting the variance.",

The most widely used GARCH specification asserts that the best predictor of the variance in the next period is a weighted average of the long-run average variance, the variance Figure 1 Nasdaq, Dow Jones and Bond Returns predicted for this period, and the new information in this period that is captured by the most recent squared residual.

The biggest hit was $67,000 on April 14. We all know that Nasdaq declined substantially over the next year. The Dow Jones average was much less affected, and bond prices increased as the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates. Figure 2 plots the value at risk estimated each day using this methodology within the sample period and the losses that occurred the next day. There are about 1 percent of times the value at risk is exceeded, as is expected, since this is in-sample. Figure 3 plots the same graph for the next year and a quarter, during which the equity market tanks and the bond yields fall. The parameters are not reestimated, but the formula is simply updated each day. The computed value at risk rises substantially from the $40,000 initial figure as the volatility rises in April 2000. Then the losses decline, so that the value at risk is well above the realized losses. Toward the end of the period, the losses approach the value at risk again, but at a lower level. In this year and a quarter, the value at risk is exceeded only once; thus, this is actually a slightly conservative estimate of the risk. It is not easy to determine whether a particular value-at-risk number is correct, although statistical tests can be formulated for this in the same way they are formulated for volatilities. For example, Engle and Manganelli (2001) present a \"dynamic quantile test.\" ",

While time series structure is valuable for forecasting, it does not satisfy our need to explain volatility. The estimation strategy introduced for ARCH/GARCH models can be directly applied if there are predetermined or exogenous variables. Thus, we can think of the estimation problem for the variance just as we do for the mean. We can carry out specification searches and hypothesis tests to find the best formulation. Thus far, attempts to find the ultimate cause of volatility are not very satisfactory. Obviously, volatility is a response to news, which must be a surprise. However, the timing of the news may not be a surprise and gives rise to predictable components of volatility, such as economic announcements. It is also possible to see how the amplitude of news events is influenced by other news events. For example, the amplitude of return movements on the United States stock market may respond to the volatility observed earlier in the day in Asian markets as well as to the volatility observed in the United States on the previous day. Engle, Ito and Lin (1990) call these \"heat wave\" and \"meteor shower\" effects.",

In particular, the volatility of an individual stock is clearly influenced by the volatility of the market as a whole. This is a natural implication of the capital asset pricing model. It also appears that there is time variation in idiosyncratic volatility (for example, Engle, Ng and Rothschild, 1992). This discussion opens the door to multivariate modeling where not only the volatilities but also the correlations are to be investigated. There are now a large number of multivariate ARCH models to choose from. These turn out often to be difficult to estimate and to have large numbers of parameters. Research is continuing to examine new classes of multivariate models that are more convenient for fitting large covariance matrices. This is relevant for systems of equations such as vector autoregressions and for portfolio problems where possibly thousands of assets are to be analyzed.",

This paper has presented an example of risk measurement that could be the input to a variety of economic decisions. The analysis of ARCH and GARCH models and their many extensions provides a statistical stage on which many theories of asset pricing and portfolio analysis can be exhibited and tested.",
