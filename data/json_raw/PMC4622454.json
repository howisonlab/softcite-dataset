Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to explore the sleep characteristics in individuals with chronic stroke compared to age-and sex-matched controls. Sixteen individuals with chronic stroke and ten age-and sex-matched controls underwent two nights of polysomnographic recording. The sleep characteristics of interest included total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and percent time, as well as time in minutes spent in stages N1, N2, and N3 and stage R sleep. The individuals with chronic stroke spent less percent time in stage N3 compared with controls (P=0.048). No significant differences in the other sleep characteristics were found between the stroke and control groups. Individuals with chronic stroke present with altered stage N3 sleep compared with healthy controls. These alterations in stage N3 sleep might be a sign of neuronal dysfunction and may impact recovery following stroke. A larger scale study is needed to confirm these findings.",

            "text": "Individuals after stroke often experience sleep disturbances and changes in sleep patterns. Up to 40% of individuals with chronic stroke (defined as .6 months following stroke) and 70% of those with acute stroke have sleep-wake disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness, insomnia, hypersomnia, and fatigue. 1 Sleep-related breathing disturbances are also common, affecting up to 70% of individuals with stroke, 2 with obstructive sleep apnea being the most common form. 2 Sleep-related movement disorders like restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movements, as well as stage R (formally referred to as rapid eye movement [REM]) sleep behavior disorder are also common in individuals with stroke. 3 Sleep disturbances following stroke can lead to short-term and long-term negative patient outcomes 4 and increase the risk of a recurrent stroke. 5 Medication use, sleep-disordered breathing, depression, pain, impaired mobility, and other complications from the stroke are factors that contribute to compromised sleep in people following stroke. 6 Furthermore, the area of the brain affected by the stroke can play an important role in determining the spectrum of sleep disturbances that occur. 6 In addition, untreated sleep disturbances after stroke, like sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness, increase the risk of developing another stroke. 7 Sleep has been shown to enhance learning motor skills and memory consolidation in individuals with chronic stroke. 8 Sleep is classified into two main stages: 9 non-REM sleep (stage N) or REM (stage R) sleep. Stage N sleep is divided into three substages corresponding to increasing depth of sleep as shown using electroencephalograms (EEGs): N1 involves the transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by sinusoidal alpha wave activity, N2 is characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes (clusters of low-and high-amplitude waves, respectively), and N3 or slow-wave sleep is characterized by slow delta waves. Stage R sleep is characterized by REMs and muscle atonia.",

First, only four of the 12 PSG studies included healthy participants as their control group; 19,22,23 the remaining used hospitalized patients 17,18,25 or other patients with neurologic disease. 20,21,27 Neurologically intact, sex-and aged-matched controls would be an ideal comparison to reduce the impact of medications or comorbidities that might impact sleep characteristics, thus making conclusions difficult. In addition, most of the PSG studies focus on individuals with acute stroke 11,20,21,25 or included individuals with a diverse range of chronicity ranging from acute, subacute, to chronic stages. 18,22 Therefore, evidence of sleep characteristics in individuals with chronic stroke of greater than 6 months is lacking. Understanding the sleep characteristics of individuals with chronic stroke is especially critical because approximately 6.8 million Americans are living with chronic stroke, 29 and up to 50% of those with chronic stroke report having sleep disturbances. 31 Another difficulty in interpreting the findings of prior studies is the majority were conducted on a single night. [18][19][20][22][23][24][26][27][28]32 Two nights of PSG recording is recommended, where the first night is referred to as the \"adaptation\" or \"acclimation\" night and is disregarded from analysis and considered not representative of the usual sleeping patterns. 33 Only two studies conducted PSG on two to three consecutive nights, but their target population was individuals with acute stroke. 19,27 To our knowledge, there are no studies that have assessed the sleep characteristics of individuals with chronic stroke using a healthy sex-and age-matched control group for comparison and using an acclimation night.",

Physiological signals were recorded using Nihon Kohden equipment (Foothill Ranch, CA, USA). Other instruments included a nasal airflow sensor, comfortable belts around the thorax and abdomen to monitor respiratory effort, a finger probe to assess pulse oximetry, and a microphone to monitor snoring. Each study session was digitally video recorded. The sleep records were scored according to standardized scoring criteria. 36 The outcome measures of interest are as follows: TST, SE, time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R, and percent sleep period time spent in stage N1, stage N2, stage N3, and stage R. For data analysis, SPSS version 20.0 was used to perform all statistical analysis, and alpha was set at 0.05. Descriptive statistics were calculated. The data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Skewness and Kurtosis test, as well as Box plots and normal Q-Q plots. Independent t-tests were used to compare the sleep parameters of the individuals with stroke with the control participants when the assumption of normality was satisfied. Effect sizes were calculated as Cohen's d values. Because this is a pilot study, data are presented without correction for multiplicity. Due to the sex difference in the stroke sample, linear regression was used to study if sex predicts the outcome measure of interest after controlling for age which can be a confounding factor for change in sleep parameters. An exploratory analysis was performed using independent t-tests to compare the sleep characteristics and descriptive characteristics of individuals with left-sided MCA lesions (n=7) to those with right-sided MCA lesions (n=9).

Also, individuals with chronic  MCA stroke spent less time in stage N1 and stage R, while spending more time in stage N2 compared with the control participants, although these differences were not statistically different. While this is the first study that has examined the sleep characteristics of individuals with chronic stroke, the results of this study mirror the results of the study of individuals with acute stroke, in which it was found that individuals with acute stroke spend less time in stage N3 sleep. 20,24,38 A recent study 39 that investigated changes in the topographic sleep of EEG in acute and chronic (defined as 3 months for their study) stroke participants suggests that higher slow-wave activity during sleep reflects cortical plasticity and could be used as a predictive measure of recovery of patients with stroke. Furthermore, it has been found that higher slow-wave activity during sleep is associated with improved performance on a motor learning task in healthy individuals. 40 Huber et al 41 also suggest that a decrease in slow-wave activity during sleep might be due to inactivity of the extremity and the resultant lack of input to the contralateral cortex. The latter might explain in part the low percentage of time spent in stage N3 in the stroke sample of the current study.",

This finding is clinically important as altered changes in neuroplasticity and in normal sleep homeostasis may negatively affect functional recovery and motor learning of individuals with chronic stroke. To explore the association between N3 and functional abilities, a post hoc analysis was done using Pearson's correlations. However, no significant relationship was found between time spent in stage N3 and the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (r=0.001, P=0.998) or the Orpington Prognostic Score (r=0.143, P=0.599). The low sample size of the current study might explain the lack of association between function and stage N3 in the stroke participants. In addition, the Cohen's d value showed a small effect size of percent of time in stage N3 (-0.3), which might be influenced by the low sample size as well. Future studies should investigate these findings and explore more thoroughly if the reduction in time spent in stage N3 has negative functional outcomes in individuals with chronic stroke.",

Evidence from previous research 39 found a decrease in slow-wave sleep in individuals with stroke correlated with higher stroke severity. However, it should be noted that the individuals in the current study would be considered to have mild strokes, 37 so it would be unlikely that the decrease in time spent in N3 would be due to stroke severity. Furthermore, because exact lesion location is unknown (ie, cortical vs subcortical), it is difficult to interpret this finding. If other studies confirm these results that the difference in stage N3 sleep is due to the location of a lesion, this information could guide clinicians and sleep specialists to more accurately predict the possible sleep quality disturbances in relation to lesion side in individuals with stroke. Future studies should further investigate this finding in individuals with chronic stroke and examine anatomical lesion location in more detail.",

This is further supported by the average Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for both the stroke and control participants having a global score below 5, which indicates good sleep quality. 43 Because individuals were excluded if an untreated sleep disorder was identified during the acclimation night and if they have uncontrolled depression, the individuals in this study likely have better sleep quality than the general stroke population, which does limit the generalizability of the findings of this study.",

            "text": "There are several limitations in this pilot study. One limitation is exact location of the lesion is not known, so it was not possible to consider the location of the lesion in the interpretation of the data. Another limitation is the heterogeneity in age among the study participants in both groups, which limits data interpretation but improves generalizability. Furthermore, there is no consensus for reporting the time spent in the different sleep stages in percent time or in minutes. In this study, both were reported, but this lack of consensus need to be addressed to improve comparison between studies. Medication use, particularly sleep-related medications, could be a confounding factor affecting interpretation and should be considered in future studies. In addition, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution due to the low sample size and lack of correcting for multiplicity due to this being a pilot study. A larger scale study is needed to verify the findings of this pilot study.",

It appears that alterations in the sleep parameters remain even more than 6 months following a stroke, particularly changes to stage N3 sleep. However, further large-scale studies are needed to verify if less time spent in stage N3 is associated with poor motor function or if more time spent in stage N2 is associated with improved motor function and recovery in individuals with chronic stroke.",
