            "text": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and tolerability of multiple doses of inhaled loxapine aerosol in subjects on a stable, oral, chronic antipsychotic regimen. Loxapine was delivered by means of a unique thermally generated aerosol comprising drug particles of a size designed for deep lung delivery and absorption. Thirty-two subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive inhaled loxapine (total doses of 15, 20, or 30 mg) or inhaled placebo administered in 3 divided doses, given 4 hours apart. Following inhalation, the median T max was 2 minutes, and concentrations declined to about half C max approximately 5 minutes later across the 3 dose levels. The dose proportionality across data from this study combined with data from the single-dose study showed a slope (90%CI) of log AUC inf versus log dose of 0.818 (0.762-0.875) across the 8 doses (n \u00bc 60 subjects) studied, indicating reasonable dose proportionality. The most common adverse events were cough (3 of 32, 9%), sedation (3 of 32, 9%), and dysgeusia (2 of 32, 6%). The inhalation of multiple doses of inhaled loxapine were well tolerated in study subjects and provided a safe, well-tolerated means for rapidly and reliably achieving therapeutic plasma concentrations of loxapine.

            "text": "Acute agitation is a serious complication of many chronic mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, 1 bipolar disorder, 2 and dementia. 3 Broadly defined as a state of motor restlessness associated with mental tension, agitation may include hand-wringing, fist clenching, pacing, pressured speech, yelling, or threatening other persons. 4 Acute agitation associated with psychiatric diseases often results in severe distress to patients and their caregivers and is a major contributor to the ongoing stigmatization of mental illness. 5 Oral loxapine, introduced more than 35 years ago in the United States, Canada, and Europe, has a well-established efficacy and safety profile in the treatment ofschizophrenia, 6,7 and an intramuscular formulation was previously approved for the treatment of agitation. [8][9][10][11] Its antipsychotic effects are similar to those of other antipsychotics such as haloperidol and are likely attributable to its actionat dopamine D2 receptors. 1 Loxapine shares some of its clinical effects with atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine and olanzapine, 12 likely because of its antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors. Oral loxapine is used for the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States. The intramuscular form of loxapine is no longer marketed in the United States, but is frequently used in France for the acute treatment of agitation. 13 Intramuscular antipsychotics have a T max of 90 minutes and can take up to 60 minutes to reduce agitation, [14][15][16][17] and symptoms can escalate during this period. Moreover, intramuscular administration is often resisted by patients. To address these concerns, an inhaled formulation of loxapine has been developed that has a T max of 2 minutes and has been shown in clinical trials to begin controlling agitation of patients with schizophrenia 18 or bipolar I disorder 19 within 10 minutes. This inhaled loxapine formulation (ADA-SUVE) uses breath-actuated delivery, the Staccato system, which delivers loxapine with a pharmacokinetic profile comparable to that of intravenous administration, providing peak plasma levels in systemic circulation within minutes after administration. 20 ADASUVE was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for a single dose and by the European Medicines Association in 2013 for 2 doses. In the United States, it is \"indicated for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults.\" ADASUVE became commercially available in the European Union in 2013 and in the United States in 2014.",

Tubes were gently inverted 8 to 10 times and placed on ice, centrifuged (within 30 minutes) for 15 minutes (1000g) at 4\u00b0C-10\u00b0C, plasma was split into 2 equal volume samples (set A and set B) and stored upright at \u00c070\u00b0C or below for storage. Set A was sent to the analytical laboratory, and set B was retained at the study site until the end of the study. Plasma loxapine, 7-OHloxapine, 8-OH-loxapine, and amoxapine concentrations were measured using a validated method by Tandem Labs (Salt Lake City, UT). Analytical quality controls (QCs) at the low (0.150 ng/mL), medium (20.0 ng/mL), and high (40.0 ng/mL) levels were assayed in duplicate in each analytical run. For each dilution level, dilution QCs (200 ng/mL, df \u00bc 10) were run in triplicate in any analytical run that contained diluted subject samples. Each internal standard (loxapine-d8, amoxapine-d8, 7-hydroxyloxapine-d8, and 8-hydroxyloxapine-d8) was added to all samples (except blanks). Calibration standards had to be within AE 15% of target (AE 20% for the method lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) to be acceptable. The samples were prepared by a solidphase extraction procedure and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The API 5000 was operated in the selected reaction monitoring mode under optimized conditions for detection of loxapine, amoxapine, 7-OH-loxapine, and 8-OH-loxapine, as well as the internal standards loxapine-d8, amoxapine-d8, 7-OH-loxapine-d8 and 8-OH-loxapine-d8 positive ions formed by electrospray ionization.

Plasma concentrations of loxapine by dose regimen, first 12 h. Mean AE 1 SD by dose group, all PK subjects (N \u00bc 24). patients and staff in the treatment setting. Currently available treatments for acute agitation include oral or intramuscular formulations of conventional and atypical antipsychotics, often used in combination with a benzodiazepine. [24][25][26] ADASUVE was the first inhaled product for the acute treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and has demonstrated onset of an antiagitation effect in 10 minutes. 18,19 Loxapine aerosol for inhalation thus appears to offer a number of benefits compared with currently available oral and intramuscular treatments for acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia, both in terms of speed of onset and acceptability to patients, who are often reluctant to accept an injection. 10 Oral administration of a single 25-mg dose of loxapine resulted in a mean C max of 20 ng/mL after approximately 2 hours, 27 whereas oral administration of a 50-mg dose of loxapine resulted in a mean C max of 33 ng/mL after approximately 1.5 hours. 28 Intramuscular administration of 20 mg of loxapine resulted in a C max of 17.8 ng/mL after approximately 1 hour. 29 By comparison, inhalation of 5 or 10 mg (normalized to10 mg loxapine) produced a mean C max of 69.3 ng/mL at a median time of 2 minutes (Table 2) following inhalation, so that clinical effects would be expected to occur very quickly. The <8% difference between the 4-and 2-hour concentrations in this study (Table 2) supports the administration of a second dose 2 hours after the first dose. Onset of a statistically significant reduction in agitation at 5 minutes has been demonstrated with this formulation in agitated patients with schizophrenia 18 and bipolar disease. 19 The lungs contain most of the same drug-metabolizing enzymes found in the liver. 30 However, based on the loxapine levels achieved in this study, loxapine does not appear to be extensively metabolized in the lung. Although the peak plasma concentrations immediately following inhalation are higher than for oral loxapine, the concentration of loxapine and its metabolites after the distribution phase were similar to those reported following oral administration. 27,31,32 We were able to locate 12 articles that reported measured loxapine blood concentrations. Only Midha et al 28 reported a loxapine half-life or AUC measured over 100 hours after an oral dose. They reported a halflife mean (CV%) of 7.6 hours (121%) compared with 6.2 hours (27%) in our single-dose study and 7.1 hours (27%) in the present study. They likewise reported a dose-normalized (per milligram) AUC inf of 3.4 ng \u00c1 h/mL (59%) compared with 17.8 ng \u00c1 h/mL (27%) and 11.4 ng \u00c1 h/mL (50%) in the present study. Thus, both AUC and half-life following inhaled administration exhibited less (or similar) variability compared with oral administration.",

Among the 11 quantitative safety measures studied, none showed clinically important dose-related changes, even though the prescribing information for loxapine lists possible cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope.",

Following inhalation, loxapine was rapidly absorbed and rapidly distributed and exhibited minimal accumulation during a 3-dose regimen with a 4-hour dosing interval. Relative to C max , there were small differences in loxapine concentration between 2 and 4 hours after dosing, supporting the administration of a second dose 2 hours after the first dose with an expected minimal increase in C max . The results of this multidose study support repeat dosing of inhaled loxapine after an interval of 2 to 4 hours."
