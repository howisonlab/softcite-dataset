            "text": "Partial-thickness burns (PTBs) are burn wounds commonly seen in emergency rooms. PTBs are characterised as blister, swelling and redness on the skin. These skin damages affect the epidermis and structures beneath the epidermis such as blood vessels, hair follicles and nerves. 1 PTB is usually categorised as superficial PTB or deep PTB. Superficial PTBs involve damage to the papillary dermis, characterised as intact blisters, moderate oedema, a moist surface under the blisters, a bright pink or red colour. Deep PTBs involve damage to both the papillary and reticular dermis, characterised as broken blisters, substantial oedema, a wet surface, waxy white colour. 2 The difference between superficial and deep PTB is whether the burns extend through all skin layers, and deep PTBs do. In the USA alone, there are 486 000 burn injuries (43% caused by fire or flame, 34% by scald, 9% by contact, 4% by electrical burns, 3% by chemical burns and Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa The comparative effectiveness of different wound dressings in the management of partial-thickness burn has not been studied; our network meta-analysis will be the first to answer the question. \u25aa We will conduct this network meta-analysis in a Bayesian framework and test robustness of the result with multiple meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses. \u25aa We will include trials assessing the effectiveness of traditional wound dressings that were treated as standard wound care. These trials are usually published before the year 2000, the quality of which may be generally low.",

Healthcare costs for burns are high; a median cost of $44 024 is needed for one patient. 5 Although direct data on cost for PTB are not available, they were assumed to be costly. 6 Therefore, efficient and effective wound care for PTB management is urgently needed. PTB management consists of wound preparation, wound cover and postwound care. 7 Wound dressings, covering the wound to accelerate wound healing and protect the wound from infection, include modern dressings like hydrocolloids, hydrofibre, silicones, alginates and polyurethane and traditional dressings like paraffin gauze and silver sulfadiazine (SSD).",

Silver SSD, one of the traditional dressings, has been reported as the gold standard for PTB management. 9 However, SSD is under criticism for causing wounds to dry up and not supporting optimal healing. 10 Unlike SSD, modern dressings have the advantages of keeping a moist environment around burn wounds and effectively protecting the wound from exposure to pathogenic bacterium. 8 Each of these modern dressings has its own features in achieving optimal healing. For example, hydrocolloids, one of the modern dressings, contain gelatin, pectin and sodium carboxymethylcellulose in an adhesive polymer matrix. When the polymer matrix of the hydrocolloid dressings contacting wound exudate would form a gel, so they facilitate autolytic debridement of wounds. 11 Polyurethane films are adhesive-coated sheets applied directly to burn wounds. The advantage of polyurethane lies in that it is permeable to water vapour, oxygen and carbon dioxide but not to water or pathogenic bacterium. However, polyurethane is not suitable for wounds with heavy exudate. 12 The other modern dressings have their own advantages, which leave the physicians and patient with a selection dilemma.",

Therefore, questions are raised: Which are the best wound dressings in achieving rapid healing, in relieving pain, in retaining optimal functional ability or in leaving minimal scars? To answer these questions, we need results from pairwise comparisons of different wound dressings, so a network meta-analysis is warranted. The network meta-analysis combines direct (head-to-head comparisons of different dressings) and indirect (we could simulate dressing A vs B if they share the same comparator C) evidence. 13 The analysis is usually done with the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, since it has multiple advantages, such as producing results for all comparisons of interest within a connected network, calculating the probability that each drug is the best treatment and adjusting for correlations within multiarm trials. 14 In summary, we will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to study the comparative effectiveness of different wound dressings in the management of PTB, providing a reference basis for decision-making.",

Patients with burns that are dry, painless, grey, white or brownish will be excluded, for these burns may be full-thickness burns. We will also include patients with burns classified as grade II burns, which used to be another name of PTB. 17 We will include both paediatric and adult patients who receive treatments in primary, secondary or tertiary care settings. Patients who need referral to wound-care specialists will be excluded, since using wound dressings alone plays a little role in the treatments for these patients. Additionally, we will include patients with fresh PTBs (within 72 hours after injury), since PTBs beyond 72 hours may be infected and thus need special wound care in addition to wound dressings. Adolescents (age under 18 years) or elders (aged over 65 years) with the size of the burn area surpassing 10% of the total body surface area (TBSA) or adults (aged between 18 and 65 years) with the size surpassing 15% of TBSA will be excluded, since these patients also need special wound care managed by specialists. 7 18 19 Patients with burns caused by electric or chemistry or with burns located on the face, neck, hands, feet, armpits, popliteal region or genitals will be excluded, since these burns need special wound care in addition to local wound dressings. 7 20 21 Concomitant diseases in the endocrine and immune systems (eg, diabetes) should be reported in RCTs recruiting patients aged over 50 years; otherwise, these RCTs will be excluded. Diseases in these two systems will influence time to heal PTB. 22 Types of interventions Both traditional and modern wound dressings will be assessed in this review. Traditional wound dressings refer to paraffin gauze and silver SSD, which are used less often now, because they may cause wounds to dry up and lead to increased risk of infection. 7 9 23 However, since they have been conventionally used as standard wound care in the past 30 years, 24 we will include them as reference comparators. Modern wound dressings, such as hydrocolloid, hydrogel, hydrofibre, silicones, bioengineered skin substitutes, alginates and polyurethane, will be included for assessment. These modern dressings, compared with traditional dressings, have several advantages of keeping a moist wound environment to facilitate healing, providing an effective barrier to reduce the risk of infection and maintaining maximum contact with the wound to relieve pain. 25 Additionally, they are easy to use and remove, which guarantees a minimal extent of pain during attaching or removing dressings.

A comprehensive search strategy has been developed (table 1). We will also search clinicaltrials.gov for RCTs that were registered but not reported (from inception to 2016), and we will contact the sponsors or principal investigators of these trials to ask for data. Besides, we will contact the experts in the field and review the conference proceedings to locate non-published studies. The reference lists of articles will be reviewed for any candidate studies. Identification of studies Two reviewers (QJ and S-BW) will independently screen titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles for eligible RCTs. If it is impossible to determine the eligibility of the eligible RCTs through titles and abstracts, we will obtain full-text copies for further evaluation. Disagreement on eligibility of a RCT will be solved by group discussion and arbitrated by a third reviewer (X-DC).",

We will use this assessment tool to determine internal validity of the RCTs in six domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other issues. In assessing other issues, we will focus on baseline imbalance and source of financial support. The baseline imbalance may cause overestimation or underestimation of an experimental intervention. 26 Receiving financial support from a commercial company that produces and provides active wound dressings may cause overestimation of the effect of this wound dressing. Each of the six domains will be classified as low risk of bias, high risk of bias or unclear risk of bias. Details for this classification are described in the Cochrane handbook. 27 Any discrepancy in the risk of bias assessment will be resolved by group discussion and arbitrated by a third reviewer (X-DC). The overall strength of the body of evidence will be assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). 28 ",

Examination of the clinical heterogeneity will focus on patients' baseline characteristics, healthcare facilities where patients receive wound dressings and duration of follow-up. Statistical heterogeneity will also be investigated with the I 2 statistics. Different wound dressings will first be categorised as different classes like hydrocolloid, hydrogel, silicones, etc. We will test the agreement in effect size in a specific class, using the I 2 value of 50% as a cut-off point. I 2 >50% indicates significant heterogeneity in the RCTs testing one of the wound dressing classes. We will second test the heterogeneity in individual wound dressings when possible. If the included RCTs show clinically or statistically significant heterogeneity, we will give a narrative review. Otherwise, we will proceed to a traditional meta-analysis, calculating the effect size of different classes of wound dressings compared with placebo or active controls. For continuous outcomes, standardised mean difference (SMD) will be calculated; for dichotomous outcomes, ORs will be computed. We will synthesise SMD or OR with the DerSimonian-Laird method (random-effects model).",

In this network meta-analysis, measures of relative effect sizes will be ORs in the dichotomous outcomes and SMDs in the continuous outcomes. Both ORs and SMDs will be reported with their 95% credible intervals (95% CI). The 95% CI could be elucidated as a 95% probability that the true OR or SMD falls in the reported range. The network meta-analysis will be performed with a random-effect model using WinBUGS 1.43 (MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge University, UK). Each analysis will be based on non-informative priors for calculation of effect sizes and 95% CI. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) to rank the wound dressing classes. The SUCRA presented as percentages compare each wound dressing with an intervention presumed as the best treatment without uncertainty, so a larger SUCRA means a more effective wound dressing class. Transitivity and consistency are the two key elements representing the credibility of a network meta-analysis. The assumption of transitivity is that the distribution of effect modifiers is not different in each pairwise comparison in the network. To account for transitivity in the network, we will assess participant's characteristics (infected or non-infected wounds, patients with or without diabetes, smoker or non-smoker, with or without long-term use of steroids), study designs (duration of follow-up and risk of bias) and interventions (duration of treatment and wound dressings given in primary or secondary or tertiary care). Consistency between direct and indirect comparisons will be assessed. The result of direct comparisons will be acquired through the aforementioned traditional meta-analysis, whereas the result of indirect comparisons will be obtained through excluding those studies with head-to-head comparisons. The consistency will be evaluated with the I 2 statistics, with an I 2 <25% indicating mild inconsistency, an I 2 between 25% and 50% showing moderate inconsistency, and an I 2 >50% representing severe inconsistency. Given the feature of Bayesian statistical analysis, p values will not be estimated and reported for each comparison.",
