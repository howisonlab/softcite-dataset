Methods: Data on surgical procedures and resulting complications were contemporaneously recorded on consented patients in 10 participating UK gynaecological cancer centres. Patients were sent follow-up letters to capture any further complications. Post-operative (Post-op) complications were graded (I-V) in increasing severity using the Clavien-Dindo system. Grade I complications were excluded from the analysis. Univariable and multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of complications using all surgery for intra-operative (Intra-op) and only those with both hospital and patient-reported data for Post-op complications.",

            "text": "Treatment outcomes are increasingly used by commissioners and consumers of health care to evaluate the performance of individual clinicians and institutions. This has led to some specialities developing clinician led national databases such as the National Surgical Quality Improvement Programme (NSQIP) in the United States (Khuri, 1998) and the national audits in cardiac surgery in England (Bridgewater, 2010). The hallmark of such initiatives is collection of comparable accurate data by clinical teams across hospitals, which make the calculation of risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality rates for surgical procedures possible. In gynaecological oncology, there is little such data available, with studies on surgical outcomes limited to single centre reports from United Kingdom (Das et al, 2006) and Australia (Kondalsamy Chennakesavan et al, 2009) and a three centre US ovarian cancer study (Aletti et al, 2007b) In England, the outcome data for gynaecological oncology procedures undertaken in the National Health Service (NHS) are limited to a few procedures such as hysterectomy and includes both benign and malignant disease. Surrogate markers of surgical performance such as duration of hospital admission ('length of stay'), readmission and repeat surgery ('return to theatre') rates collected as part of Hospital Episode Statistics (www.hesonline.nhs.uk) are used. The latter is an administrative national data repository containing details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and accident/ emergency attendances at NHS hospitals in England. It was initially established to evaluate/monitor resource allocation but is now increasingly being used to compare the quality of care provided by NHS hospitals, with summary data accessible to the public on the web (e.g., www.drfosterhealth.co.uk). However, studies comparing HES outcome data with clinician databases have shown that it is prone to error, omissions and inconsistencies (Westaby et al, 2007;Cockbain et al, 2012). One of the reasons for this is that there is little clinical input into data collection with coding officers capturing data from clinical notes, which are not uniformly standardised or structured across hospitals.",

For example, if adhesiolysis (score 1) and ureterolysis (score 1) were performed along with a total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH, score 1), the surgical complexity score was 3. Surgeries were categorised into five groups of increasing complexity based on the overall score (surgical complexity score 1 and 2: Group 1; 3 and 4: Group 2; 5 and 6: Group 3; 7 and 8: Group 4; 48: Group 5).

Post-op complications were defined as those complications occurring post-operatively up to 8 weeks after surgery. To capture Intra-op and Post-op complications, a pre-determined list of complications was compiled following literature review and several group discussions involving the participating surgeons (Supplementary Table 2). Intra-op complications were recorded by the surgeons in theatre. Estimated blood loss of 42.5 l was documented as Intra-op haemorrhage, regardless of whether haemorrhage was specifically identified as a complication by the operating surgeon. Completeness of Post-op complications was ensured by including both hospital-reported and patient-reported (via FULs) data as previously detailed (Iyer et al, 2013). Post-op complications were graded I-V using the Clavien and Dindo system based on the severity and intervention required (Dindo et al, 2004)  (Supplementary Table 3). Only Grade II-V Post-op complications were included in the analysis. Grade 1 complications were excluded as they were by definition 'any deviation from the normal post-operative course not requiring any pharmacological/surgical/radiological intervention' and therefore likely to be subject to individual variation and to have minimal impact on the post-operative course (Iyer et al, 2013).",

Significant Intra-op variables were laparoscopic approach that was associated with decreased risk of Post-op complications (OR \u00bc 0.65) and duration of surgery in hours that increased risk (OR \u00bc 1.3). Unlike for Intra-op complications, increased risk was associated with a diagnosis of vulval/vaginal (OR \u00bc 2.4) and cervical cancer (OR \u00bc 1.7).",

Whilst the overall Intra-op CR was 4.7%, it was 5.4% when limited to confirmed malignancies. Previous abdominal surgery, diabetes, surgical complexity and final diagnosis were significant predictors of increased risk. The Post-op CR was similar for overall (26%) and for confirmed malignancies (27%). The only common predictors of both Intra-op and Post-op complications were diabetes and final diagnosis. Other significant associations with Post-op complications were age, the presence of comorbidity, BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER Predictors of complications in gynaecological oncological surgery surgical approach and duration of surgery. Gynaecological oncology surgery is associated with considerable morbidity and our study provides much needed estimates of complication risk associated with procedures for specific cancers to counsel patients and benchmark surgical performance. Strengths of UKGOSOC include prospective data collection using standard forms, large sample size and multicentre design with 10 participating gynaecological cancer centres. Data capture from both clinicians and patients ensured completeness of Post-op complications. An online database, accessible to the clinical team whether they were in theatre, wards or outpatient departments facilitated capture of surgical data and complication events contemporaneously. Validity of the data was ensured by weekly review by an independent clinician at the CC, who contacted the teams on a regular basis to retrieve missing data and 'clean' erroneous entries. While clinician-led databases collect more accurate and complete information compared with administrative databases like HES (RCOG, 2012), this was a very resource intensive process. The heavy reliance of UKGOSOC on the clinical teams was a limitation. Most centres, especially those relying on junior trainees on four to six monthly rotations, struggled with prospective data entry.",

In keeping with majority of clinical studies, we are unable to provide an accurate number of women who were approached. Therefore, it is likely that all consecutive patients on operating lists have not been included. In 10% of surgeries, patients had Metabolic/Endocrine disorders other than diabetes. This mainly included hypercholesterolaemia and thyroid dysfunction and was a predictor of reduced intra-operative CR. We are unable to explain this and as previous studies have not looked at this separately, there is no data for comparison. Some pre-operative biochemical markers such as serum albumin and liver enzymes that have been reported to be predictors of surgical complications (Khuri, 1998;Copeland, 2002;Aletti et al, 2007b;Kondalsamy Chennakesavan et al, 2009) could not be included in our study as they are not routinely assayed in all patient undergoing gynaecological oncology surgery in United Kingdom.",

            "text": "Our overall Intra-op CR of 4.7% was lower than the 8% reported from a tertiary gynaecological oncology centre in Australia (Kondalsamy Chennakesavan et al, 2009), which we feel was probably influenced by the small sample size of 381 women in their study compared with nearly 3000 in ours (Kondalsamy Chennakesavan et al, 2009). No other comparable figures were available in the published literature. Rates for gynaecological malignancy alone were lower than Intra-op CRs in women undergoing pelvic surgery for rectal cancer surgery (12%) (van der Pas et al, 2013). The lower incidence of Intra-op complications was paralleled by the lower (1.6%) laparoscopic to emergency laparotomy conversion rates compared with the Australian study (2.4%) and the rectal cancer surgery multicentre trial (16%) (van der Pas et al, 2013). Lower CRs in surgeries for gynaecological compared with colorectal cancer are likely to be related to the lower rates of bowel resection and possible anastomosis and resultant lower incidence of anastomotic leaks, peritonitis or other bowel complications. In UKGOSOC, only 4.2% (91 out of 2192) of the cancer surgeries required a bowel resection. Previous abdominal surgery was a significant predictor of Intraop complications probably due to intra-abdominal adhesions following the previous surgery. This is in keeping with results of a prospective multicentre Finnish study (FINHYST) of over 5000 hysterectomies for benign indications (Brummer et al, 2011), which found that prior laparotomy (OR \u00bc 1.1) but not caesarean section or laparoscopy increased the risk of major complications. In the latter study, adhesiolysis during surgery was the strongest single risk factor (OR \u00bc 2.4). In bowel surgery, previous three or more laparotomies have been found to increase risk of enterotomy by tenfold (OR \u00bc 10.4) (Van Der Krabben et al, 2000). The other comorbidity that significantly increased Intra-op complication risk was diabetes (OR \u00bc 2). While several studies have demonstrated the association of diabetes with increased Post-op morbidity (Pull et al, 2012;Gimenes et al, 2013;Fischer et al, 2014) this is the first study to demonstrate its effect specifically on Intra-op complications. Intra-op CRs increased with surgical complexity with the highest rates for those procedures with an overall surgical complexity score of 48. In Aletti's study on ovarian cancer surgery as well as in the Australian study (Kondalsamy Chennakesavan et al, 2009), surgical complexity was found to be a significant predictor of overall morbidity. To capture complexity accurately in UKGOSOC, the surgical complexity scoring system for ovarian cancer developed by Aletti et al (2007a,b) was modified to include procedures for all gynaecological cancers and stratified into five rather than the three originally described (low, intermediate and high) groups as preliminary analysis had demonstrated it to be a key predictor. Although a higher proportion of procedures were of low complexity in UKGOSOC, we feel that direct comparisons with the Australian study are difficult to make as surgical complexity was defined differently in the two studies. Surgery for ovarian cancer had the highest crude Intra-op CR at 8% which was double of that seen for the other gynaecological cancers. This is mainly influenced by the complexity of ovarian cancer surgery when compared with that for the others (11% of ovarian cancer surgery had an overall complexity score of 45 when compared with 1-3% of the procedures for the other gynaecological malignancies).",

However, most of the complications were Grade II, which required medical therapy only as previously reported (Iyer et al, 2013). Vulval cancer (OR \u00bc 2.4) when compared with other cancers and benign diagnosis posed the highest risk of developing a Post-op complication. Vulval cancer surgery also had the highest crude Post-op-CR (41.8%) with wound infection/breakdown the commonest complication (32.9%) followed by lymphocysts/lymphoedema (18.9%). These rates were comparable to that reported in a recent review of complications of vulval cancer surgery where wound infection rates ranged from 17% to 39% and lymphoedema rates between 14% and 48% (Wills and Obermair, 2013). The incidence of intra-operative ureteric and bladder injury and postoperative bladder complications was highest for cervical cancer surgery when compared with other gynaecological cancers. However, this difference was not statistically significant ( Supplementary  Tables 7 and 8). This is likely to be related to the higher proportion of radical hysterectomies undertaken for cervical cancer. Overall, however, the rates are lower than those reported elsewhere, as in the United Kingdom, majority of radical hysterectomies are Type II rather than Type III as they are undertaken in patients with smaller tumours (Mota et al, 2008). Tumours of 44 cm are more likely to be treated with chemo-radiation.",

National data collection in this manner without dedicated administrative support would not be feasible. For such data to be collected on a national scale, one of the options would be to incorporate some of the key audit fields into existing data sources coupled with routine central follow-up of patients using validated questionnaires. Despite the logistical issues, internal auditing using the system of clinician led data capture adopted in this study might still be preferable and acceptable to clinicians rather than external regulations that might be imposed in the foreseeable future (Hacker, 2011).",
