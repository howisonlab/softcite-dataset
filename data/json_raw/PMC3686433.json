            "text": "In this paper, we performed a comprehensive re-annotation of protein-coding genes by a systematic method combining composition-and similarity-based approaches in 10 complete bacterial genomes of the family Neisseriaceae. First, 418 hypothetical genes were predicted as non-coding using the composition-based method and 413 were eliminated from the gene list. Both the scatter plot and cluster of orthologous groups (COG) fraction analyses supported the result. Second, from 20 to 400 hypothetical proteins were assigned with functions in each of the 10 strains based on the homology search. Among newly assigned functions, 397 are so detailed to have definite gene names. Third, 106 genes missed by the original annotations were picked up by an ab initio gene finder combined with similarity alignment. Transcriptional experiments validated the effectiveness of this method in Laribacter hongkongensis and Chromobacterium violaceum. Among the 106 newly found genes, some deserve particular interests. For example, 27 transposases were newly found in Neiserria meningitidis alpha14. In Neiserria gonorrhoeae NCCP11945, four new genes with putative functions and definite names (nusG, rpsN, rpmD and infA) were found and homologues of them usually are essential for survival in bacteria. The updated annotations for the 10 Neisseriaceae genomes provide a more accurate prediction of protein-coding genes and a more detailed functional information of hypothetical proteins. It will benefit research into the lifestyle, metabolism, environmental adaption and pathogenicity of the Neisseriaceae species. The re-annotation procedure could be used directly, or after the adaption of detailed methods, for checking annotations of any other bacterial or archaeal genomes."

            "text": "The emergence of next-generation DNA sequencing techniques accelerate tremendously the increment of sequences deposited in public nucleotide databases. The wealth of sequence data stimulates wonderful opportunity to understand the biological process of various living species. To achieve this aim, two of the essential steps are identifying all protein-coding genes and trying to assign their functions. They are jointly named as genome annotation. The quality of the genome annotation is very vital. If one genome could not be annotated accurately but still submitted to the public database, not only subsequent researches based on it may encounter problems but also annotations of after sequenced closely related genomes would be influenced. The annotation errors may propagate and finally affect more and more genomes. Recognizing this serious problem, Ouzounis and Kap 1 appealed to update regularly the genome annotation by latest database and methods."

            "text": "As for prokaryotes, dozens of genomes have been re-annotated. 2 Three kinds of re-annotations are often performed in sequenced prokaryotic genomes. First, and rather early, falsely predicted proteincoding genes are eliminated from the original annotation using composition-based methods. For example, Wang and Zhang 3 suggested that 172 annotated genes were very unlikely to encode proteins in the genome of Vibrio cholerae based on single-nucleotide frequencies. One of the typical re-annotation cases of archaea was associated with Aeropyrum pernix K1, in which protein-coding genes were over-annotated up to 60% by the original sequencing institute. 4 -6 It is lucky that this major error has been corrected by using proteome approaches and bioinformatics methods. 7 -10 Amsacta moorei entomopoxvirus may have the most over-annotated protein-coding genes among sequenced viruses. 11 Guo and Yu 12 suggested that 38 of 294 originally annotated genes did not encode proteins based on the Z-curve method. By using another graphical method, Yu and Sun 13 confirmed this speculation.",

However, alternative approaches may be utilized to obtain similar results with the systematic method used here. Compared with our previous work, 15 here, we used transcriptional analyses to validate the effectiveness of our method to pick up new genes. The Neisseriaceae family belongs to b-proteobacteria. Among the 10 Neisseriaceae strains analyzed in this work, seven belong to the genus Neisseria and all can colonize the mucosal surfaces of many animals.

The method is based on the Z-curve representation of the DNA sequences, which has been successfully used to find genes in various microbes. 3,7,9,12,15,16,28,29 In this analysis, 33 Z-curve variables were adopted, 26 including nine variables of phase-dependent single-nucleotide frequencies 28 and 24 of phase-dependent dinucleotide frequencies. 26 In fact, there are 36 variables denoting phase-dependent dinucleotides. 30 However, long-range correlations between the first and third codon positions tend to be weaker and so 12 variables associated with them were discarded. For details about these variables, refer to Guo et al. 26 Besides 33 classifying features, the Fisher linear discrimination algorithm was used to optimally differentiate protein-coding and non-coding sequences, the procedure was as detailed previously. 28 The training set of the classifying model comprised a positive sample set and a negative sample set. The positive sample set was those function-known genes with definite names, e.g. gyrB as the name of gene encoding protein of DNA gyrase subunit B. The negative sample was generated by a randomly shuffling sequence of the positive sample and thus destroying its natural structure. After parameters have been trained based on positive and negative samples, all hypothetical proteins would be decided to be genuine genes or falsely annotated non-coding sequences. The latter would be eliminated in the updated annotation. The scatter plot in Figure 1 illustrates the effectiveness of the method to eliminate non-coding ORFs from the collection of hypothetical proteins. A web server has been constructed to check hypothetical genes and eliminate non-coding ORFs in any sequenced bacterial or archaeal genomes, which is freely available at http://147.8.74. 24/Zfisher/.",

According to the RefSeq 24 annotation for each Neisseriaceae strain, all annotated genes could be classified into three groups. The first group contains only functionknown genes with definite names. The last group includes those genes encoding hypothetical proteins. The remaining genes constitute the second group. Obviously, the first group encodes proteins without any uncertainty. Coding potentials of the third group would be doubted to some extent. Therefore, we focus on the third group, hypothetical genes, in this work. Numbers of genes belong to the first and third groups and genomic characteristics of each strain are listed in Table 1. As can been seen, ratios of the numbers of the first and third class genes to the total gene number vary significantly. For example, N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 has the highest ratio of hypothetical genes, whereas almost the least ratio of function-known genes with definite names. This illustrates that the function annotation in this strain is much poorer compared with the other strains. The variation of the gene ratio is associated with many factors, such as annotation methods, genomic G \u00fe C contents and the number of closely related genomes that have been sequenced when annotating the strain.",

For example, in L. hongkongensis, the training set was comprised of 969 function-known genes that correspond to positive samples, and 969 shuffled sequences corresponding to negative samples. Based on the training set, the discriminant model was built. The accuracy of the model based on 5-fold cross-validation is listed in Table 2 for each of the 10 strains. With the model, each hypothetical protein was decided to be a genuine gene or a falsely predicted ORF.

If not, they should have been over-annotated as genes. The scatter plot of the nucleotide distribution of 969 function-known genes and 86 predicted non-coding ORFs is shown in Figure 1A and B. As can be seen, non-coding ORFs are distributed far away from function-known genes. In detail, almost all function-known genes lie far above the diagonal and G \u00fe C contents of them at the second codon positions are much lower than that at the third codon positions, whereas almost all 86 non-coding ORFs locate around the diagonal, indicating that their G \u00fe C contents at the second positions are approximate to that at the third codon positions. The need to encode functional proteins exerts severe constrain on the nucleotide composition of genes. 35 Previous work showed a similar nucleotide distribution of functional genes in seven high G \u00fe C prokaryotic genomes. 36,37 Therefore, the distinct nucleotide composition between 86 hypothetical genes and the function-known genes draw them away from being genuine genes.

In fact, there may still be the possibility that some of the genes, particularly those with GC 2 between 0.3 and 0.6, are falsely predicted as non-coding because of their very recent transfers. To investigate the possibility of clusters of horizontally transferred genes, we checked the chromosomal locations of these 86 ORFs and found that they not have any cluster pattern. Therefore, it is sure that, at least, most of the 85 eliminated ORFs do not belong to horizontally transferred genes and are indeed noncoding. Also note that 11 of the 20 horizontally transferred genes have been assigned the COG code and this ratio is much higher than that of the collective of the 85 eliminated ORFs.",

With this method, we found a varying number of missed genes with potential functions (Table 3). For example, eight new genes were added in L. hongkongensis, and details for them are listed in Table 4. RT-PCR analyses validated the transcriptions of all eight sequences (Fig. 2). Out of the 10 newly found genes in the genome of C. violaceum, transcriptions of eight ones are validated with RT-PCR and the exceptions are (Table 6) CV_A0007 and CV_A0010 (Fig. 3). All the amplification with genome DNA was positive (data not shown). Therefore, transcriptional analyses illustrated that the method was effective for picking up new genes and had very high accuracy. However, this method is only applicable to picking up genes having homologues in other genomes but not to strain-specific genes. In the other genomes, the method was directly used and without experimental validation.",

The details of the eight genes and their corresponding functions and the details of PCR primers and conditions used in the validation experiments are listed in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. For each of the remaining six overlapping genes, the region spanned by the two PCR primers does not overlap with the annotated genes and thus could reduce false-positive errors for the transcription trace. The six genes are analyzed as follows. LHK_A0001 overlaps the annotated gene LHK_00511. According to the annotation, the two sequences have the same potential function of encoding the phosphoserine phosphatase. LHK_A0001 has the similarity score of the E-value of 10 249 and Identity of 55% and the similarity score of LHK_00511 is the E-value of 10 239 and Identity of 65%. We could not decide which of them is the genuine gene based on the scores. LHK_00511 has the length of only 211 bp, which is much shorter than the length ( 669 bp) of known genes with the same function in other genomes. LHK_A0001 has the length of 471 bp. Based on the length information, LHK_A0001 is more likely to encode the phosphoserine phosphatase than LHK_00511. LHK_A0002 overlaps the annotated gene LHK_00916 with only 29 bp. LHK_A0002 is predicted to code for site-specific recombinase and LHK_00916 encodes replicase. Because they have so little overlap and have different functions, it is very likely that they are both genuine genes. LHK_A0005 has the potential function of encoding the Na \u00fe -dependent transporter. LHK_A0006 overlaps 61 bp with one functional gene but they locate on two different DNA strands. LHK_A0007 and the annotated rpsI gene (LHK_02777) constitute an interesting overlap. After the blast alignment, both of them are found to be significantly similar to the rpsI gene in the other genomes. As shown in Figure 4, LHK_A0007 matches the last 141 bp (57 aa) of the other rpsI genes and LHK_02777 matches the first 219 bp (73 aa). LHK_A0007 and LHK_02777 as a whole just constitute a complete rpsI gene (130 aa). In fact, LHK_A0007 and LHK_ 02777 are adjacent and overlapping. For the overlapping part, LHK_A0007 has the correct reading frame but the LHK_02777 does not have the correct frame, according to the other rpsI genes. Therefore, it is suggested that there has appeared an event of nucleotide insertion/deletion for the rpsI gene in L. hongkongensis. After point mutation, the single reading frame changed to two different ORFs. In this work, the two generated segments could be transcribed and should have functions. But we do not For the 10 newly found potential genes in C. violaceum, there are not so serious cases of overlapping with annotated genes as in L. hongkongensis.

According to the RefSeq annotation for NH8B_2210, the original authors seemed to have predicted that there is a stop codon treated as the selenocystein codon.

The strain alpha14 N. meningitidis has the most found new genes and interestingly 27 among the 30 new genes encode transposases. Although their aa identities with known transposases in genomes beyond the Neisseria genus tend to be just slightly higher than 50%, the identity is higher than 80% for each of them with counterparts in the same genus. Furthermore, the coverage at each case is greater than 90%. Therefore, predicted functions of encoding transposases for the 27 new genes are reliable. According to the RefSeq annotation, none of the genes code for transposases in this strain. However, 55, 29 and 33 transposases have been annotated in the other three strains of N. meningitidis. The lower sensitivity of the ab initio gene finder used in the annotation of N. meningitidis alpha14 is suggested to be responsible for the missing of transposases. In fact, some of transposases, which aid the integration insertion of genomic islands or single horizontally transferred gene, tend to own abnormal nucleotide composition and are easily missed by composition-based programmes. 41 In addition, some genes with important functions have been added in the N. meningitidis genomes, such as the haemoglobin receptor in 053442, transcription elongation factor (greA) in alpha14, protein methyltransferase (hemK) in Z2491, leucyl aminopeptidase ( pepA) and allophanate hydrolase subunit 2 in MC58.

            "text": "functions For the genomes sequenced several years ago, functional information may be outdated. 16,29 Especially, some hypothetical genes may have functional counterparts in current databases, 16 whereas they are still annotated as hypothetical. This section is aiming to provide functional information for hypothetical genes in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains by using the similarity search method. To ensure reliable function transfer, severe homologous conditions were adopted. After the blast search, varying numbers of hypothetical proteins were assigned functions in the 10 Neisseriaceae genomes (Table 3). Among them, L. hongkongensis and Pseudogulbenkiania have the least numbers perhaps because their genomes were most recently sequenced. In the two strains of the N. gonorrhoeae, the strain FA 1090 has the larger number of assigned functions and it just was sequenced earlier than NCCP11945. 23,42 Among the four strains of the species, N. meningitidis MC58 has the largest number and it just was sequenced earliest among them. 23 Therefore, the number of hypothetical proteins with newly assigned functions may be tightly associated with sequenced time of the genome. In fact, if one genome has been sequenced at earlier year, it should have more functional counterparts in the current public database but not existed at that time. 29 The original annotation would be more outdated for earlier sequenced genome in the sense of function information. Among newly assigned functions, some have been provided definite names (Table 8) and this transferred annotation information should be unquestionable. For example, the hypothetical gene LHK_02863 in L. hongkongensis has been assigned not only the function encoding iron-sulphur cluster assembly protein but also the definite name 'IscA'. Some other genes were assigned with detailed functions and would be reliable with this function because stringent homologous criteria were adopted. However, there are still some hypothetical proteins with only general functions, such as membrane proteins, lipoproteins and periplasmic proteins (Table 8). This type of rough function information would give help for the determination of more detailed functions.",

            "text": "During the process of genome re-annotation for the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, we found an interesting phenomenon. In a specific genome, two adjacent ORFs, which are predicted as genes by the ZCURVE program, have the same function with known genes in the other species. The total length of the two ORFs just corresponds to that of the known counterparts or just a little different from them. Based on similarity scores, both of the two ORFs should be predicted as genes with the corresponding function. However, either of them is much shorter than the functional counterpart and could not constitute a homologue in the sense of length information. Perrodou et al. 43 stated that unrecognized frameshifts, in-frame stop codons and sequencing errors often led to interrupted coding sequences. Very recently, Sharma et al. 44 performed a pilot study on bacterial genes with disrupted ORFs. Their results indicated that many disrupted genes likely utilized the nonstandard decoding mechanisms: programmed ribosomal frameshifting and programmed transcriptional realignment. Given that our recognized adjacent ORFs have identical functions, they should originate from the disruption of a longer gene by a frameshift or an in-frame stop codon and rarely by the sequencing error. Numbers of disrupted ORFs are listed in Table 3 and details of them are illustrated in Supplementary Table S4. Totally, 111 disrupted ORFs (or partial genes) were identified in six strains of the genus Neisseria and two in L. hongkongensis. According to Sharma et al., 44 some of the disrupted ORFs still encode proteins. Consistent with this, both of the disrupted ORFs LHK_A0007 (newly predicted) and LHK_02777 (originally annotated) are found to be transcribed in L. hongkongensis cells by the PCR experiment. Further wet experiment on functions of the other disrupted ORFs would be interesting.",

Latest database may contain new functional genes which were not yet assigned functional information when the analyzed genome was sequenced. 29 Those newly added functional information would provide the source of function transfer for some hypothetical genes in the analyzed genome. Sometimes, a few genes missed by the original annotation may be found with the similarity alignment. 25 In this work, a total of 2069 hypothetical genes were assigned with general or detailed functions based on homology search against latest database. Among the 10 Neisseriaceae strains, N. gonorrhoeae FA 1090 and N. meningitidis MC58 and Z2491 were sequenced and annotated earlier. 23 Correspondingly, the numbers of newly assigned functions in them are the largest. Therefore, the time from the sequencing is longer and the function annotation is more likely to be outdated. As for newly found genes, all 10 strains except N. meningitidis alpha14 contain a small number. In fact, it is rather difficult to find genes missed by the original annotation using the similarity-based method. When annotating the genome originally, predicted genes, particularly those having similar counterparts, would be retained as far as possible. Therefore, newly identified genes usually are only those having counterparts newly added in the database. As an exception, as many as 30 genes were newly found in the strain of N. meningitidis alpha14 and 27 of them correspond to transposases. We speculate that the less sensitivity of the ab initio programme, which has been used in the original annotation, for the external genes leads to the missing of the 27 genes associated with insertion function.",

            "text": "When annotating this genome, only one ab initio gene finder was used. 42 Usually, two or more ab initio programmes are used in annotating the other bacterial genomes. Based on the very abnormal gene density of the strain, we suppose that there may still be non-coding ORFs, besides the 56 ones excluded by us. Besides the annotation method and sequencing time, some other factors also cause the different extent of errors. For example, genes in high G \u00fe C bacterial genomes are shown to be difficultly predicted with high accuracy and this is caused by the fact that many long ORFs appear in this type of genomes. 32 In addition, the genome could be difficultly predicted accurately if there are only distantly related species in the public databases. 33 We should note that there still probably are noncoding ORFs and missed genes after the present updated annotation in the 10 Neisseriaceae strains. To assure reliable results, we picked up only those sequences with very higher similarities when identifying missed genes and we used the method with lower specificity when excluding non-coding ORFs. In addition, some thoroughly new genes, which have not significant similarities with any known genes, may be found by combing ab initio programme and wet experimental validation. However, the 106 newly found genes are those having similar counterparts based on latest databases. Also note that different detailed methods may be used to check the annotations of the other bacterial genomes, although the present systematic method has shown to be effective and reliable. For example, the recently developed ab initio gene finder Prodigal, 32 which has lower false positives could replace or jointly used with ZCURVE 1.0. Here, we used only the latter because the use of both of them generates basically consistent results (data not shown). The RPGM program, 39 which is also based on the graphical representation of the DNA sequence, could be chosen as an alternative to eliminate non-coding ORFs.",
