            "text": "Background: Decentralization and task shifting has significantly improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Many studies conducted to determine the attrition rate in Ethiopia have not compared attrition rates between hospitals and health centers in a relatively recent cohort of patients. This study compared death and loss to follow-up (LTFU) rates among ART patients in hospitals and health centers in south Ethiopia. Methods: Data routinely collected from patients aged older than 15 years who started ART between July 2011 and August 2012 in 20 selected health facilities (12 being hospitals) were analyzed. The outcomes of interest were LTFU and death. The data were entered, cleaned, and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 and Stata version 12.0. Competing-risk regression models were used. Results: The service years of the facilities were similar (median 8 and 7.5 for hospitals and health centers, respectively). The mean patient age was 33.7\u00b19.6 years. The median baseline CD4 count was 179 (interquartile range 93-263) cells/mm 3. A total of 2,356 person-years of observation were made with a median follow-up duration of 28 (interquartile range 22-31) months; 24.6% were either dead or LTFU, resulting in a retention rate of 75.4%. The death rates were 3.0 and 1.5 and the LTFU rate were 9.0 and 10.9 per 100 person-years of observation in health centers and hospitals, respectively. The competing-risk regression model showed that the gap between testing and initiation of ART, body mass index, World Health Organization clinical stage, isoniazid prophylaxis, age, facility type, and educational status were independently associated with LTFU. Moreover, baseline tuberculous disease, poor functional status, and follow-up at a health center were associated with an elevated probability of death. Conclusion: We observed a higher death rate and a lower LTFU rate in health centers than in hospitals. Most of the associated variables were also previously documented. Higher LTFU was noticed for patients with a smaller gap between testing and initiation of treatment.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 35.0 million people were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at the end of 2013, with 2.1 million people becoming newly infected with HIV in 2013 globally. In 2013, 12.9 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally, of which 11.7 million were receiving ART in low-income and middle-income countries. The 11.7 million people on ART represent 36% of the 32.6 million people living with HIV in low-income and middle-income countries. 1 The Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples' Regional State is the third largest administrative region in Ethiopia and represents about 20% of the country's population. The prevalence of HIV in the region was estimated at 1.5%. 2 According to the 2013 health performance report of the regional heath bureau, 35,271 patients had ever started on ART, while 24,900 patients were currently on ART, up from 14,493 in 2010. 3 As the number of patients on ART continues to increase, it will be of paramount importance to give due focus to the quality of care, to ensure optimal viral suppression and to improve quality of life for people living with HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. One of these is to ensure that patients are retained in care that will have both individual and societal benefit. 4 A higher attrition rate has been linked to poorer viral suppression and increased morbidity and mortality, among many other undesirable outcomes, both at the community and individual level. [5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Systematic reviews conducted previously indicate that rates of attrition from ART care are prevailing problems in sub-Saharan Africa. [12][13][14] Previous studies in Ethiopia have shown a high attrition rate, although most were single facility-based studies and were conducted in relatively previous cohorts. 9,15,16 Estimates of retention/attrition rates at the region level for relatively recent cohorts and comparisons of the rates in hospitals and health centers have not been done. Therefore, in this study, we estimated the attrition rate of HIV patients on ART in the region and attempted to identify predictors of such attrition, including facility type, which has not been studied previously. The findings will be used to identify interventions to improve retention in ART care.",

Another study conducted in two hospitals in the Oromia region, Ethiopia, documented a 10.3% death rate and an 18.0% LTFU rate over 2 years of follow-up. 16 The higher death rate in the study from Oromia might be attributable to the fact that 85% of the study participants had a baseline CD4 count ,200 cells/mm 3 , whereas this figure was 52.6% in our study. Similarly, 70.9% of the Oromia study participants were late-stage presenters, while in the current study only 44.1% presented late. Another study from south Ethiopia, in which the majority (62.5%) of patients were late presenters, reported a death rate of 11.3%. 9 Such differences could be because of two reasons. First, patients may be presenting earlier in the course of the disease, and second, the shift in eligibility criteria to higher CD4 counts may also be contributing to early initiation of ART. This clearly indicates the public return in terms of lives saved because of early presentation and/or early treatment initiation for HIV.",

A study from rural Malawi reported an attrition rate of 23% 20 and another study from South Africa also reported an attrition rate of 26.4% among health facility based adherence support group, which is a similar context with our study. 24 The current attrition rate is also similar to that in the 2003-2007 cohort in south Ethiopia. 19 The sensitivity analysis of a systematic review conducted to estimate patient retention in LTFU was higher in hospitals than in health centers. Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidences of death and LTFU using competing risk analysis and stratified by facility type. sub-Saharan Africa estimated that the retention rate ranged from 24% in the worst case to 77% in the best case at the end of 2 years of follow-up. 12 Death rate calculations might be influenced by other external conditions. Health facilities may not accurately capture the death event. This implies that some patients classified as \"lost\" may have actually died if there is no strong tracing system to record the final outcome for such patients. In line with this, several studies have shown that most individuals who are LTFU have in fact died but are not detected by the health system. Previous studies conducted in south Ethiopia and Malawi have shown that around half of patients who are LTFU are found to be dead when traced by health facilities. [9][10][11] Also, in the current study, the poor clinical condition, as measured in terms of WHO clinical stage, of patients who are LTFU suggests that these patients might have died of the disease, unbeknownst to the health system.",

Higher death rates in health centers were also reported from other studies conducted in Malawi. 20,25 In our study, we observed that patients who had a short time interval between learning of their HIV infection status and initiation of treatment were more likely to be LTFU when compared with their counterparts. This indicates that acceptance of disease status and long-term willingness to stay in care depends partly on to what level patients are psychologically accepting and managing the early denial stage of their HIV test result. Indepth counseling may be needed for patients who start treatment relatively soon after learning of their HIV-positive status. Other risk factors for an elevated risk of LTFU were low body mass index at treatment initiation, being in a young age group (#25 years), not starting isoniazid prophylaxis, being cared for in hospital rather than in a health center, not attending formal education, and late WHO clinical stage at initiation of treatment. Most of these findings are in agreement with those of several previous studies, 9,10,15,22,23,[26][27][28][29][30][31][32] Even though our point estimate for risk of LTFU or death showed males to be at increased risk, the association failed to reach statistical significance. However, other studies have found this relationship to be significant. 22,26,28,31 The multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for death included being cared for in a health center rather than in a hospital, a diagnosis of tuberculosis at initiation of treatment, and poor functional status. These findings are similar to those of previous studies conducted in Ethiopia and elsewhere. 9,16,27,28,31,33 The mortality excess is more than twice in health centers when compared with hospitals. This might be because of differences in the quality of care in terms of availability of facilities and high-level health workers to manage complicated cases. This calls for a careful analysis of the referral and linkage system in place to ensure an equitable distribution of health care services.",

The findings are only for patients who were initiated on treatment and do not address retention over the continuum of HIV care. 14 Missing values for some variables like body mass index were very large and may have resulted in bias or calculation errors. The possible outcomes might not have been accurately captured as patients who were classified as LTFU might have actually died or been cared for in other facilities. The competing-risk regression may partly solve the problem but the real final treatment outcome of the clients still remain undetermined. 34 ",

Compared with previous studies in similar settings, patients are now started on treatment at a relatively earlier stage. The LTFU rate was higher in hospitals than in health centers; however, there is an excess death rate among patients being followed up in health centers. We recommend further studies to explore why this is happening.  ",
