Materials and methods Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, parallel-groups design, 150 healthy adults (mean age 34.78 years) consumed drinks containing placebo, 25 g glucose, 60 g glucose or 60 g glucose with 40 mg caffeine. They completed a multitasking framework at baseline and then 30 min following drink consumption with mood assessments immediately before and after the multitasking framework. Blood glucose and salivary caffeine were co-monitored. Results The caffeine-glucose group had significantly better total multi-tasking scores than the placebo or 60 g glucose groups and were significantly faster at mental arithmetic tasks than either glucose drink group. There were no significant treatment effects on mood. Caffeine and glucose levels confirmed compliance with overnight abstinence/fasting, respectively, and followed the predicted post-drink patterns. Conclusion These data suggest that co-administration of glucose and caffeine allows greater allocation of attentional resources than placebo or glucose alone. At present, we cannot rule out the possibility that the effects are due to caffeine alone Future studies should aim at disentangling caffeine and glucose effects.",

Caffeine (and to a lesser extent glucose) are used partly because of their potential cognition-enhancing properties. Although they are often co-consumed, including increasingly in the form of energy drinks, there is surprisingly little research examining the effects of the two substances in combination in the context of neurocognitive function.",

Lower doses of caffeine have been less thoroughly researched, but doses as low as 12.5 mg, a level roughly equivalent to half a serving of cola, have been shown to be psychopharmacologically active (Smit and Rogers, 2000).",

In a follow-up study that used the same doses and included a functional magnetic resonance imaging component, the same group found no differences in performance of an attentional task between glucose, caffeine and their combination (Serra Grabulosa et al., 2010).

Interventions that have the capacity to improve these cognitive abilities are therefore of interest both scientifically and practically. The current study was therefore designed to assess the potential effects of glucose (two doses, 25 and 60 g) and a caffeine-glucose combination (60 g glucose, 40 mg caffeine) on cognitive performance and mood associated with cognitive multi-tasking.

As dividing cognitive resources over several tasks involves relatively high mental effort, we hypothesised that the two doses of glucose alone would also improve performance.

            "text": "Supporting our hypothesis, there was a significant treatment effect on multi-tasking performance with those in the caffeine-glucose drink outperforming the placebo condition. Multi-tasking performance was also significantly better in the caffeine-glucose condition than in the 60 g glucose drink condition. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a caffeineglucose drink can increase the amount of attentional resources, which can be allocated to task performance. This is in broad agreement with the results of a functional magnetic resonance imaging study showing lower levels of neural activation following a caffeine-glucose combination (albeit at different levels) than placebo or caffeine or glucose alone (Serra Grabulosa et al., 2010). Regarding the mechanisms underlying superior multi-tasking, we can be confident that the double blind was effective and that expectations as to conditions did not influence results. Treatment guessing  did not differ significantly by condition. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that those in the caffeine-glucose condition were able to change their strategy to optimise their score. However, this seems unlikely as the most effective strategy to increase overall score is to focus on the working memory task, and there was no evidence that this was the case. There were significant improvements to the speed of performing mental arithmetic associated with the caffeine-glucose drink. Those in the combination drink were faster than either glucose drink alone, again suggesting that caffeine conferred a benefit to performance. Mathematical processing requires manipulation of information held in consciousness and, like multi-tasking, draws heavily on working memory and  executive processes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the caffeine-glucose combination can improve executive functioning through the allocation of more attentional resources to multi-task performance. There was also some evidence of improvements to the speed of responding on the Stroop module. The Stroop task is a classic measure of selective attention and response inhibition. Again, effective performance relies on executive responses-in this case, inhibiting the response to the word meaning in favour of its perceptual properties. Counter to our hypotheses, there were no behavioural effects of either dose of glucose alone. Those in the 25 g glucose condition had numerically better performance (although this did not approach statistical significance), whereas performance in the 60 g condition was similar to that in placebo and significantly worse than that in the caffeine-glucose drink. These performance differences between the two glucose-only conditions support the notion of an inverted U doseresponse curve for glucose on some aspects of cognition (Riby, 2004). With regard to specific outcomes, in previous studies examining the effects of glucose on sequentially performed tasks, 25 g glucose has improved working memory (serial subtraction) performance (Scholey et al., 2001). On the other hand, performance of a task very similar to the working memory module in the current study was unaffected by 37.5 g glucose, either alone or in combination with glucose (Scholey and Kennedy, 2004). Owen et al. (2012) specifically compared the mood and cognitive effects of 25 and 60 g glucose drinks. Her data reveal a complex pattern of effects, with the two doses interacting differentially with task type and fast duration. The 25 g drink was associated with better serial sevens performance following a 2-h fast only, and faster choice reaction times following an overnight fast only. The 60 g dose speeded word recognition and improved serial threes performance following an overnight (but not 2 h) fast. None of the affected tasks were a direct analogue of those in the current study. Nevertheless, we have previously argued that tasks that require higher levels of mental effort for effective execution are more susceptible to the glucose enhancement effect. It might be assumed that multi-tasking would fall into this category, and indeed the mood changes associated performing the MTF support this contention. On the other hand, previous studies that have found effects of glucose (usually 25 g) during dual tasking have included more individual task such as effortful psychomotor tracking (Scholey et al., 2009b) or repeated, alternating hand movements (S\u00fcnram-Lea et al., 2002). The effect may be because such tasks are more effortful than the MTF used in the current study, for example, co-performing hand movements can reduce memory performance to near chance levels (Scholey et al., 2013;Scholey et al., 2006). Alternatively, previous dual tasking studies have typically included a declarative memory component, which may be more susceptible to the glucoserelated enhancement. These positive effects seen here may be due to the additive/synergistic effects of glucose and caffeine in combination, supporting previous behavioural studies showing that the effects of caffeine and glucose together were significantly better than those of either substance alone (Scholey and Kennedy, 2004). Alternatively, at present, we cannot rule out the possibility that they may be attributable to caffeine contained within this treatment only. Future studies should compare the effects of caffeine alone with the other treatments used in the current study.",
