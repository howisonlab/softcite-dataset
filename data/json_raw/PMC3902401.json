The objective of this study was to characterise long-term mortality following a sepsis event. Design: Population-based data from the 30 239 community-dwelling individuals in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Setting: USA. Participants: Community-dwelling adults \u226545 years of age. Sepsis was defined as hospitalisation or emergency department treatment for a serious infection with the presence of \u22652 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Outcomes: 6-year all-cause mortality. The analysis utilised a time-varying Cox model adjusted for participant's age, demographic factors, health behaviours and chronic medical conditions. Results: The participants were observed for a median of 6.1 years (IQR 4.5-7.1). During this period, 975 individuals experienced a sepsis event. Sepsis hospital mortality was 8.9%. One-year, 2-year and 5-year allcause mortality among individuals with sepsis were 23%, 28.8% and 43.8%, respectively, compared with death rates of 1%, 2.6% and 8.3% among those who never developed sepsis. On multivariable analysis, the association of sepsis with increased all-cause mortality persisted for up to 5 years, after adjustment for confounders; year 0.00-1.00, adjusted HR (aHR) 13.07"

[1][2][3] While prior studies describe the acute care and course of individuals developing sepsis, relatively limited data characterise the longterm consequences of a sepsis event. 4 This gap in knowledge is important as the total public health impact of a disease encompasses not only the course of acute hospital care but also its downstream sequelae. Furthermore, compared with unaffected persons, an individual suffering from a disease-even after recovery from the acute illness-may also experience a higher risk of long-term death.",

Each participant provided blood and urine specimens. Self-administered questionnaires evaluated diet, family history of diseases, psychosocial factors and prior residences. The study contacted participants at 6-month intervals by telephone, identifying the date, location and attributed reason for all emergency department visits and hospitalisations during the follow-up period.

Compared with individuals who did not develop sepsis, rates of death among individuals experiencing sepsis were twofold higher for up to 5 years after the sepsis event.

            "text": "Our findings add to the body of knowledge highlighting the downstream consequences of sepsis. As highlighted in Winters et al's 4 systematic review, most sepsis mortality studies have focused on shorter endpoints,   inadequately controlled for baseline comorbidities, and relied on population norms as matched controls. Other studies focused on intensive care unit patients with sepsis, used data from single or smaller groups of centres or utilised discharge diagnoses to identify sepsis events. [6][7][8] Our contrasting study utilised a large (>30 000 persons) and diverse population-based sample of community-dwelling individuals in the USA and entailed follow-up of up to 6 years. Rather than relying on hospital discharge diagnoses, a process that may underdetect sepsis cases, we identified sepsis through review of hospital records. 1 17 We were able to account and adjust for baseline comorbidities that may affect the outcomes of sepsis and non-sepsis individuals. It is unclear whether increased sepsis mortality reflects the increased susceptibility of those with heightened comorbid burden or whether sepsis triggers an independent pathophysiological process leading to early death. 18 Where adjudicated cause of death was available, 70% of deaths following a sepsis event were attributed to a range of other conditions, including cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. We also identified that select chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic lung disease were independent predictors of early death among individuals with sepsis. Other described sequelae of sepsis include acute kidney injury, atrial fibrillation, cognitive impairment, functional disability and impaired quality of life. [19][20][21][22] Additional study must confirm the mechanisms by which sepsis creates or complicates the management of these other conditions. For example, does sepsis increase longterm mortality by causing acute kidney injury and subsequent chronic kidney disease? Another important question is whether prevention or optimal management of these parallel conditions might reduce the long-term rates of sepsis death. For example, could optimal management of sepsis-triggered chronic kidney alter an individual's risk of death?",

We could not identify sepsis events not reported by participants. We did not examine the influence of repeat sepsis events, which could conceivably increase the risk of mortality. We identified individuals who presented to the hospital with sepsis, but did not include those who acquired sepsis during their hospitalisation; we would expect inclusion of the latter individuals to amplify the observed mortality differences.

As with all observational studies, residual confounding is always a concern. However, our risk adjustment strategy accounted for a comprehensive range of variables that were systematically identified for each participant at the beginning of the REGARDS study.
