            "text": "Cotranslational degradation of polypeptide nascent chains plays a critical role in quality control of protein synthesis and the rescue of stalled ribosomes. In eukaryotes, ribosome stalling triggers release of 60S subunits with attached nascent polypeptides, which undergo ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Ltn1 and proteasomal degradation facilitated by the AT-Pase Cdc48. However, the identity of factors acting upstream in this process is less clear. Here, we examined how the canonical release factors Sup45-Sup35 (eRF1-eRF3) and their paralogs Dom34-Hbs1 affect the total population of ubiquitinated nascent chains associated with yeast ribosomes. We found that the availability of the functional release factor complex Sup45-Sup35 strongly influences the amount of ubiquitinated polypeptides associated with 60S ribosomal subunits, while Dom34-Hbs1 generate 60Sassociated peptidyl-tRNAs that constitute a relatively minor fraction of Ltn1 substrates. These results uncover two separate pathways that target nascent polypeptides for Ltn1-Cdc48-mediated degradation and suggest that in addition to canonical termination on stop codons, eukaryotic release factors contribute to cotranslational protein quality control."

Inefficient or dysfunctional QC may cause accumulation of aberrant and aggregation-prone polypeptides, a condition implicated in a wide range of human disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer (reviewed in (1)). Recent studies in eukaryotic cells have demonstrated that aberrant and misfolded polypeptide nascent chains (NCs) can undergo modification with ubiquitin while still attached to the ribosome, thereby initiating the degradation of the aberrant polypeptides by the proteasome (2)(3)(4)(5). Given that as much as 6-15% of all newly generated polypeptides in eukaryotic cells fail to fold or assemble properly (3,5), the systems responsible for cotranslational QC are clearly important for maintaining protein homeostasis.",

            "text": "Currently, cotranslational degradation of NCs is best understood in the situations when ribosomes stall during elongation. Previous studies indicated that a complex of the release-like factors Dom34-Hbs1 (also known as Pelota-Hbs1 in mammalian cells) acts in concert with the recycling factor Rli1 (ABCE1 in mammals) to split stalled ribosomes into subunits (6)(7)(8)(9). After dissociation from 40S, 60S subunits with associated NCs (60S\u2022NC complexes) are recognized by the ribosome quality control (RQC) complex consisting of Ltn1, Rqc1 and Rqc2 (also known as Tae2) (2,10). Rqc2 binds to the intersubunit surface, prevents reassociation of the ribosomal subunits (11)(12)(13), signals translation stress to the heat shock factor Hsf1 (10,13), and promotes activity of the E3 ligase Ltn1 (12). Ltn1 (also known as Rkr1 in yeast and Listerin in mammals) modifies NCs in 60S\u2022NC complexes with polyubiquitin chains, leading to the recruitment of the ubiquitin-selective chaperone complex Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 (2,4,10,14,15). It is currently believed that because of a steric clash with the 40S subunit, Ltn1 cannot bind to translating ribosomes, which likely serves to prevent ubiquitination of NCs by Ltn1 during elongation (11,12). The AAA family ATPase Cdc48 assists the clearance of the 60S-associated polypeptides, presumably by supplying mechanical force for the extraction of NCs and their presentation to the proteasome.",

            "text": "The RQC system is conserved in all eukaryotes and defects in its components have been linked to neurodegeneration in mice (16,17). The nature of the RQC substrates in the cell, however, remains an open question (18). The pioneering work by the Inada laboratory (19,20) demonstrated ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of NCs utilizing poly(Lys)-and poly(Arg)-containing model substrates, which were later investigated in conjunction with the RQC system (2,4,10,14). However, ribosomal stalling can occur in many other situations, including impaired cotranslational protein folding, the presence of rare codons and stable secondary structures within mRNA (3,5,21,22). Recent evidence indeed points to additional types of translational stalling contributing endogenous substrates to the RQC pathway (23,24). Additionally, the translation factors that generate RQC substrates are not completely understood. Dom34-Hbs1 play a pivotal role in splitting non-translating 80S ribosomes containing Stm1 in place of the mRNA (25) and have been shown to operate efficiently on ribosomal complexes with a short mRNA length relative to the ribosome's P-site, such as ribosomes stalled at the 3 end of truncated mRNA and some nonstop messages (7,8,26). Moreover, aberrant nonstop polypeptides were observed to be stabilized by an ltn1\u0394 deletion in the absence of Dom34 (27). Thus, the contribution of Dom34-Hbs1 to cotranslational QC on a global scale remains unclear. Intriguingly, canonical release factors were recently reported to mediate release of ribosomes on polylysine-encoding segments of mRNA (28), although whether this contributes to degradation of other aberrant translation products is currently unknown. Here, we addressed the role of factors that operate upstream of Ltn1 ubiquitination in ribosome-associated degradation by investigating the global pattern of modification of distinct ribosomal species with ubiquitin.",

The strain GT181 was selected as a spontaneous Ade + derivative of OT60 on -Ade medium and determined to bear a mutant allele of the SUP35 gene (designated sup35-R15) in a test for allelism using tester strains 66-8A-P3532 (MAT\u03b1 ade1-14 his7-1 met13-A1 sup45 [rho \u2212 ]) and 68-8A-P3532 (MAT\u03b1 ade1-14 his7-1 met13-A1 sup35), kindly provided by S.G. Inge-Vechtomov (St. Petersburg State University, Russia). PCR amplification and sequencing of the sup35-R15 allele showed a single G-to-T substitution at nucleotide position 1615 (relative to the start of the Sup35 coding sequence), which created a premature stop codon instead of codon 535 in the SUP35 ORF. The sup35-R15 allele in the strain GT181 causes temperature sensitivity of growth on complete medium, with the permissive temperature of 25 \u2022 C and non-permissive temperature of 30 \u2022 C and above.

            "text": "To examine how endogenous targets of cotranslational protein QC are distributed among different subpopulations of ribosomes in yeast cells, we fractionated cytoplasmic lysates by sedimentation through sucrose gradients. We observed a smear of ubiquitinated translation products in fractions containing polysomes and 80S monosomes in wild-type cells ( Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S1A), consistent with the previously described ubiquitination of ribosomeassociated NCs (3,4). Previous studies have shown that loss of Cdc48 function increases accumulation of ubiquitinated NCs associated with ribosomes (2-4). To better define this effect, we analyzed yeast strains in which CDC48 is placed under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter (P TET-O7 -CDC48) (39). Depletion of Cdc48 by addition of doxycycline (Dox) to growing yeast cultures significantly increased the intensity of the ubiquitin signal in these cells ( Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S1A-D), as expected from stabilization of ubiquitinated NCs that normally undergo Cdc48-assisted degradation by the proteasome (4). The ubiquitin signal in Cdc48-depleted cells was mainly concentrated in fractions 3-5 ( Figure 1B), corresponding to the peaks of 60S subunits (fractions 3 and 4) and 80S monosomes (fractions 4 and 5). In this and other experiments, the equivalent separation of ribosomal fractions on gradients was controlled by comparing alignment of A 260 traces of the gradients, gel analysis of rRNA from the same fractions that were used for protein isolation, Ponceau S staining to control protein transfer, and probing with antibodies against ribosomal protein Rpl3 (Supplementary Figure S1A). When it was necessary to compare absolute levels of ubiquitinated species between different strains, we analyzed fractions side by side on the same gel to rule out variations between processing of individual membranes (Supplementary Figure  S1D). Notably, the increase in ubiquitination of the 80S fraction was not due to redistribution of ribosomes from polysomes to the 80S monosome form in Cdc48-depleted cells, as shift of wild-type cells to medium lacking glucose (a condition known to inhibit translation initiation) resulted in elevated 80S levels comparable to those in Dox-treated P TET-O7 -CDC48 cells, but did not cause accumulation of polyubiquitinated peptides in the 60S-80S fractions (Supplementary Figure S1E). Thus, Cdc48 depletion leads to increased accumulation of ubiquitinated polypeptides associated predominantly with 60S and 80S ribosomes.",

In wild-type cells, hygromycin treatment significantly increased the amount of polyubiquitinated products present in the 60S-80S fractions (Figure 1E). Similarly to P TET-O7 -CDC48 ltn1\u0394 cells, deletion of LTN1 abrogated the accumulation of ubiquitinated products in the 60S, but not 80S fraction in the hygromycintreated cells ( Figure 1E). Consistent with a role of Ltn1 in resolving translation errors caused by hygromycin, ltn1\u0394 cells are hypersensitive to this antibiotic ( Figure 1F). These results support the idea that the Ltn1-Cdc48-mediated QC mechanism can capture a variety of defective translational products that remain associated with the large ribosomal subunit after splitting of the ribosome.",

            "text": "Having found that gradient analysis can differentiate Ltn1modified NCs from those ubiquitinated through Ltn1independent mechanisms, we sought to probe the upstream events that generate Ltn1 substrates. Splitting of ribosomal subunits during ribosome-associated QC in previous studies was attributed to the complex of the proteins Dom34 and Hbs1. Specifically, Dom34-Hbs1 was shown to promote separation of ribosomal subunits and drop-off of short peptidyl-tRNAs in an in vitro yeast translation system (6). Efficient splitting of ribosomes stalled on truncated mRNA sequences has been also demonstrated for the mammalian homologs of Dom34-Hbs1, Pelota-Hbs1 (7,40). However, the extent to which Dom34-Hbs1 contribute to the total pool of ubiquitinated NCs in cells, and specifically to Ltn1 substrates, is not known. To address this, we made a P TET-O7 -CDC48 dom34\u0394 strain and analyzed the distribution of ubiquitinated NCs in ribosomal fractions after Cdc48 depletion. Surprisingly, deletion of DOM34 had only a modest effect on the relative level and distribution of ubiquitin conjugates, with significant accumulation still observed in the 60S fraction (Figure 2, middle; Supplementary Figure S2A). Introduction of an additional ltn1\u0394 deletion into the P TET-O7 -CDC48 dom34\u0394 strain abolished accumulation of the ubiquitin signal in the 60S fraction, confirming that ubiquitination of the 60S\u2022NC complexes in these cells was still dependent on Ltn1 (Figure 2, right; Supplementary Figure S2A). The unexpectedly minor impact of Dom34 on the accumulation of ubiquitinated 60S\u2022NC com-plexes raised the possibility that additional factors may exist in cells to effect the splitting of ribosomes and generate substrates for the Ltn1-Cdc48 pathway.",

            "text": "Dom34 and Hbs1 are structurally related to the canonical release factors Sup45 and Sup35 (termed eRF1 and eRF3 in other species). Recently, the Sup45-Sup35 complex has been shown to mediate premature translation termination on polylysine-containing luciferase reporters (28), prompting us to test the role of these factors in the generation of substrates for Ltn1 and Cdc48. We had to use partial depletion strategies since both SUP35 and SUP45 are essential. First, we used an established approach based on the partial inactivation of the endogenous Sup45-Sup35 complex via sequestration into prion-like aggregates of Sup35. These aggregates are formed with high efficiency when fullsized Sup35 is overproduced in cells bearing a prion form of another protein, Rnq1 (44)(45)(46)(47)(48). To generate Sup35 aggregates, we first overexpressed full-length Sup35 from the GAL1 promoter in P TET-O7 -CDC48 cells. As a control, we used overexpression of Sup35-N that lacks the N-terminal prion-domain responsible for aggregate formation but retains the ability to interact with Sup45 and act as a translation termination factor (49,50). As expected, galactoseinduced expression of the full-length Sup35 led to the efficient formation of the high molecular weight aggregates of Sup35 ( Figure 3A). Analysis of the ribosomal fractions in these cells (Figure 3B, middle; Supplementary Figure  S2B) revealed a significant drop in the level of ubiquitinated products in the 60S fraction 3 and an altered accumulation pattern in the 60/80S fraction 4 and 80S fraction 5. In the control cells expressing Sup35-N, aggregates failed to form ( Figure 3A) and the distribution of the ubiquitinated species between the 60S and 80S fractions was similar to the empty-vector control ( Figure 3B, right and left; Supplementary Figure S2B). To better understand the pattern of ubiquitination in the intermediate fraction 4, which contains both 60S and 80S ribosomes, we lowered concentration of sucrose in gradients and collected fractions of a smaller volume ( Figure 3C). The improved separation of the 60S and 80S fractions confirmed a significantly lowered amount of 60S-associated ubiquitinated polypeptides in cells with aggregated Sup35 (compare fractions 4 and 5 between different panels in Figure 3C).",

Reduced activity of Sup35 in the newly generated sup35-R15 strain resulted in a temperature sensitive growth phenotype (Supplementary Figure S3) that was rescued by expression of the translationally active Sup35-N ( Figure 4A). We examined the distribution of ubiquitinated NCs across ribosomal fractions in the sup35-R15 strain and its parental wild-type strain after shifting these cells from 25 \u2022 C to a semi-permissive temperature (30 \u2022 C) for 4 h ( Figure 4B). We found that the ubiquitin signal in the 60S fraction was greatly reduced compared to wild-type cells, although these cells continued to display the robust accumulation of ubiquitinated 80S complexes, resembling the effect of the ltn1\u0394 deletion (compare Figure  4B, right with Figure 1C). The accumulation of ubiquitinated products in the 60S fraction was restored when the translationally competent Sup35-N was supplied by expression from a plasmid ( Figure 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that the translational activity of the canonical release factors gives rise to a substantial portion of Ltn1modified NCs.",

            "text": "During canonical translation termination, the release factor complex Sup45-Sup35 promotes the cleavage of tRNAs from NCs (51,52). In contrast, the splitting of ribosomal subunits by the release-like factors Dom34-Hbs1 occurs without accompanying peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis (6) since Dom34 lacks the GGQ motif required for catalysis (53,54). Previous biochemical and cryo-electron microscopy studies obtained with model substrates revealed the presence of peptidyl-tRNA in 60S subunits in cells harboring either a temperature-sensitive cdc48-3 allele (4) or catalytically inactive Ltn1 (11,13). Recent studies have shown that the exposed tRNA moiety in tRNA-linked 60S\u2022NC species can interact with Rqc2 (11,13), which, along with Ltn1, is part of the RQC complex (2,10). Considering the possibility that Sup45-Sup35 can also generate Ltn1 substrates (Figures 3  and 4), we wondered to what extent peptidyl-tRNAs contribute to the total pool of the ubiquitinated species associating with 60S ribosomal complexes. To address this, we examined sedimentation profiles of tRNAs after treating individual ribosome-containing gradient fractions with pro-teinase K, which hydrolyzes the ester bond between tRNAs and the conjugated peptides (55). We determined the relative amounts of four different elongator tRNAs (tRNA Glu , tRNA Leu , tRNA Val , tRNA Thr ) in each gradient fraction by quantitative northern hybridizations. By comparing tRNA distributions in different strains ( Figure 5A-B, Supplementary Figure S4), we were able to observe a decrease in elongator tRNA amounts associated with polysomes (fractions 6-10) after Cdc48 depletion, expected from partially repressed translation in these cells, and increase in polysomeassociated tRNAs in dom34\u0394 cells, as was previously described (56). Remarkably, the tRNA distribution data indicated a significant increase in the amount of elongator tRNAs in the 60S fraction 3 in Cdc48-depleted cells relative to wild-type cells ( Figure 5B, Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 2 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) and in fraction 4 containing 60S and 80S (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). In contrast to the elongator tRNA species, we did not observe a similar enrichment in the parallel analysis of the initiator tRNA Met i , which is not present in peptidyl-tRNAs ( Figure 5A and B, Supplementary Figure S4A). We also observed enrichment in elongator tRNAs in the 60S fraction 3 in ltn1\u0394 cells (Supplementary Figure S4B; Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ), although this effect was less pronounced than in Cdc48-depleted cells.",

Hybridization with a radioactively labeled tRNA probe revealed the increased quantities of peptidyl-tRNAs in the 60S complexes isolated from Cdc48-depleted, but not wild-type cells ( Figure 5C). Treatment of the peptidyl-tRNAs with a phenol-containing reagent prior to electrophoresis selectively removed the top part of the smear of peptidyl-tRNAs ( Figure 5C), consistent with the property of tRNAs conjugated to peptide chains longer then 80 residues to partition to the organic phase (36). Together with the gradient tRNA distribution analysis ( Figure 5A and B, Supplementary Figure S4), these results support the   . Enrichment of elongator tRNAs in 60S fractions in Cdc48-depleted cells depends on Dom34. We treated individual ribosome-containing sucrose gradient fractions with proteinase K to separate tRNAs from the conjugated peptides. Next, the extracted RNAs were sequentially analyzed by northern hybridization of the same membrane with probes that detect tRNA Met i , tRNA Glu , tRNA Leu , tRNA Val , tRNA Thr . The 18S and 25S rRNAs were analyzed on all membranes to verify alignment of the gradient fractions. (A) A representative example of the distribution of rRNA and tRNAs in gradient fractions is shown; see Supplementary Figure S4 for full hybridization sets. (B) The percentage of tRNAs in each fraction relative to the total was determined using phosphorimager quantification of the hybridization signals. The floating bars represent the full range of values obtained in each fraction (min to max) and the crossing lines indicate the mean. Four elongator tRNAs (top) or tRNA Met i (bottom) were quantified in gradients prepared from 2 biological replicates of wild-type cells, 3 replicates of P TET-O7 -CDC48 and three replicates of dom34\u0394 P TET-O7 -CDC48 cells. (C) RNA in ribosomes pelleted from the 60S gradient fractions of the indicated strains was resolved on an acid-urea polyacrilamide gel and analyzed by northern hybridization using a radioactively labeled probe against tRNA Leu . Treatment with phenol ('+') was used to selectively remove long peptidyl-tRNAs. Prior to hybridization, the membrane was stained with methylene blue (MB) to control loading by visualizing 5S and 5.8S rRNAs in the 60S subunits. XC, the xylene cyanol band.  Figure 1.

            "text": "If Dom34 is responsible for the generation of tRNAlinked NCs, as suggested by previous studies (6,7), its lack in the cell should abolish accumulation of elongator tRNAs in the 60S fraction. As predicted, introducing a dom34\u0394 deletion into P TET-O7 -CDC48 cells prevented the increase in elongator tRNAs in fractions 3 and 4 after Cdc48 depletion ( Figure 5A-B, Supplementary Figure S4A; Wilcoxon rank sum test, P < 1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ). However, as shown above, the western blot analysis of the gradient fractions indicates that large amounts of ubiquitin conjugates continue to accumulate in the 60S fraction in dom34\u0394 cells (Figure 2). We confirmed that accumulation of 60S-associated ubiquitinated species also occurred in hbs1\u0394 cells after Cdc48 depletion ( Figure 6A), even though like in dom34\u0394 cells, elongator tRNAs did not accumulate in the 60S fraction in hbs1\u0394 cells (Supplementary Figure S4C). These data are consistent with the idea that many 60S\u2022NC complexes targeted for Ltn1-Cdc48-mediated degradation do not contain tRNA. To further substantiate this result, we evaluated how much the total ubiquitination of the 60S\u2022NC complexes depends on Rqc2, which binds to the tRNA in 60S\u2022NC-tRNA complexes (12,13). We reasoned that if most Ltn1 substrates in the cell are derived from Sup45-Sup35 activ-ities, Rqc2 would be expected to impact a relatively minor pool of 60S\u2022NC-tRNA species that are products of Dom34-Hbs1. Indeed, the distribution of ubiquitinated NCs in the rqc2\u0394 P TET-O7 -CDC48 strain was virtually unaffected relative to the parental P TET-O7 -CDC48 strain ( Figure 6B, left), whereas the ltn1\u0394 rqc2\u0394 double deletion abolished the formation of ubiquitinated 60S species ( Figure 6B, right).",

In this work, we took a different approach by examining the total population of ubiquitinated nascent polypeptide chains associated with different ribosomal complexes. We made use of the observation that deficiency of Cdc48 results in the accumulation of the ubiquitin-labeled proteome in cells (57), including polypeptides that are modified cotranslationally (4), to assess upstream steps in ribosomeassociated degradation. In agreement with prior work utilizing translation reporters, our data indicate that the E3 ligase Ltn1 carries out most, if not all 60S-associated substrate ubiquitination in yeast cells. Importantly, our results establish that Dom34-Hbs1 are not the only factors responsible for generating Ltn1-Cdc48 substrates. Rather, our data point to the canonical release factors Sup45-Sup35 as the important mediators in ribosome-associated degradation that supply the bulk of 60S\u2022NC substrates for Ltn1 ( Figure  7).",

Recent studies of model stalling substrates have suggested that Sup35-Sup45 can terminate translation at internal polylysine segments (28). By contrast, Dom34 targets ribosomes arrested on truncated mRNAs and near the ends of 3 UTRs, but does not appear to facilitate the splitting of ribosomes on several types of coding sequences known to cause stalling (26,58). Consistently, recent in vitro studies (7,8), supported by structural data (59), revealed that subunit dissociation by Dom34-Hbs1 requires a short length of the mRNA's 3 extension relative to the codon in the P-site, 23 and 9 nucleotides for yeast and human Dom34-Hbs1, respectively. Thus, one possibility is that Dom34-Hbs1 evolved to recognize a specific type of substrates that cannot be efficiently resolved through canonical release factors, such as ribosomes reaching the 3 end of nonstop messages or inactive 80S ribosomes (60,25). The existence of alternative mechanisms to resolve translational stalls may explain why DOM34 and HBS1 are nonessential in yeast, unlike the key components of the translation rescue systems in bacteria (61).",

It was recently shown that tRNA in these complexes recruits Rqc2, which promotes synthesis of nontemplated C-terminal extensions of NCs (CAT tails), required for the transmission of the translation-stress signal to Hsf1 (10,13). Because cotranslational clearance of misfolded peptides and rescue of stalled ribosomes is a process that must take place in cells at all times, some way to avoid continuous translation-stress signaling in clearly needed. A plausible scenario consistent with our data is that most of the 'routine' clearance of aberrant NCs is performed by the release factors and accompanied by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, thereby carrying no intrinsic proteotoxic signaling function. This could also explain why mutations in tRNAinteracting residues of Rqc2 (13) or rqc2\u0394 deletion only weakly affect the clearance of model reporters (10) and recruitment of Cdc48 to 60S\u2022NC complexes (2).",

            "text": "Considering that the canonical release factors are capable of efficiently discriminating against sense codons under normal circumstances (6,62), an important question for the future studies is whether these factors function in QC by mediating detection of aberrant translation events such as ribosome slippage, which could lead to termination on premature stop codons, or their function involves a previously uncharacterized type of interactions with ribosomes, distinct from conventional termination. Intriguingly, there is prior evidence that Sup45-Sup35 may be capable of binding to stalled ribosomal complexes that contain a sense codon in the A site (63,64,28). Another interesting question concerns the activity of Ltn1 on 60S\u2022NC substrates in the absence of tRNA or Rqc2. Given the highly flexible structure of Ltn1 (65), this ubiquitin ligase could have additional modes of interaction with ribosomal complexes in addition to the previously observed conformation in cryo-EM structures in which its N-terminus contacts Rqc2 at the subunit interface (11)(12)(13). Indeed, previous in vitro studies of these proteins' mammalian homologs suggest that Ltn1-mediated ubiquitination of aberrant translation products may occur, albeit with reduced efficiency, without Rqc2 (40).",

            "text": "An unconventional activity of Sup45-Sup35 on stalled ribosomes may also have ramifications for gene expression. The switches between soluble and aggregated [PSI + ] prion states of Sup35 impart complex phenotypes, which have been attributed mainly to altered read-through of stop codons, but it is clear now that the full spectrum of the observed effects cannot be fully accounted for by this mechanism (66)(67)(68). We suggest that deficiency in functional Sup45-Sup35 conferred by [PSI + ] elements or conditions that affect Sup35 aggregation such as aging and heat stress (69,70) may lead to changes in the proteome via increased synthesis of proteins with built-in elongation stalling sites. This could serve as a regulatory mechanism contributing to survival under unfavorable conditions. Additionally, environmental insults that induce ribosome stalling might elicit differential responses depending on whether the release factors are available to trigger premature termination on selected mRNAs, with the subsequent destruction of the partially synthesized polypeptides via the Ltn1-Cdc48 pathway.",
