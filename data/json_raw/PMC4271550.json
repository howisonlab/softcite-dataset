            "text": "The core human gut microbiota contributes to the developmental origin of diseases by modifying metabolic pathways. To evaluate the predominant microbiota as an epigenetic modifier, we classified 8 pregnant women into two groups based on their dominant microbiota, i.e., Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Deep sequencing of DNA methylomes revealed a clear association between bacterial predominance and epigenetic profiles. The genes with differentially methylated promoters in the group in which Firmicutes was dominant were linked to risk of disease, predominantly to cardiovascular disease and specifically to lipid metabolism, obesity, and the inflammatory response. This is one of the first studies that highlights the association of the predominant bacterial phyla in the gut with methylation patterns. Further longitudinal and in-depth studies targeting individual microbial species or metabolites are recommended to give us a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of such epigenetic modifications."

The gut microbiota has an important role in human metabolism and could be a significant environmental factor affecting our epigenome. To investigate the association of gut microbiota with epigenetic changes, we assessed pregnant women and selected the participants based on their predominant gut microbiota for a study on their postpartum methylation profile. Intriguingly, we found that blood DNA methylation patterns were associated with gut microbiota profiles. The gut microbiota profiles, with either Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes as a dominant group, correlated with differential methylation status of gene promoters functionally associated with cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, differential methylation of gene promoters linked to lipid metabolism and obesity was observed. For the first time, we report here a position of the predominant gut microbiota in epigenetic profiling, suggesting one potential mechanism in obesity with comorbidities, if proven in further in-depth studies."

Small shifts in microbial composition may modify energy intake in a way that leads to weight gain and, later, to insulin insensitivity. For instance, the abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes can be highly biased in cases of obesity (1), diabetes (2), and cardiovascular risk factors (3). The molecular mechanism controlling these metabolic alterations has been related to effects on glucose absorption, generation of fatty acids, hepatic lipogenesis, and deposition of triglycerides in adipocytes (4).",

Recent reports suggest that the microbiota and its metabolites influence genomic reprogramming (5-7). For example, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Eubacterium rectale/Roseburia spp., which belong to the Firmicutes, are major contributors of butyrate, which regulates gene expression by histone modifications (5). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is another microbial factor that may have a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of immune and intestinal cells (8). LPS, widely recognized as an inflammatory molecule, acts as risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (9). There are various molecules of microbial origin that are in complex interplay with host metabolism and physiology. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies in human subjects that have correlated the microbiota and epigenetic modifications. As a first step, we compared the fecal microbiota composition to blood DNA methylation patterns in 8 subjects (body mass index of \u054525).",

In addition, differentially methylated genes were enriched in other functional networks, including the inflammatory response, metabolic pathways, and diseases like cancer, mostly affecting the gastrointestinal system (312 molecules, P \u03fd 0.05). As the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio was associated with obesity-related comorbidities, the cardiovascular disease risk network was further expanded, and associations with lipid metabolism (72 genes), in-flammatory response (85 altered genes), and obesity (23 altered genes) were found (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these results, the gene SCD5, which had the greatest difference between the two groups (fold change, 6.239; P \u03ed 0.00005), encodes primatespecific stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase, which has a key function in the catalysis of monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids.
