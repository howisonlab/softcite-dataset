Some cell lines fail to yield terminally differentiated cells at subsequent stages of differentiation (Tabar and Studer, 2014). These limitations in the ability to systematically differentiate hPSC lines into desired lineages substantially restrict their utility for cell replacement therapy and disease modeling, as moving stem cell-based therapies to patients will require the ability to differentiate all cell lines.",

Importantly, the PP1 treatment yields high differentiation efficiencies even in cell lines that have low differentiation propensities under control conditions. We demonstrate these effects in both human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Furthermore, we show that Src plays an important regulatory role in this process, as genetic suppression of Src regulates Rb activity and enhances the differentiation potential of hPSCs."

            "text": "Our focus on PP1 and Src was motivated by the finding that the embryonic cell cycle lengthens to incorporate gap phases as it transitions from a proliferative stage to a stage governed by cell fate decisions (Trelstad et al., 1967;Hartwell and Weinert, 1989;Murray and Kirschner, 1989;Frederick and Andrews, 1994;Edgar and Lehner, 1996). One mechanism that plays a critical role in maintaining cell proliferation at the early developmental stages is Src tyrosine kinase signaling (Frame, 2002;Segawa et al., 2006;Kim et al., 2009). High protein tyrosine kinase activity is required for the early developmental events that occur before cell fate specification (Imamoto and Soriano, 1993;Livingston et al., 1998). Analogous to early development, Src activity is elevated in proliferating PSCs (Anner\u00e9n et al., 2004), potentially preventing the lengthening of the cell cycle for differentiation and cell fate specification. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting Src activity might regulate the cell cycle and improve the differentiation propensity of hPSCs.",

We show that a potent Src inhibitor, PP1, regulates expression of genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, activates proteins in the retinoblastoma family, and subsequently increases the differentiation propensities of hPSCs into all three germ layers. We further demonstrate that genetic suppression of Src regulates the activity of the retinoblastoma protein and enhances the differentiation potential of hPSCs across all germ layers.

In most cell types, Src is negatively regulated (held in an inactive state), but in PSCs and cancer cells, Src activity is elevated (Frame, 2002;Anner\u00e9n et al., 2004). PP1 ( Fig. 1 A) has been shown to effectively block Src activity and the proliferation of many types of tumorigenic cells (Hanke et al., 1996;Bain et al., 2007). We tested whether inhibition of Src signaling by PP1 treatment affects the differentiation capacity of hPSCs. We focused on the hPSC line HUES6, a cell line with a 24-h doubling time that does not exhibit bias toward any particular lineage and is representative of cell lines with relatively low efficiencies of differentiation (Cowan et al., 2004;Osafune et al., 2008;Bock et al., 2011). To enhance therapeutic utility, differenti-ations were performed under low-serum conditions. After a 24-h treatment with PP1 at different doses, HUES6 cells were cultured in differentiation media with Wnt3a and Activin A for 24 h, then assessed for the percentage of cells that differentiated into Brachyury (Brachy)+ cells, a marker for mesendoderm and an early marker for differentiation ( Fig. 1 B).",

We assessed the phosphorylation status of Rb in control and 25 \u00b5M PP1-treated hPSCs. After a 24-h PP1 treatment, the percentage of hPSCs expressing hypophosphorylated Rb increased by >60-fold from 0.3% to 20% (Fig. 4, C and D). Phosphorylation of Rb occurs at 16 distinct sites (Harbour and Dean, 2000). Assessment of the inactive phosphorylated status of Rb at one of these sites (serine 780) showed that PP1 treatment leads to a twofold reduction in the percentage of cells expressing pRb780 (Fig. 4, C and E). The phosphorylation of Rb at serine 780 was also differentially regulated by other cell cycle inhibitors (Fig. S2 J).",

            "text": "In its hypophosphorylated state, Rb plays a critical role in growth suppression. In coordination with Rb, the retinoblastoma-associated protein 46/48 (RbAP46/48; a histone chaperone protein) regulates the cell cycle by aiding in the transcriptional repression of Rb-related target genes, particularly genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition (Harbour and Dean, 2000;Taylor-Harding et al., 2004). We assessed the fraction of cells expressing the cofactor RbAP46/48 in control and PP1-treated hPSCs. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of hPSCs expressing RbAP46/48 nearly doubles between control and PP1-treated cells (Fig. 4, F and G). Furthermore, treatment with 25 \u00b5M PP1 for 24 h also regulated the expression of many genes associated with cell cycle control. The expression of genes promoting cell division, including Cyclin A1, Cdk2, and Cdc6, were significantly reduced in PP1-treated hPSCs relative to control cells ( Fig. 4 H). Expression of p27, a cell cycle inhibitor that promotes growth arrest in G1 (Toyoshima and Hunter, 1994), was significantly increased in PP1-treated hPSCs compared with control cells (Fig. 4 H). No significant difference in expression levels was observed for Cyclin A2, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1, E2f1, and p21 between control and PP1-treated hPSCs (Fig. 4 H). Together, these results show that PP1 treatment of hPSCs promotes growth inhibition and an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase by regulating genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition. The enhanced hypophosphorylated state of Rb increases the proportion of cells in the early G1 phase and more generally indicates an increased presence of early G1 in the hPSC cycle after PP1 treatment.",

Western blot analysis using two different Src specific antibodies showed that PP1 treatment does indeed suppress Src levels (Fig. 5 A). To investigate whether suppression of Src mimics the effects of PP1 on hPSCs, we next genetically suppressed Src in hPSCs using siRNA. siR-NA-mediated knockdown of Src suppressed both the gene expression ( Fig. 5 B) and protein ( Fig. 5 C) levels of Src in hPSCs. Similar to PP1, Src knockdown also enhanced the activity of Rb by substantially reducing the levels of the phosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms of the Rb protein (ppRb) and increasing levels of the hypo-or underphosphorylated forms of Rb (Fig. 5 C). Together with PP1, these results provide further support that inhibition of Src increases the proportion of hPSCs in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle.",

            "text": "Prior literature has shown that cells have an enhanced capacity to respond to extracellular signals in the G1 phase (Scott et al., 1982). To investigate whether these effects regulate the differentiation propensity of hPSCs, we next assessed whether genetic suppression of Src improves the differentiation potential of hPSCs across all germ layers. After Src knockdown of hPSCs with siRNA, we subsequently induced differentiation into each of the germ layers using three different directed differentiation protocols (Chetty et al., 2013;Fig. 5 D). The percentage of cells becoming Sox1+, Brachy+, and Sox17+ cells was quantified to assess multilineage differentiation potential into the ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal germ layers, respectively (Fig. 5 D). Transfection of hPSCs with Src siRNA before directed differentiation significantly increased the number and percentage of differentiated cells across all three germ layers (Fig. 5, E and F). After Src knockdown, the percentage of hPSCs that differentiated into each germ layer was enhanced by \u223c2-10-fold ( Fig. 5 F). At the time points assessed, differentiation rates of \u223c50% were observed across all the germ layers after Src knockdown (Fig. 5 F). While Src knockdown promoted aggregation of cells initially, the cells spread out more rapidly after differentiation compared with the PP1 treatment. The suppression of the protein expression of Src was also reduced to a greater degree in PP1-treated cultures compared with genetic suppression of Src, potentially due to variations in potency and/ or technical limitations of using siRNA (Fig. 5, A and C).",

Three published directed differentiation protocols were used to differentiate hPSCs into representative populations of the ectodermal (dEC), mesodermal (dME), and endodermal (dEN) germ layers (Gifford et al., 2013; Fig. 6 A). The expression levels of a panel of genes specific to pluripotent stem cells and the three germ layers were measured in control and PP1-treated hPSCs and differentiated cultures. For most germ layer markers, higher expression levels were observed in PP1-treated differentiated cells compared with controls ( Fig. 6 B). The mean expression across all ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal markers on the panel was also significantly higher in PP1-treated differentiated cells relative to controls (Fig. 6 B, right bars). These differences were generally not present in PP1-treated and control hPSCs before directed differentiation (Fig. S4 D). In comparison to a reference set of 14 other pluripotent stem cell lines, the PP1treated differentiated cells had a higher germ layer differentiation potential than control samples (Fig. S4, E and F) and often had higher potential than other cell lines in the reference set.",

To evaluate the long-term effects of PP1, hPSCs were differentiated through a 15-d directed differentiation protocol into Pdx1+ pancreatic progenitor cells after the initial 24-h 25 \u00b5M PP1 treatment (Fig. 6 C). The PP1 treatment of hPSCs increased the number of Pdx1+ cells by threefold, inducing a 70% differentiation rate (Fig. 6, D and E). The PP1-treated cells also continued to expand throughout the stages of the directed differentiation protocol (Fig. 6 F). Further differentiation of the PP1-treated hPSCs toward terminally differentiated cells of the pancreatic lineage (Fig. S5 A) promoted differentiation into Nkx6.1+ and Ngn3+ endocrine cells as well as hormone-expressing C-peptide+ cells (Fig. S5 B). Thus, the increased differentiation efficiency after PP1 treatment is sustained throughout subsequent stages of differentiation and shows that the PP1 treatment is capable of driving hPSCs past the initial germ layers toward later stages of development.",

A 24-h treatment with PP1 modulates the expression of genes involved in the G1 to S phase transition, enhances Rb activity, and increases the percent of cells in the early G1 phase of the cell cycle. After these effects, hPSCs respond more efficiently and effectively to various directed differentiation protocols, leading to improvements in differentiation potentials across all germ layers. Genetic suppression of Src in hPSCs similarly activates Rb and improves differentiation capacity, suggesting an important role for Src in controlling proliferation and differentiation. These early manipulations of the starting state of hPSCs increase the output and specificity of differentiated cells at subsequent stages. The PP1 treatment enhances the yield of differentiated cells to 80% even in cell lines that would otherwise have low differentiation propensities. In cases where efficiencies are already high under control conditions, PP1 has no adverse effects. Thus, the effects are durable in that they extend beyond the initial germ layer specification."

In early development as well as in pluripotent stem cells, a truncated cell cycle initially supports the amplification of cells (Smith, 2001;Orford and Scadden, 2008). However, the cell cycle then lengthens as development progresses to incorporate gap phases and give cells the opportunity to become more specialized (Trelstad et al., 1967;Hartwell and Weinert, 1989;Murray and Kirschner, 1989;Frederick and Andrews, 1994;Edgar and Lehner, 1996). Similarly, lengthening the truncated cell cycle of pluripotent stem cells through suppression of Src or small molecules such as PP1 may help direct their differentiation into specialized cell types.",

Our findings also support recent work suggesting that the G1 phase of the cell cycle may play an important role in enhancing the differentiation of hPSCs (Sela et al., 2012;Pauklin and Vallier, 2013;Singh et al., 2013). Given its role in regulating Rb and the cell cycle, PP1 could also be a useful tool in controlling the tumorigenicity of pluripotent stem cells and their differentiated progeny to enhance their therapeutic utility (Ben-David and Benvenisty, 2011).",
