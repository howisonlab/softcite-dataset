We contribute to the literature by evaluating the impact of smoking bans on well-being externalities among smokers and non-smokers as well as couples of different types of smokers. We exploit the policy experiment provided by the timing of the UK public smoking bans and measure well-being via the GHQ. We employ matching techniques combined with flexible differencein-differences fixed effects panel data models on data from the British Household Panel Survey. The joint use of matching with fixed effects specifications allows building more comparable treatment and control groups, producing less modeldependent results and accounting for individual-level unobserved heterogeneity. We find that public smoking bans appear to have a statistically significant shortterm positive impact on the well-being of married individuals, especially among women with dependent children. These effects appear to be robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests and are discussed in the light of the economic theory and recent evidence.",

According to the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic (2013), smoking is directly linked to 6 million deaths every year worldwide. The 32nd Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health (US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014) finds that smoking increases the risk of cancer (e.g. lung, liver and colorectal cancers), respiratory infections [e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tuberculosis] and cardiovascular diseases. The same report also finds that women's risk of dying from smoking has tripled during the last 50 years and is now equal to men's risk; tobacco smoke causes 8 out of 10 cases of COPD; and maternal smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke reduces fertility and is linked to pregnancy complications, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome.",

            "text": "During the last two decades, tobacco control policies such as smoking bans and increases in excise taxes have been implemented with the aim of reducing the effects of both second-hand smoke (SHS) and cigarette consumption. A large body of empirical research has analysed the impact of anti-tobacco policies. These studies mainly focus on the effects of tobacco control interventions on passive smoking (Farrelly et al., 2005;Pearson et al., 2009); self-assessed health (Wildman and Hollingsworth, 2013;Kuehnle and Wunder, 2017); specific health conditions such as pulmonary disease (Menzies et al., 2006;Goodman et al., 2007) and myocardial infarction (Sargent et al., 2004;Seo and Torabi, 2007); as well as active smoking (cigarette consumption) (Anger et al., 2011;Jones et al., 2013). 1 Overall, these suggest that smoking bans appear to reduce both exposure to SHS and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, while also increasing general self-assessed health among non-smokers. However, their effects on tobacco consumption appear to be limited to specific population sub-groups such as individuals who often go to bars and restaurants or heavy smokers (Anger et al., 2011;Irvine and Nguyen, 2011;Jones et al., 2013). Although these papers focus on the direct consequences of anti-smoking policies on smoking behaviour and physical health, they do not appear to account explicitly for the presence of potential externalities on important measures of individual welfare such as subjective well-being (SWB). 2 Subjective well-being and its measurement are now central to public policy as a number of governments worldwide are increasingly concerned with the use of well-being measures to inform and appraise policy interventions (Dolan and Metcalfe, 2012). Expected potential gains and losses of SWB could be employed as an additional tool to rank policy options across different domains or aid the allocation of resources towards policies with the largest expected improvements in SWB relative to their costs (Dolan and White, 2007;Dolan and Metcalf, 2008).",

            "text": "2 A related strand of research has focused on the potential unintended consequences of anti-smoking interventions. Adams and Cotti (2008) found that in the US local and state public smoking bans may increase the risk of fatal car accidents due to drunk driving by leading smokers to drive longer distances to reach bars in neighbouring jurisdictions allowing them to smoke. Using biomarkers (cotinine) for tobacco intake, Adda and Cornaglia (2010) showed that by displacing smokers from public to private places, public smoking bans may increase the exposure to passive smoking of young children living with smokers. A subsequent study of Carpenter et al. (2011) employing self-reported data on smoking, however, found limited evidence of smoking bans causing displacement from public to private places. the introduction of smoking bans appear to present higher levels of life satisfaction. The author suggests that this may imply that current smokers are time-inconsistent and might benefit from anti-smoking policies. Odermatt and Stutzer (2015) used data from 40 European countries and also suggested that smokers who would like to quit smoking report higher levels of life satisfaction after the implementation of smoking bans. However, they do not find significant effects of smoking bans on SWB. Hinks and Katsaros (2010) employed UK data and found that smokers who reduce their intake of cigarettes after the ban report significantly lower levels of life satisfaction if compared to individuals who did not reduce their amount of tobacco intake (and smoked the same pre-ban amount of cigarettes). Leicester and Levell (2016) also exploited UK data and found that while tobacco excise taxes increase smokers' well-being, the impact of smoking bans appears to be weaker. Overall, these papers tend to overlook potential intra-household well-being externalities and appear to present conflicting results. 3 Furthermore, most of these studies do not appear to fully exploit the longitudinal nature of their data and do not explicitly account for the presence of individual-level unobserved heterogeneity.",

We find that the UK public smoking bans appear to have a positive and statistically significant short-term effect on the wellbeing of married individuals, especially among women with dependent children. These effects appear to be robust to alternative specifications and placebo tests.

            "text": "There are several potential mechanisms through which anti-smoking policies might have an impact on well-being. Standard economic models of tobacco consumption suggest that smoking decisions are the result of utility maximising behaviour. According to the seminal model of rational addiction (Becker and Murphy, 1988), smokers rationally maximise their utilities by trading off the long-run detrimental health effects with the immediate pleasure of smoking. Hence, this model appears to predict that smoking bans should decrease smokers' SWB by reducing the number of places in which they are allowed to smoke. The rational addiction model has also been extended to account for smokers' learning and regret (Leicester and Levell, 2016). For example, Jehiel and Lilico (2010) suggested that individuals may decide to smoke when young because of limited foresight and reduce or quit smoking once they have acquired a better foresight through learning as they age. However, this does not appear to fully explain why a number of adults may fail to give up smoking when they express a preference to do so or employ mechanisms to enhance self-control such as nicotine-replacement treatments (Amador and Nicol as, 2013).",

As a result, smokers might have decided to quit smoking and yet fail when they attempt to do so. In this case, smoking bans could act as a self-control device and potentially make smokers better off by helping them to quit smoking or reduce cigarette consumption Koszegi, 2000, 2002). This may imply that individuals could benefit from mechanisms of self-control that might help them reconciling the divergence between planned for and actual decisions. According to this interpretation, smoking bans could therefore increase SWB among smokers attempting to quit.",

According to Becker (1981), altruism is likely to dominate intra-family behaviours, and altruistic individuals derive utility from the well-being of other family members, including children. 4 Interestingly, smoking mothers are also found to be altruistic and to value their children's health more than their own (Agee and Crocker, 2007). Furthermore, some studies employ SWB to measure altruism within family and find that children's health and well-being have a positive impact on their parents' life satisfaction (e.g. Schwarze, 2004;Bruhin and Winkelmann, 2009). Therefore, in the presence of anti-smoking policies and despite their smoking status, altruistic parents might also experience an increase in SWB because of the potentially reduced exposure to second-hand smoke in public places of their children.",

Two identical comprehensive public smoking bans were introduced on 26 March 2006 in Scotland and 1 July 2007 in England. These were the first binding laws (i.e. before these bans no fines could be levied for smoking in public places) in the United Kingdom to forbid smoking in all enclosed public places such as pubs and restaurants and were enforced immediately after their introduction. In our data, the ban in Scotland was introduced between waves 15 and 16 of the BHPS, while the one in England between waves 16 and 17. 5 More specifically, we exploit the variation provided by the differential timing of the introduction of these policies in the BHPS to identify the impact of the Scottish ban on SWB. Accordingly, we make use of data up to wave 16 (collected between 1 September 2006 and 3 April 2007, i.e. before the English ban) in order to employ Scotland and England as treatment and control groups respectively, and prevent contamination of the control group. 6 The BHPS is a UK nationally representative panel survey that includes a wide range of variables on demographic and household characteristics, 5 Seven respondents were interviewed in wave 15 after the imposition of the Scottish ban (26 March 2006) and were removed from our sample while in wave 16 all individuals were interviewed before the implementation of ban in England (1 July 2007). Therefore, in our analysis, waves 15 and 16 represent the pre-and post-ban periods in Scotland respectively, whereas waves 16 and 17 are pre-and post-ban periods in England. Note that although other tobacco control policies have been recently introduced in the United Kingdom, they are unlikely to have an impact on this study as they were implemented after the time period considered in this study. For example, since 1 October 2007, it is illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 (previously 16) and picture warnings were introduced in October 2008 on cigarettes packs. As our analysis only employs data until 3 April 2007 and our sample solely includes respondents who are 18 years old or above, these policies do not appear to be able to influence our identification strategy. Furthermore, this policy experiment has been exploited before in the empirical literature, e.g. Adda et al. (2007Adda et al. ( , 2012 and Wildman and Hollingsworth (2013). 6 To be specific, we employ a sample of adult individuals from England and Scotland from wave 9 (1999) to wave 16 (2007). This is to exploit the additional sample of Scottish households included in wave 9. However, results based on the full set of waves are similar and available upon request.",

            "text": "We employ the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) to define individual SWB (Goldberg and Williams, 1988). The GHQ is a psychometrically validated and well-established measure of SWB that is often used in the economics literature (e.g. Clark and Oswald, 1994;Clark, 2003;Shields and Price, 2005;Oswald, 2006, 2007;Andersen, 2009;Binder and Coad, 2011). More specifically, the GHQ is a summary measure of psychological distress based on 12 questions concerning both positive and negative recent emotional experiences (Gardner and Oswald, 2007). 7 In this study, we use the GHQ measured on the Likert scale with values ranging from 0 to 36 (computed by taking the sum of the responses to the 12 questions and assigning values of 0 to the ones corresponding to the highest levels of well-being and 3 to the ones corresponding to lowest levels of well-being). The resulting measure is a summary index of well-being that is increasing in psychological distress: higher GHQ values correspond to lower levels of well-being. 8 As our main objective was to identify variations in well-being driven by smoking bans within a relatively short period of time, the use of the GHQ appears to be appropriate as it is often employed to define short-term fluctuations of emotional distress (for a discussion see Powdthavee and van den Berg, 2011). More general measures of 'total' or 'global' well-being such as life satisfaction might be less prone to detect temporary affective changes. 9 Furthermore, we exploit intra-couple information on well-being to define 7 The 12-item version includes questions on: concentration; loss of sleep; playing a useful role; being capable of making decisions; being constantly under strain; having problems overcoming difficulties; enjoying day-to-day activities; ability to face problems, unhappiness/depression; losing confidence; believing in self-worth; and general happiness. For each item/ question, respondents are asked to choose between four answers ranging from 1 to 4, with higher scores reflecting lower levels of well-being. Therefore, higher scores of the GHQ reflect lower levels of SWB. An example of the GHQ question is as follows: 'Have you recently been able to concentrate on whatever you're doing?' followed by the answers 'Better than usual (1)', 'same as usual (2)', 'less than usual (3)' and 'much less than usual (4)'. 8 We have also estimated models using the 12 items from the GHQ separately. Results are available upon request. 9 We have also considered the use of a measure of life satisfaction in an earlier version of the paper. However, this measure is only present in selected waves of the BHPS, leading to small sample sizes of treated individuals for most of the sub-samples employed in our analysis. This produced imprecise point estimates with large standard errors.",

For the purpose of our analysis, we define two types of individuals: potential smokers and never smokers. Potential smokers are individuals who report being a smoker at least once during the survey period (i.e. individuals who answered 'yes' to the question on smoking prevalence at least once). Never smokers are defined as individuals who always reported being non-smokers throughout the entire period of the survey. Our definition of potential smokers allows us to go beyond current smoking status that might be affected by the introduction of the smoking bans while also including individuals with a propensity to smoke. Robustness checks provide key results for alternative definitions of smokers. Table 1 presents summary statistics of the main variables in our analysis. These variables are presented for males and females separately. As our analysis will focus on the effects of smoking bans on intra-couple well-being externalities, descriptive statistics are both presented for the overall unmatched sample (i.e. married and single individuals together) and are broken down by marital status (married/living with a partner vs. unmarried/single). 11 Overall, there is a higher prevalence of smoking among men in all samples, especially among single men with an average of around 29%. Smoking intensity also appears to be larger among men with the highest mean value of daily number of cigarettes among married male individuals (16.5 cigarettes per day). Throughout all samples, women appear to present slightly lower levels of SWB (higher GHQ levels) if compared to men and the highest levels of 10 An earlier version of this paper included health status via self-assessed health and the presence of breathing and heart related problems.

We first employ standard two-way fixed effects models (2FE) using Scotland and England as treated and control groups respectively, and then use a more flexible model with fixed effects and country-specific time trends that allows for different policy effects by region and time.

An advantage of this combined approach is that it is 'doubly robust' in that under weak conditions (and excluding extreme cases where matching would lead to non-identification even when the subsequent parametric models are correctly specified) if either the matching or parametric models are correct, causal estimates should be consistent (Bickel and Kwon, 2001;Ho et al., 2007).",

Table 2 shows the reduction in bias on observables obtained through kernel matching based on the pre-treatment (smoking ban) wave (i.e. wave 15). The matched sample used for the subsequent empirical analysis includes 2220 individuals from Scotland and 6227 individuals from England. The first four columns present statistics based on the unmatched sample, while columns five to eight are based on the matched sample. The table displays mean values of each variable and provides standard t-test statistics to measure differences between mean values of the observables between treated and control groups. It appears that a number of variables are significantly different across treatment and control groups based on the unmatched sample (e.g. age, household size and income; employment status such as working in family care and being a student), while none of these covariates appear to show significant differences after the matching. This underlines that in this case kernel matching 12 Results based on nearest neighbour and Mahalanobis distance matching are similar and available upon request. Kernel matching builds the counterfactual outcome using weighted averages of all individuals in the control group, with higher weights being placed on the untreated individuals with scores closer to the treated. We impose common support condition and use a bandwidth of 0.01. We have also used alternative bandwidth values (e.g. 0.005, 0.0025 and 0.00125); however, in our case lower bandwidths lead to a smaller sample size and do not appear to improve the overall quality of the matching. Hence, we present our results based on a 0.01 bandwidth. While the results presented here are based on observations included in the pre-treatment wave (wave 15), we have also tested kernel matching using observations throughout waves 9-15. Results are virtually identical and available upon request. The last column reports the reduction in bias after the kernel matching.

Still for the overall population sample of men, SWB also appears to somewhat increase in England after the smoking ban. Graphs for married individuals of both genders (second row of Figure 1) appear to display GHQ trends comparable to the ones of the overall population. Single women in Scotland and England (third row of Figure 1) show virtually identical self-reported GHQ trends, also during the introduction of the two bans with slight increases in SWB between waves 15 and 16 (Scottish ban) followed by decreases in SWB between waves 16 and 17 (English ban). However, SWB reported by single men seem to vary during the pre-Scottish ban period, although only between GHQ scores of 10 and 11. Men and women with children (fourth row of Figure 1) exhibit relatively stable differences in GHQ levels between England and Scotland before the Scottish ban with increases in SWB during the Scottish ban and simultaneous slight decreases in England. However, the very stable GHQ levels 14 In this case, we use England in wave 9 as a baseline country-specific time trend as no public smoking ban was in place at that time. Treatment effects are computed using differences between estimated interaction terms, i.e. interactions between country of residence and time dummies, before and after the Scottish ban in England and Scotland. More specifically, the corresponding treatment effect reported in each table is the one obtained by the following double difference: (Scotland*wave 16 -England*wave 16) -(Scotland*wave 15 -England*wave 15) where waves 15 and 16 are the pre-and post-Scottish ban waves in the BHPS respectively. Standard errors for these treatment effects are obtained using the lincom command in Stata.",

            "text": "In order to examine whether there are any intra-couple well-being externalities driven by the public smoking bans, we first present estimates separately by gender (men vs. women), marital status (married/living with a partner vs. single) and smoking status (overall population, potential smokers and never smokers), see Table 3. Furthermore, to identify potential well-being externalities within couples of different types of smokers, we present estimates also broken down by the smoking status of spouses (whether spouses are potential smokers vs. spouses of never smokers), see Table 4, and whether these couples have cohabiting dependent children, see Table 5. Estimates of both 2FE and CSTT models are produced by combining kernel matching with DD linear fixed effects models. All treatments effects should be interpreted as point changes on the GHQ Likert scale. Table 3 displays estimates of the impact of the Scottish public smoking ban on well-being produced by 2FE and CSTT models. The majority of treatment effects for married men and women appear to be negative and statistically significant in both models. As lower GHQ scores correspond to higher levels of well-being, this suggests that the Scottish ban had a positive and statistically significant impact on the SWB of married individuals. For married male individuals (overall population, that is potential smokers and never smokers together), the ban led to a decrease in the GHQ (increase in well-being) of around between 0.4 and 0.5 points on the Likert scale (0.438, 2FE model, and 0.506, CSTT model at 5% significance level), while for married females (overall population) the decrease in the GHQ appears to be well-over half a point (between 0.543 and 0.708). The ban does not appear to have had a statistically significant effect among single men or women. Married male and female never smokers also appear to experience statistically significant increases in wellbeing (around 0.5 points and 0.46-0.80 points, respectively). Therefore, the ban appears to have led to an increase in well-being among married men and women, and larger impacts have been found among married individuals who are never smokers compared to those who are potential smokers. Table 4 reports treatment effects from 2FE and CSTT models broken down by gender, type of smokers and 'smoking type' of each spouse. We observe negative and statistically significant effects for both genders among the overall population and never smokers. Although presenting similar size and signs, treatments effects among potential smokers do not appear to be statistically significant. However, this may be partly due to the increased standard errors potentially driven by the relative small amount of observations available to estimate these models (especially the ones for women who are potential smokers and married/ living with a never smoker). The largest statistically significant improvements in well-being following the ban are observed among males who are never smokers and married/living with potential smokers (with a decrease of around 0.97 GHQ points and statistically significant at 5% level in the 2FE model) while, although sizeable (0.76-1.8 GHQ points), the effects for the corresponding female sub- Standard errors in parentheses.

Table 6 presents estimates on the impact of the Scottish ban on individuals who smoke throughout the survey (always smokers); respondents who report smoking at the time of the ban regardless of their previous smoking status (current smokers); as well as individuals who were smoking before the ban and quit smoking after the ban (quitters). These are broken down by gender and marital status and were produced using 2FE models. The ban appears to have increased SWB for women who are married and either always or current smokers, although the latter treatment effect is only weakly statistically significant. We find a larger and statistically significant increase in SWB (around 3.6 GHQ points) among married males who are quitters. As quitters are a sub-group of our potential smokers, this may imply that changes in SWB for male potential smokers who are married might be partly driven by the effects of quitters. However, it should be kept in mind that the sub-samples presented in this table are relatively limited if compared to the ones based on similar models which employ previous definitions of smokers (Table 3, which overall does not appear to present significant effects for men potential smokers). For this reason, we were not able to further disentangle treatment effects by spouses' smoking type. Table 7 shows results from placebo tests assuming that the Scottish ban was implemented in 2004 and 2005 (i.e. 2 and 1 year before its actual implementation respectively). These should further explore the robustness of our results as well as the presence of potential anticipation effects. Results are broken down by gender, type of smokers and marital status. Apart from weakly statistically significant coefficients for married men who are potential smokers and among married women who are never smokers, all remaining estimated treatment effects do not appear to be statistically different from zero. Furthermore, the direction of these effects appears to be undetermined with a mixture of positive and negative signs. This also seems to provide some further support to our main results.",

            "text": "married women with children while the same estimates for men do not appear to show notable improvements. As our models and data do not allow testing directly this hypothesis, we cannot exclude that these results may partly reflect broader gender based differences in reporting well-being. Furthermore, our robustness checks also find an increase in SWB among married males who are quitters, i.e. individuals who quit smoking after the introduction of the ban. This might suggest that the effects for this sub-sample of married men could be to some extent driven by the ban leading individuals to quit or reduce smoking also at home. This would be in line with the recent empirical literature indicating that public smoking bans may also increase the likelihood of voluntary smoking restrictions at home (e.g. Cheng et al., 2015) and the use of anti-smoking policies as self-control devices (e.g. Leicester and Levell, 2016). Overall, further research and larger datasets might be needed to more precisely establish the causal pathways leading to the observed increase in well-being following public smoking bans. Yet, our placebo tests, showing mainly insignificant changes whose direction is undetermined in the 2 years prior the introduction of the ban, appear to suggest that our findings should be mainly the result of the Scottish ban.",

In the medium and long-run, individuals could adapt to the presence of public smoking bans and as a result their reported wellbeing could also change over time. Although our estimated treatment effects on well-being appear to be non-negligible in size, we should be cautious in comparing them with the ones identified by previous studies (for instance those of important life events such as marriage and divorce on well-being, see Clark and Oswald, 2002;and Gardner and Oswald, 2007), also because of their transitory nature.",

From a policy perspective, while public smoking bans may have a limited effect on active smoking and some potential adverse effects on passive smoking (e.g. Adda and Cornaglia, 2010;Carpenter et al., 2011), they may also produce positive shortterm well-being externalities, especially among couples living with young children. This additional information could be exploited by governments concerned with the overall impact evaluation of their anti-smoking policies alongside standard findings on smoking prevalence and intensity.",
