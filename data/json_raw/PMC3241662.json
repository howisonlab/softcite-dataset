            "text": "SR proteins promote spliceosome formation by recognizing exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) during pre-mRNA splicing. Each SR protein binds diverse ESEs using strategies that are yet to be elucidated. Here, we show that the RNA-binding domain (RBD) of SRSF1 optimally binds to decameric purine rich ESE sequences although locations of purines are not stringently specified. The presence of uracils either within or outside of the recognition site is detrimental for binding with SRSF1. The entire RBD, comprised of two RRMs and a glycine-rich linker, is essential for ESE binding. Mutation within each segment reduced or nearly abolished binding, suggesting that these segments mediate cooperative binding. The linker plays a decisive role in organizing ESE binding. The flanking basic regions of the linker appear to communicate with each other in bringing the two RRMs close together to form the complex with RNA. Our study thus suggests semi-conservative adaptable interaction between ESE and SRSF1, and such binding mode is not only essential for the recognition of plethora of physiological ESE sequences but may also be essential for the interaction with various factors during the spliceosome assembly.",

            "text": "SRSF1, one of the SR proteins, contains two RRMs at its N-terminus and a relatively short RS domain at the C-terminus. The C-terminal RS domain plays a modulatory role in the SRSF1:ESE complex formation through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the serine residues (3). The N-terminal RRM-containing region is responsible for sequence-specific RNA binding. The more N-terminal RRM (RRM1) exhibits clear sequence similarity to the canonical RRM consensus by virtue of its RNP1 and RNP2 motifs. The RRM2 of SRSF1 lacks these motifs. SRSF1-specific ESE sequences have been determined by both binding affinity and functional SELEX experiments (4)(5)(6). In addition to selection based and physiological ESE identification, significant progress has been made in identifying ESEs from genome-wide sequences through the use of computational methods (7). All these studies suggest that SRSF1 binds a broad spectrum of ESEs with only a loose consensus among these sequences. ESE bound SRSF1 does not only active but also represses splicing. Other SR proteins also behave similarly as SRSF1 in terms of loose consensus for their respective ESEs and ability to both activate and repress splicing. The NMR solution structure of the single-RRM containing SR protein SRSF3 (SRp20) bound to a 4-nt ESE RNA demonstrated that SRSF3 recognizes the ESE in a semi-sequence specific manner by using conserved motifs and amino acid residues within its RRM (8). This mode of ESE recognition by SRSF3 provides some clues as to how numerous degenerate ESE sequences within various pre-mRNA might be recognized by SR proteins. RNA-bound structures of non-SR protein splicing factors, Sxl (9), U2AF65 (10), HuD (11) and PTB (12), have also been elucidated. In each case, the complex structure contains two RRMs bound to cognate RNA. These structures reveal diverse modes by which individual RRMs articulate with one another in recognizing specific target RNA. In one case, for example, each RRM of U2AF65 binds to a polypyrimidine tract independent of one another. In contrast, the two PTB RRMs recognize their target RNA as a single unit with extensive interdomain protein-protein contacts. The Sxl RRMs exhibit clear cooperativity in their binding to RNA. In all of these cases the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 motifs are directly involved in RNA recognition. The RNA recognition sequences of these splicing factors are highly specific in general. However, it is unclear how SR proteins with two RRMs bind to such a large and diverse collection of cognate sequences.",

We found that the protein optimally binds RNA sequences of 10-nt in length with no stringent position-specific base requirement with the exception of uracil. The presence of uracils both inside and outside of the recognition sequence is detrimental to binding. All three segments of SRSF1, RRM1, RRM2 and the linker are essential for ESE binding. The flexibly linked segments in SRSF1 RBD recognize RNA using cooperative interactions. Our result thus explains how SRSF1 binds to a large number of ESE to promote splicing.",

In order to investigate the specificity of these ESEs, we also tested binding of the SRSF1 RBD to mutated versions of each of these ESEs. The mutant Ron ESE used was tested previously and showed no splicing activity in cells while the naturally occurring BRCA1-ESE and SMN1-ESE mutants have been linked to disease ( Figure 1B) (14)(15)(16). A filter-binding (FB) assay was used to evaluate the protein: RNA-binding affinity ( Figure 1C). Of the three, the Ron ESE exhibited the highest affinity for SRSF1 RBD. However, binding affinity was moderate, measuring in the low micromolar range. The BRCA1 and SMN1 ESEs displayed weaker binding affinity. As expected, none of the three mutant ESEs showed any detectable binding ( Figure 1C).",

We found that the SRSF1 RBD exhibits modest binding to 5 0 -SS with an affinity that is similar to the SMN1 ESE ( Figure 1C). No interaction was observed when SRSF1 RBD binding to poly-U RNA was assayed as a control ( Figure 1C). As an alternative approach, we next ran electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to measure the binding affinity of the SRSF1 RBD for Ron ESE and the 5 0 -SS (17) (Supplementary Figure S2A and B). EMSA analysis revealed a similar binding pattern as the FB assay with the Ron ESE binding more strongly than 5 0 -SS to the SRSF1 RBD. Also in agreement with the FB assay results, the poly-U RNA failed to interact with the protein (Supplementary Figure S2C). Therefore, despite their relatively low affinity, SRSF1 RBD binds to ESEs with sequence specificity.",

Curiously, in vitro selection for ESEs based solely upon binding affinity identified octameric and decameric consensus sequences (4). To determine whether the SRSF1 RBD binds to RNA sequences that are heptameric or longer, we tested a 13-nt sequence that contained the 7-nt core Ron ESE at the center and uridines nucleotides in all the flanking positions as a 7-mer sequence cannot be efficiently radiolabeled (Figure 2A).

Initially, we tested five different RNA lengths: 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15-nt sequences ( Figure 2B). All of the RNA possessing 11 natural Ron ESE nucleotides or more bound SRSF1 RBD with similar affinities, whereas the 9-nt RNA bound only poorly. These results suggest that the minimal RNA length for native-like Ron ESE:SFRS1 RBD interactions might be 10 or 11 nt. To further define the length of recognition sequence, we generated ESE sequences by adding nucleotide(s) at the 5 0 -end or 3 0 -end of the 9-nt core to create 10L, 10R, 12L, 12R, 14L and 14R ( Figure 2C). Unexpectedly, both 10L and 10R bound the protein with similar affinities and these affinities are comparable to the longer RNA sequences. Sequence comparison of 10L and 10R shows that 6 of 10 positions are different (Figure 2A, bottom). This observation is consistent with the idea that none or only a few base positions within the recognition sequence are stringently fixed to mediate unique interactions with the protein. This mode of binding explains how SRSF1 can accommodate large number of ESE sequences to impose splicing regulation.",

This observation is further supported by the very low binding affinity of SMN1 and BRCA1 ESEs; both of which contain several Us. We further examined the role of uracils within and outside of the core Ron ESE sequence in complex formation with the SRSF1 RBD. Having established that a 10-nt sequence is required for full SRSF1 binding, we altered three flanking nucleotides of the 13-nt long Ron-ESE to U (3U) ( Figure 3A). Filter-binding assay revealed that the 3U mutant bound with lower affinity to SRSF1 RBD ( Figure 3B). Reduced binding by the addition of three Us flanking to the optimized 10-nt sequence suggested that indeed uracils play a negative role in the RNA:protein recognition process. It is well established that poly U sequences are highly flexible as uracils are unstacked compared to adenines in poly A ribonucleotide sequences, which undergo temperature-dependent unfolding (20). Therefore, the possible explanation for negative role of flanking uracils might arise due to the enhanced flexibility of the core RNA sequence in solution resulting in a greater entropic penalty for the complex formation.",

We altered position 1 to either A or U, and position 7 to either U or G and used FB assays to measure the binding affinities of these mutant ESEs for SRSF1. We found that, although the presence of U at either of these positions is detrimental to SRSF1 binding, the defect was more severe for U at position 7. Although these binding defects might be due to the loss of direct protein:RNA contact(s), or reduced ability of stacking interactions between the protein and uracils, it is also possible that a U at any position within the protein-binding region increases flexibility of ESE, which in turn negatively affects binding.

Neither R1 (SRSF1 residues 1-90), nor R2, showed any binding to ESE. LR2 (residues 90-196), but not R1L (1-118), showed partial binding ( Figure 4B; Supplementary Figure S3A and B). The respective binding affinities displayed by R1 and LR2 fragments defied the standard RNA-binding norms of RRM as R1, but not R2, contains the RNP motifs. However, the binding affinity of LR2 for ESE was significantly lower when compared to that exhibited by the SRSF1 RBD. Taken together, these results suggest that the linker converts R2 into a RNA-binding motif, and that R1 and LR2 mediate cooperative ESE binding.

To further elucidate the role of the SRSF1 linker region in ESE binding, we mutated several residues in both segments of the linker: R90A, R93A, R97A, R109A, R111A, Y112A, S116A, R117A/ R118A and S119A ( Figure 5A).

The R117A/R118A double mutant showed the most severe defect while both Y112A and S119A single mutants exhibited moderate binding. The remaining mutants showed varying degrees of weakened binding affinity.

As expected, wt RBD efficiently complemented splicing; however, none of the linker mutant tested showed any splicing ( Figure 5C). Next, we tested the effect of the F56D/F58D mutant that had been previously shown to be defective in splicing. As expected, this mutant failed to complement splicing in vitro.

To examine the role of RNP1 in R1, conserved RNP1 residues, F56 and F58, were mutated to aspartates and the double mutant was tested for ESE binding by FB assay. We found that the RBD (F56D/F58D) mutant binds Ron ESE poorly implicating the involvement of these two residues in cognate ESE binding ( Figure 6A). This result also explains why the F56D/F58D mutant impairs splicing (22,23). Intriguingly, the apparent binding affinity of this RBD mutant is comparable to that of the LR2 fragment suggesting that cooperation between R1 to the rest of the protein in ESE binding is mediated through its conserved RNP1 motif. We next investigated how residues in the R2 domain also participate in ESE binding. R2 domain does not contain consensus RNP motifs but it includes a conserved heptapeptide sequence SWQDLKD, which has been implicated in RNA binding (21). As indicated by the RRM2 structure, W134, Q135 and R154, all reside close to one another on the same positively charged face of R2 (21). Therefore, we hypothesized that this face might likely be involved in ESE recognition. Although R154A was not defective in ESE binding, the W134A and Q135A mutants exhibited highly defective in ESE binding ( Figure 6A). Dramatic defect in ESE binding by these two single mutants suggest cooperation between the protein segments in ESE recognition. Moreover, the involvement of four aromatic residues in ESE binding led us to propose that these residues might make stacking interactions as commonly observed in other RNA-protein complexes. To further test extensive nature of aromatic-RNA contacts, we mutated four other tyrosines (Y79A and Y82A in R1, Y149A and Y153A in R2) located in the same face as F56/F58 or W134. Tyrosine mutants in the R2 (Y149A and Y153A), but not in the R1, showed defects in ESE binding ( Figure 6B). This observation further emphasizes more significant role of the R2 in ESE binding.",

We hypothesized that the two ends of the linker separated by the central glycine-rich segment are involved in the R1-R2 cooperation. We have measured the binding of LR2 fragments to ESE both in the absence and presence of R1. An enhancement of ESE binding was observed when LR2 was mixed with R1 ( Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S3C-D). However, this enhancement was not observed when the N-terminal part of the linker was removed (LR2\u00c1N15) ( Figure 6C). To further test the coupling between the two segments of the linker, we created two double mutants one located in the N-terminal part (S91E/T95E) and the other in the C-terminal part of the linker. Both mutants were constructed in the context of the entire RBD . The S91E/T95E double mutant showed partial defect in ESE binding ( Figure 6D). S119A single mutant was highly defective in ESE binding ( Figure 5B), while S116E/S119E double mutant was only marginally defective ( Figure 6D). However, when both double mutants were combined (S91E/T95E/S116E/S119E), the resultant quadruple mutant showed no measurable binding affinity ( Figure 6D). That is, the defect is not additive but cooperative. Taken together these results suggest that the two end of the linker cooperate with each other in ESE binding and together they cooperate with the R2. Finally, this LR2-ESE subcomplex completes the binding process by recruiting the RNP1 motif of the R1 domain. Our model further highlights a novel extensive role played by a large linker in RNA binding.",

            "text": "SRSF1 regulates splicing by binding to a broad spectrum of ESE sequences. SELEX experiments in which selection was based either purely on binding or splicing (functional) activity identified significantly different SRSF1-specific RNA sequences: RGAAGAAC and AGGACRRAGC obtained through binding SELEX (4) and SRSASGA (S = C or G) by functional SELEX (5). Recent CLIP method identified an even more diverse consensus sequence for SRSF1 (UGRWG, R:purine; W:A/G) (24). Results presented here explain how diverse ESE sequences can be recognized: we show that the decameric ESE sequences, but not the shorter sequences as generally thought, are optimal for SRSF1 binding. Our finding that the 10th nucleotide can be added to the either end to obtain maximal binding affinity strongly points toward a semi-conservative binding mode since seven positions are different between these two sequences. A and G substitute each other in these differed positions. Since A and G are decorated with different functional groups and their hydrogen bonding capacity is different, we conclude that the complex formation is dominated by stacking interactions. Therefore, we suggest sequence-specific hydrogen bonding contacts between the protein and RNA might not be as distinctive a feature as the stacking interactions between bases and aromatic side chains. Purines are better suited for stacking than pyrimidines, this explains why SRSF1-specific ESEs are dominated by the purine residues. The presence of uracil both inside and flanking the recognition sequence is less permissible to SRSF1 binding. The presence of uracil destabilizes the complex, perhaps, due to its higher flexibility compared to other bases in the oligonucleotide and/or due to its reduced stacking interactions with the protein. The NMR solution structure of the single RRM-containing SR protein, SRSF3 (SRp20), bound to a 4-nt (CAUC) ESE shows interesting property of the complex: this structure shows protein bound to the RNA primarily through stacking interactions with only one base-specific hydrogen-bonding contact (8). However, the significance of this base-specific contact awaits Figure 7. Residues remote from the RNA-binding surface affect ESE recognition (A) The ribbon presentation of the RRM1 domain of SRSF1. The RNP1 residues F56 and F58 are shown in blue. Backbones of residues in four exposed surfaces are denoted by different colors (M1 (E68A/D69A; yellow), M2 (Y72A; gray), M3 (Y39E/Y77A; pink) and M4 (E62A/D63A/D66A; magenta). Additionally, side chains of two M3 residues are shown. (B) Filter-binding assay of His-tagged SRSF1 RBD wt and mutants, (M1, M2, M3 and M4) to Ron ESE of 13 nt. Error bars obtained from three independent experiments. The number in parenthesis denotes the apparent K d of binding. (C) GST pull-down assay was performed to examine the interaction between 10 mg wt GST-SRSF1 (R1) wt or four mutants (M1, M2, M3 and M4) and 15 mg His-SRSF1 (LR2) in each the presence of wt Ron ESE or mutant Ron ESE. As a control, GST protein was used instead of GST-SRSF1 (R1) with wt His-SRSF1 (LR2). SDS-PAGE was resolved in 12.5% acrylamide gel and stained by Coomassie blue. (D) In vitro splicing of the b-gb (Ron) pre-mRNA substrate using wt SRSF1-RBD and SRSF1-RBD containing M1, M2, M3a (Y39E), M3b (Y77A) and M4 mutants. An amount of 25 and 50 pmol S100 extracts were used for the splicing reactions. (E) A cartoon depicting the mechanism of ESE binding by SRSF1-RBD. In the absence of ESE, the linker domain of the SRSF1 is flexible and probably remains unstructured. However, in the presence of ESE, LR2 binds to ESE and then R1 makes contact to ESE. This binding mode brings R1 and LR2 adjacent each other. further investigation. Our results when considered through this structural study a novel RNA: protein recognition strategy can be predicted between SR proteins and ESE sequences. All three segments of the RBD; the linker and the RRMs are required for ESE binding. Most of the single or double mutations drastically reduced binding affinity suggesting that the RNA contacting residues are in a part of interaction network and recognize RNA in a cooperative manner. These observations suggest a novel ESE-binding mechanism by SRSF1 RBD where the distal protein segments assembles around the target RNA stabilize the protein-RNA complex through strongly cooperative intra-molecular protein-protein and inter-molecular protein-RNA contacts. Since the linker is flexible in natures, it can bind to a variety of sequences with low sequence specificity before properly orienting the RRMs to make specific and semi-specific contacts. In such a binding, protein-protein contact between the linker and RRM2 or RRM1 may contribute significant binding energy in forming the complex. This explains why so many single or double mutants practically abolish the complex formation. This coupled binding also explains how small variation in the linker can greatly inhibit the association process. For instance, the modification of the linker would greatly affect RNA binding. Indeed, it has been shown that methylation of arginines (R93, R97 and R109) impact on splicing (25). It is possible that phosphorylation of serines and threonine will reduce RNA binding and hence would negatively affect splicing.",
