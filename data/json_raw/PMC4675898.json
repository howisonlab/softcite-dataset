            "text": "[sucrose non-fermenting1-related kinase2] protein kinases and group A protein phosphatase type 2C (PP2C)-type phosphatases constitute the core ABA pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are also involved in plant response to ABA. However, little is known about the interplay between MAPKs and PP2Cs or SnRK2 in the regulation of ABA pathways. In this study, an effort was made to elucidate the role of MAP kinase kinase kinase18 (MKKK18) in relation to ABA signaling and response. The MKKK18 knockout lines showed more vigorous root growth, decreased abaxial stomatal index and increased stomatal aperture under normal growth conditions, compared with the control wild-type Columbia line. In addition to transcriptional regulation of the MKKK18 promoter by ABA, we demonstrated using in vitro and in vivo kinase assays that the kinase activity of MKKK18 was regulated by ABA. Analysis of the cellular localization of MKKK18 showed that the active kinase was targeted specifically to the nucleus. Notably, we identified abscisic acid insensitive 1 (ABI1) PP2C as a MKKK18-interacting protein, and demonstrated that ABI1 inhibited its activity. Using a cellfree degradation assay, we also established that MKKK18 was unstable and was degraded by the proteasome pathway. The rate of MKKK18 degradation was delayed in the ABI1 knockout line. Overall, we provide evidence that ABI1 regulates the activity and promotes proteasomal degradation of MKKK18."

            "text": "The phytohormone ABA recruits many diverse elements for the generation and transmission of endogenous signals (Xiong et al. 2002, Mane et al. 2007, Geiger et al. 2009, Ludwik\u00f3w et al. 2009, Santiago et al. 2009, Yoshida et al. 2010. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases are proteins that lead to rearrangements in the network of ABA signal transduction (Ohta et al. 2003, Zhu et al. 2007, Ma et al. 2009, Santiago et al. 2009, Nishimura et al. 2010, Szostkiewicz et al. 2010, Dupeux et al. 2011a, Dupeux et al. 2011b). Both protein kinases and protein phosphatases are obligatory for ABA signal transduction. Sucrose non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)related protein kinases 2 (SnRK2s), Ca 2+ -dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) and calcineurin B-like calcium sensor (CBL)interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) are all known for their involvement in ABA signaling and stress tolerance, and are identified as interacting partners with particular protein phosphatases type 2C (PP2Cs) (Ohta et al. 2003, Zhu et al. 2007. Key players of ABA signaling such as abscisic acid insensitive 1 (ABI1), abscisic acid insensitive 2 (ABI2) and Hypersensitive to Abscisic acid 1 (HAB1) have been shown to interact with RCAR/PYR/PYL (RCAR, Regulatory Component of ABA Receptor/PYR1, Pyrabactin Resistance 1/PYL, PYR1-like), putative ABA receptors that regulate SnRK kinases (Umezawa et al. 2009). ABI1 and ABI2, along with CIPK20, CIPK8, CIPK14 and CIPK15, manage proteinprotein interactions and regulate ABA signaling, gene expression and stress response (Guo et al. 2002, Ohta et al. 2003, Ludwik\u00f3w et al. 2013, Babula-Skowro\u0144ska et al. 2015. Other PP2C-interacting partners include transcription factors (Himmelbach et al. 2002), antioxidant enzymes (Miao et. al., 2006), constituents of the chromatin remodeling complex (Saez et al. 2008) and components of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway (Ludwik\u00f3w et al. 2014), which have likewise been identified as important to the ABA signaling network.",

            "text": "Despite studies indicating that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important for ABA signaling, little is known about the interplay between MAPKs and PP2Cs in this pathway. A MAPK cascade is a conserved module comprised of at least three elements: MKKKs, MKKs and MAPKs. A group of MKKKKs have also been identified (Jonak et al. 2002, Yoon et al. 2010. MKKKs link upstream receptors with downstream MKKs. MKKKs (as dual specificity kinases) phosphorylate MKKs on Ser/Thr residues in conserved S/T-X3-5-S/T motifs localized in an activation loop (T-loop). Once activated, the MKKs phosphorylate MAPKs at the TxY motif located in their T-loop. Upon activation, the MAPKs phosphorylate downstream substrates, thereby initiating various cellular responses. Among the MAPKs, MPK6 is known to interact with ABI1 PP2C. Both ABI1 and MPK6 are involved in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses (Leung et al. 2006). In addition, MPK3, MPK6, MPK9 and MPK12 have been identified as regulators of ABA signaling in guard cells (Lampard et al. 2009, Brock et al. 2010, Jammes et al. 2011, Salam et al. 2013. MKK1-MPK6 were found to be transiently activated by ABA treatment, to affect downstream generation of H 2 O 2 and to regulate guard cell aperture (Xing et al. 2008). Other kinases, such as MPK9 and MPK12, act upstream of anion channels in guard cell ABA signaling (Jammes et al. 2009). In addition, MKK7 and MKK9 are known to act as regulators during stomatal development (Lampard et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Because MKKKs constitute the largest and most complex group of MAP cascade kinases, only a few MPK modules have been recognized and documented. Reaactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in plants involves the MEKK1-MKK2-MPK4 phosphorylation pathway Hirt 2008, Pitzschke et al. 2009). In apple, the cascade MdMKK1-MdMPK1 is activated by ABA (Wang et al. 2010). In Arabidopsis, an unknown MKKK-MKK4/5-MPK3/6 module, and MEKK1-MKK1/2-MPK4, are two MAPK cascades that govern flg22-dependent gene expression (Suarez-Rodriguez et al. 2007, Qiu et al. 2008, Nicaise et al. 2009, Boudsocq et al. 2010, Kong et al. 2012. Another MAPK cascade consists of YODA activating MKK4/ 5-MKK7/MKK9 and MPK3/6: the YODA module is an important protein complex that regulates stomatal development and affects inflorescence architecture by promoting cell proliferation (Wang et al. 2007, Lampard et al. 2009, Meng et al. 2012. Very recently, a MAPK cascade, MAP3K17/ 18-MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14, was found to play a role in ABA stress signaling (Danquah et al. 2015) and senescence (Matsuoka et al. 2015).",

These elements included ABRE (PyAC GTGGC) and DRE elements (TACCGACAT) (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki et al. 2005), an ASF1 regulatory sequence (Krawczyk et al. 2002), POLLENLELAT52 (Bate and Twell, 1998), a W-box (Yamasaki et al. 2012) and a TAAAG element required for guard cell-specific gene expression (Plesch et al, 2001). At 24 h after the ABA treatment, a full-length ProMKKK18:GUS construct delivered strong GUS expression in the flowers, leaves and root tissues (Fig. 1). In developing flowers, MKKK18 promoter activity was observed in sepals, anther filaments, ovaries and meristem tissues (Fig. 1C-F).

            "text": "To determine MKKK18 protein localization in vivo, C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were generated and transiently expressed under the control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. MKKK18-GFP was predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas, as expected, an empty vector control did not show background fluorescence in any cellular compartment ( Fig. 2A). Next, we addressed whether kinase activity affected MKKK18 localization. By multisequence alignment of Arabidopsis MAPKKK, we identified conserved residues important for the activity of MKKK18. Based on this analysis, a kinase-inactive allele (K32M) and a permanently active form of MKKK18 (T161E) were generated. The K32M version of the protein is modified in its ATP-binding loop, while the permanently active, T161E form of MKKK18 is modified in the kinase domain. All versions of MKKK18 were fused to GFP and were again expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Interestingly, the K32M version retained barely detectable kinase activity and was localized outside the nucleus. However, the fluorescent signal of the permanently active T161E version of MKKK18-GFP clearly accumulated in the nucleus of Arabidopsis protoplasts, suggesting a role in mediating the signaling function of MKKK18 in this compartment ( Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of full-length fusion proteins in protoplasts (Fig. 2B).",

In response to treatment with ABA, RD29B and RAB18 expression was significantly down-regulated in both MKKK18 knockout lines compared with MKKK18oe and wildtype (WT) plants (P < 0.001), suggesting that ABA-mediated induction of these genes is regulated by MKKK18.

Seeds of MKKK18oe lines and mkkk18 knockouts were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with ABA, and the germination rate was analyzed and compared with that of WT seeds. As indicated in Fig. 3E, both knockout lines showed similar growth rates to WT Col-0 in the presence of low concentrations of ABA. In contrast, Col-0/35S:MKKK18-GFP germinated better than the WT Col-0 control, which was supported by the t-test results (P < 0.001) between the WT and independent MKKK18oe lines. This observation indicated that the 35S:MKKK18-GFP-overexpressing line displayed insensitivity towards ABA at the level of germination, suggesting that MKKK18 was required for germination. Next, in the search for ABA-related phenotypes, we analyzed ABAmediated inhibition of root expansion. In the presence of 2 mM ABA, root elongation in seedlings expressing 35S:MKKK18-GFP was reduced by 15% compared with the WT Col-0 control seedlings (n = 46; P < 0.0001). At the same ABA level, the mkkk18-1 and mkkk18-2 knockout lines showed improved root growth (40% and 20%, respectively) compared with the WT Col-0 line ( Fig. 3F).",

Therefore, we compared the number and density of stomata in 6-and 10-day-old seedlings of both MKKK18-oe lines and MKKK18 knockout lines (Fig. 4A). In the cotyledons, the stomatal index (SI) was significantly reduced, by 19% and 26%, in mkkk18-1 (P < 0.001) and mkkk18-2 (P < 0.0001), respectively. Consistent with this trend in SI, the abaxial SI for MKKK18oe lines was 7% higher than that for WT lines. Because GUS expression driven by the MKKK18 promoter was detected in guard cells, we analyzed whether MKKK18 was involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture. Compared with leaves from the WT, leaves from both knockout lines showed increased stomatal aperture under normal growth conditions. However, this effect was more pronounced in the mkkk18-2 mutant (Fig. 4B). Measurements of stomatal aperture in response to ABA revealed that stomata from the knockout lines were again significantly more open than in the WT. Accordingly, MKKK18oe lines were hypersensitive to ABA-induced stomatal closure (Fig. 4C). Next, we analyzed whether MKKK18 acted downstream of responses to CaCl 2 or H 2 O 2 in guard cell ABA signaling. Compared with WT Col-0, the knockout lines were significantly, if only slightly, impaired in H 2 O 2 -induced stomatal closure but not in response to CaCl 2 ( Fig. 4C) .",

To test the specificity of the generated antibodies, we performed immunoprecipitation of recombinant MKKK18-glutathione Stransferase (GST) with and without an epitope-mimicking peptide. We found that the generated antibody recognized recombinant MKKK18-GST ( Fig. 5A, B), while pre-incubation of anti-MKKK18-coupled beads with the peptide blocked immunoprecipitation of MKKK18 (Fig. 5A). We then tested the antibody in Arabidopsis extracts, but were unable to detect the MKKK18 protein directly, either by immunoblot analysis of the total protein extract or in the immunoprecipitates from WT Col-0 and knockout lines. Nevertheless, MKKK18 immunocomplex activity was detectable in ABA-treated WT Col-0, although not in ABA-treated knockout lines ( Fig. 5C), demonstrating that both knockout lines are deficient in MKKK18 activity.

Positive results, indicating interaction, were seen only for the ABI1-MKKK18 pair ( Fig.  6A, B; Supplementary Fig. S2). The binding of ABI1 to MKKK18 was then analyzed using pull-down assays. Streptag-ABI1, and Streptag-ABI2 as a control, were purified from plant extracts and incubated with recombinant MKKK18-GST and His-MKKK18, respectively. Again, only ABI1 was capable of binding MKKK18, indicating substrate specificity of ABI1 PP2Cs for interaction with MKKK18 ( Fig. 6C, D). This result was further confirmed by BiFC experiments using ABI1 (or ABI2 as a control) with MKKK18, which also revealed that ABI1 and MKKK18 were capable of interacting ( Fig. 6E, F; Supplementary Fig. S3).",

Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transfected with 35S:MKKK18-GFP constructs, and immunocomplex MKKK18 activity was determined by in vitro kinase assays in the presence of recombinant ABI1 or ABI2 proteins (Fig. 7A, B). ABI1 but not ABI2 inhibited MKKK18 kinase activity. As a control treatment, the activities of both PP2Cs were assessed using a non-radioactive phosphatase assay (Fig. 7A). Previous studies revealed that ABI1 can inhibit the autoactivation of SnRK2 kinases (Ng et al. 2011). To test the mechanism of MKKK18 activation and the role of ABI1 in this process, we purified recombinant GST-MKKK18 and analyzed the kinase activity in vitro in the presence of the downstream in vivo substrate, MKK3 (Danquah et al. 2015, Matsuoka et al. 2015, and an artificial substrate, MBP. As a positive control for the kinase activity assay, SnRK2.6 was used (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, we observed no autophosphorylation activity of MKKK18 and as a consequence no phosphorylation of the substrates.

Recently, we demonstrated that ABI1 controls turnover of ACC synthase 6 (Ludwik\u00f3w et al. 2014, Ludwik\u00f3w, 2015; therefore, we hypothesize that ABI1 might also be involved in the regulation of MKKK18 stability. To test this hypothesis, we first examined MKKK18 transcript levels in WT plants and two independent ABI1 knockout lines, abi1td (Ludwikow et al. 2009) and abi1-2 (Saez et al. 2006). Importantly, in response to 90 min of 50 mM ABA treatment, MKKK18 expression was significantly lower in both ABI1 Fig. 6 MKKK18 interacts with the ABI1 protein phosphatase. (A) Yeast two-hybrid analysis of the interaction between MKKK18 and ABI1/2 PP2Cs. Diploid yeast colonies were grown on double (DDO-SD medium without Leu and Trp) or quadruple selective medium (QDO-SD medium without Leu, Trp, His or Ade) with or without supplemented X-a-Gal and aureobasidin. The bait (MKKK18) did not autoactivate the reporter genes in yeast. (B) Detection of ABI1/2 and MKKK18 expression in diploid yeast strains. Expression of BD and AD fusion proteins in yeast was determined by immunoblotting using specific anti-ABI1, anti-ABI2 and anti-MKKK18 antibodies.

Recombinant GST-MKKK18 or His-MKKK18 was pre-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose, and incubated with StrepTag-ABI1 or StrepTag-ABI2, respectively.

Because the decrease in MKKK18 transcript accumulation does not explain the increased MKKK18 kinase activity in the ABI1 knockout, we examined the turnover of MKKK18. Cellfree degradation assays showed that recombinant GST-MKKK18 was degraded more slowly in abi1td than in WT cell extracts (Fig. 9B). The degradation was blocked by MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor) in both abi1td and WT plant extracts. The half-life of GST-MKKK18 in the assay was substantially longer in abi1td protein extracts compared with WT protein extracts (Fig. 9C, D). Overall, these results demonstrate that ABI1 PP2C regulates MKKK18 turnover.",

In this study, we show that loss of MKKK18 function leads to impaired stomatal development and a constitutive phenotype with more open stomata. As previously documented, ABA inhibits initiation of stomatal development (Tanaka et al. 2013), reducing the number of stomata per leaf and decreasing the SI (Franks andFarquhar 2001, Tanaka et al. 2013). Our results show that the SI of the MKKK18oe lines is significantly higher than in the WT Col-0 line (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the SIs of both MKKK18 knockouts are significantly lower ( Fig. 4), suggesting that MKKK18 acts as a positive regulator of stomatal development. Interestingly, another MKKK, YODA, which fine-tunes this process, acts as a negative regulator in the early stages, but acts as a positive regulator in the final step, of stomatal development (Wang et al. 2007, Lampard et al. 2009). According to Danquah et al. (2015) and Matsuoka et al. (2015), the MKKK17/18 kinase cascade recruits MKK3-MPK1/2/7/14. YODA activates the MKK4/5-MKK7/MKK9 and MPK3/6 pathways during stomatal development. Thus we may hypothesize that the MKKK18 pathway is largely independent of YODA, although it may co-operate in the final stages of stomatal development. The involvement of different MAPK cascades in the same process was reviewed recently (Danquah et al. 2014), while participation of the same cascades in different processes has also been reported (Wang et al. 2007, Meng et al. 2012.",

For example, germinating MKKK18oe seedlings exhibit a weak ABAinsensitive phenotype (Fig. 3E), while overexpression of MKKK18 also causes ABA-hypersensitive stomatal closing and root growth (Figs. 3C, 4F). This suggests that similar MKKK18-based signaling pathways may operate in these processes, but the opposite Fig. 8 MKKK18 activity increases in the abi1td mutant in response to ABA treatment. (A) Seedlings of WT Col-0 and the abi1td and snrk2.6 mutants were treated with 100 mM ABA for the indicated times. A 600 mg aliquot of total protein was used for the immune complex MKKK18 activity assay using anti-MKKK18 antibody. Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining of MBP confirmed equal loading. Due to low abundance, the endogenous MKKK18 protein was not detectable by immunoblot analysis. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments (n = 9) with consistent results. (B) 32 P-labeled MBP bands were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized by taking the radioactivity of the band in the absence of ABA as 1. Data are means \u00b1 SD of the relative band intensities from three independent experiments (n = 9). phenotypic responses to ABA stimulus may also be observed, indicating that MKKK18 signaling integrates various pathways.",

            "text": "Protein kinase autoactivation, via phosphorylation of the activation loop, is a common regulatory mechanism that switches the status of the signaling cascades to standby. Very recently, it was shown that recombinant GST-MKKK18 is able to autophosphorylate in vitro (Matsuoka et al. 2015). Our data appear to contradict this result. Compared with a positive control, SnRK2.6 kinase (Ng et al. 2011), we conclude that MKKK18 does not undergo autoactivation (Fig. 7). In our hands, GST-MKKK18 autophosphorylates neither during production in bacterial cells nor in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 7C). Our results suggest, therefore, that MKKK18 must be activated by an upstream kinase (possibly a receptor kinase or another type of protein kinase) Fig. 9 Proteasome-dependent degradation of MKKK18 is ABA-dependent and regulated by ABI1. (A) qPCR analysis of MKKK18 transcript accumulation in response to treatment with 50 mM ABA for 90 min in WT Col-0, MKKK18oe, abi1td and abi1-2 strains. MKKK18 expression levels were determined using three biological replicates and were normalized against 18S rDNA. The results are displayed as mean log 2 fold change \u00b1 SE (n = 9) of three independent experiments with consistent results. (B) MKKK18 stability in the cell-free degradation assay. GST-MKKK18 was incubated with 100 mg of protein extract from either WT Col-0 or abi1td protoplasts incubated with or without 100 mM MG132 for 6 h in the dark. GST-MKKK18 protein levels at the indicated time points were determined by immunoblotting using anti-GST antibodies. Ponceau S staining confirmed equal loading. (C and D) Half-life plot for cell-free degradation of MKKK18 in WT Col-0 (C) and abi1td (D) extracts. Immunoblot images from each experiment were recorded simultaneously using a G:BOX Chemi XR5 fluorescence and chemiluminescence imaging system (Syngene), and the results were quantified using ImageJ software. (E) CHX treatment suppresses accumulation of MKKK18. Arabidopsis protoplasts expressing 35S:MKKK18-GFP were treated with 3 mM CHX, 3 mM CHX and 100 mM MG132, or given a mock treatment. The blot is representative of four experiments. MKKK18-GFP protein levels were determined by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies. Ponceau S staining confirmed equal loading. MKKK18 protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software and normalized to the control (mock) band (set as 1). (F) MKKK18 protein levels are modified by ABA. GST-MKKK18 was incubated with 100 mg of total protein extract isolated from WT Col-0 incubated with or without 50 mM ABA for 3 h in the dark.

ABI1/2 are known to be negative regulators of ABA signaling that interact with the ABA receptors RCAR/PYR/PYL and SnRK2s (Ma et al. 2009, Vlad et al. 2009. Importantly, ABA-induced MKKK18 kinase activity is significantly increased in the ABI1 knockout (Fig. 8), while MKKK18 transcript levels were significantly reduced (Fig. 9A) compared with the WT. Our results suggest that the ABI1 protein phosphatase is needed for down-regulation of the pathway mediated by MKKK18.

            "text": "In addition, functional activation of the MKKK18 pathway is also constrained at the transcriptional level. MKKK18 expression is nearly abolished in ABA-insensitive abi1-1 (Hoth et al. 2002), hab1 G246D and quadruple pyr1pyl1pyl2pyr4 ABA receptor mutants (Danaquah et al. 2015). Importantly, the hab1 G246D mutant confers an equivalent hypermorphic mutation to abi1-1 (abi1G180D). Consistent with this, we observed that MKKK18 activity is abolished in the snrk2.6 mutant and another ABA-insensitive mutant (Fig. 8). Because SnRK2.6 activity is abolished or nearly abolished in snrk2.6, abi1-1 and pyr1pyl1-pyl2pyr4 mutants, it is most likely that MKKK18 transcription is controlled by SnRK2.6. In the abi1td mutant, decreased MKKK18 transcription compensates for its increased stability. Overall, we may conclude that components of the core ABA pathway regulate MKKK18 function at multiple levels.",

            "text": "Another element of kinase activity regulation, especially in signal transduction pathways, is protein degradation via the proteasome pathway (Coulombe et al. 2003, Wang and Dohlman 2006, Peng et al. 2008, Fragoso et al. 2009, Lyzenga et al. 2013. Ubiquitinated proteins are present at low abundance and are unstable: in mammalian cells, MEKK1 and several isoforms of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are degraded via the proteasome pathway, leading to inactivation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways mediated by MEKK1 (Wang and Dohlman 2006). In Arabidopsis, well-documented examples of protein kinase degradation include SnRK1.1, SnRK1.2, GSK3-like kinase and CIPK26 (Peng et al. 2008, Fragoso et al. 2009, Lyzenga et al. 2013). Here we demonstrate that the interaction between ABI1 and MKKK18 is necessary for the destruction of the MKKK18 kinase ( Fig. 9B-D). As shown recently, ABI1 promotes the degradation of ACS6 protein (Ludwik\u00f3w et al. 2014). This new role of ABI1 phosphatase is not restricted to a single protein, but also extends to the regulation of MKKK18 activity. We show that ABI1 inhibits MKKK18 activity (Fig. 7B) and, using a cell-free assay, we reveal that ABI1 promotes its degradation (Fig. 9B-D). Consistent with this, we also show that ABA treatment increases MKKK18 stability in cell-free assays (Fig. 9F), presumably due to inhibition of the ABI1 PP2C by ABA. However, it is possible that other mechanisms also regulate MKKK18 turnover. For example, the accumulation of the ABA-responsive transcription factor abscisic acid insensitive5 (ABI5) is achieved by ABA-dependent regulation of KEG E3 ligase turnover (Liu and Stone 2010). In conclusion, our results suggest that ABI1 PP2C can be considered a key player in the ABA-dependent feedback mechanism for resetting various signaling pathways to pre-stimulatory status.",

Our current findings demonstrate that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events play an important role in the transmission of the ABA signal. Although the SnRK2 protein kinases and group A PP2C-type phosphatases constitute a core ABA signaling pathway, the involvement of other groups of proteins, including MAP cascade kinases, has been recognized and documented in earlier studies (for the most recent review, see Danquah et al. 2014). The critical outstanding questions facing researchers are: which MAPKs are involved in ABA signal transduction, and what are the molecular details of the response to this signal? The analyses presented here demonstrate that MKKK18 is an ABAactivated kinase regulated by ABI1 and the proteasome. Based on the results presented in this study and on previously published data (Irigoyen et al. 2014), we propose a schematic model (Fig. 10) to describe the effect of ABI1 regulation on MKKK18. Further analysis will help to elucidate novel regulatory mechanisms involving MKKK18.",

Under standard conditions, active ABI1 protein phosphatase inhibits MKKK18 kinase activity and protein stability. ABA receptors and dephosphorylated MKKK18 are directed for degradation via the proteasome pathway. In the presence of ABA, ABI1 PP2C activity is restrained by binding of ABI1 to the ABA-PYL complex (ABA signaling is turned on). Active MKKK18 activates the downstream cascade. ABA inhibits the degradation of ABA receptors by limiting their polyubiquitination. camera. The SI was calculated individually for each cotyledon using the formula: SI = [number of stomata/(number of other epidermal cells + number of stomata)]. For statistical analysis, Student's t-test was performed. For guard cell aperture measurements, rosette leaves of 5-week-old plants were floated in opening buffer (10 mM KCl, 7.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM MES-KOH, at pH 6.15) and incubated at 20 C under light conditions for 2 h to open the stomata. Subsequently, the same opening buffer was supplemented with either 15 mM ABA, 1 mM H 2 O 2 or 1 mM CaCl 2 , and the leaves were incubated for another 2 h. The stomatal apertures (width divided by length) along three different epidermal transects were measured using a Nikon Eclipse Ti (with Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi1c digital camera) and Nikon NIS Elements AR software. No less than 60 mature stomata were analyzed per transect.",
