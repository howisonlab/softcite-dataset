            "text": "Background: The primary aim of this study was to compare the differences in temperamentcharacter traits, suicide attempts, impulsivity, and functionality levels of patients with bipolar disorder I (BD-I) and bipolar disorder II (BD-II). Methods: Fifty-two BD-I patients and 49 BD-II patients admitted to Erenk\u00f6y Mental and Neurological Disease Training and Research Hospital psychiatry clinic and fifty age-and sexmatched healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. A structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Axis I Disorders, Temperament and Character Inventory, Barrett Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11), Hamilton Depression Inventory Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Bipolar Disorder Functioning Questionnaire (BDFQ) were administered to patients and to control group. Results: No statistically significant difference in sociodemographic features existed between the patient and control groups (P.0.05). Thirty-eight subjects (37.62%) in the patient group had a suicide attempt. Twenty-three of these subjects (60.52%) had BD-I, and 15 of these subjects (39.47%) had BD-II. Suicide attempt rates in BD-I and II patients were 60.52% and 39.47%, respectively (P,0.05). Comparison of BD-I and II patients with healthy control subjects revealed that cooperativeness (C), self-directedness (Sdi), and self-transcendence (ST) scores were lower and novelty seeking (NS1 and NS2), harm avoidance (HA4), and reward dependence (RD2) subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-I. When BD-I patients were compared with BD-II patients, BIS-11 (attention) scores were higher in patients with BD-II and BIS-11 (motor and nonplanning impulsivity) scores were higher in patients with BD-I. According to BDFQ, relations with friends, participation in social activities, daily activities and hobbies, and occupation subscale scores were lower and taking initiative subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-I. Social withdrawal subscale scores were higher in patients with BD-II. Conclusion: In our study, NS, HA, and RD scores that may be found high in suicide attempters and Sdi scores that may be found low in suicide attempters were as follows: NS1, NS2, HA4, and RD2 subscale scores were high and Sdi scores were low in patients with BD-I, suggesting a higher rate of suicide attempts in this group of patients. In addition, C and Sdi scores that indicate a predisposition to personality disorder were significantly lower in patients with BD-I than patients with BD-II and healthy controls, suggesting a higher rate of personality disorder comorbidity in patients with BD-I. Higher impulsivity and suicidality rates and poorer functionality in patients with BD-I also suggest that patients with BD-I may be more impulsive and more prone to suicide and have poorer functionality in some areas.",

            "text": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder characterized by manic, depressive, and mixed episodes, and life-expectancy has been found to be much shorter in patients, with BD prevalence of BD-I and BD-II being 0.8% and 0.5% respectively. 1,2 BD is divided into BD-I, BD-II, cyclothymic disorder, and BD not otherwise specified (NOS) subgroups according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) classification system. 3 In a study examining Bipolar spectrum disorders among 300 patients, BD rate was found to be high and a majority of the BD cases had BD-II. 4 The presence of other Axis I disorders, alcohol and substance use, rapid cycling, early onset of bipolar, a family history of suicide attempts, and severe mixed and depressive episodes may constitute risk factors for suicide attempts in patients with BD. 5 Patients with BD have a suicide rate that is 30 times higher than the general population, and 15%-25% of bipolar patients attempt suicide. Fifteen percent of those who attempted suicide succeed in ending their lives. 6 Although no difference exists in attempted suicide rates between BD-I and BD-II patients, BD-II patients tend toward more lethal suicide attempts. 7 Personality disorder comorbidity in patients with psychiatric disorders has been reported to increase the risk of suicide. 8,9 Personality traits are among the many predictors of suicide in patients with BD. 10 Cloninger has developed a dimensional psychobiological model of personality that accounts for two major components of personality: temperament and character traits. Cloninger's psychobiological theory of personality contains four temperament dimensions including novelty seeking (NS), harm avoidance (HA), reward dependence (RD), and persistence (P) along with three character dimensions including self-directedness (Sdi), cooperativeness (C), and self-transcendence (ST). Temperament dimensions reflect biological, hereditary aspects of personality. Temperament is distinguished from character by individual differences in interpersonal relationships and object relations. Meanwhile, life events, culture, and social learning mold character dimensions. [11][12][13][14] BD patients have higher novelty-seeking scores and lower persistence scores than depressive patients and normal subjects. 15,16 Higher NS scores may predict impaired functioning. 17 In addition, current research findings show that specific temperament types (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable, and anxious) are the subsyndromal (trait-related) manifestations and commonly the antecedents of minor and major mood disorders. Up to 20% of the population has some kind of marked temperaments; depressive, cyclothymic, and anxious temperament is more frequent in women, whereas hyperthymic and irritable temperaments predominate among men. Premorbid temperament types have an important role in the clinical evolution of minor and major mood episodes including the direction of the polarity and the symptom formation of acute mood episodes. They can also significantly affect the long-term course and outcome including suicidality and other forms of self-destructive behaviors. 18 More than 81% of the patients with prevailing cyclothymic-depressiveanxious temperament had mild-to-severe suicidal risk on the MINI versus only around 42% of the patients with prevailing hyperthymic temperament. 19 Here, we aimed to compare a history of attempted suicide, temperament character traits, impulsivity, and levels of functionality in BD-I and BD-II patients admitted to our outpatient clinic.",

            "text": "In the literature, suicide risk factors for patients with BD-I and BD-II include a family history of suicide attempts, early onset of BD, frequent depressive symptoms, alcohol and substance abuse, social phobia features, antidepressant-induced mania, and a history of head trauma. No statistically significant differences were found in terms of suicide ideation and attempts between patients with BD-I and BD-II. 41,42 Suicideattempt rates were higher in patients with BD compared to patients with unipolar depressive disorder. Suicide-attempt rates were also higher in patients with BD-II as compared to BD-I. 42 However in our study, 23 (60.52%) of 38 attempters  had BD-I, and 15 (39.47%) had BD-II. Other studies of BD patients have identified that unipolar patients had higher NS 10 and lower Sdi 6 scores compared to healthy controls. In a similar study, patients with BD had higher NS scores than patients with unipolar disorder and patients with bipolar and unipolar disorder had higher HA scores than healthy controls. 15 In our study, within temperament dimension, NS1, NS2, HA4, and RD2 subscale scores were significantly higher in patients with BD-I than BD-II and healthy controls. Within character dimension, total Sdi scores, total C scores, and subscale scores for both dimensions were significantly lower in patients with BD-I than BD-II and healthy controls. In addition, total ST scores and ST subscale scores were significantly higher in patients with BD-II than BD-I and healthy controls. Because Slama et al 40 considered C and Sdi scores as predictors of personality disorder, low C and Sdi scores in patients with BD-I suggest that the coexistence of personality disorder with BD could be more frequent in patients with BD-I. NS indicates a hereditary predisposition to exploratory activity in response to a new stimulus, impulsive decision making and irritability. [12][13][14]38 Because in our study NS scores were higher in patients with BD-I, we may think that these patients may be more prone to impulsive behaviors like suicide.",

One of these differences was that suicide attempters had more subjective depression and hopelessness, as well as more seriously suicidal ideations; they also displayed lifelong reactionary and aggressive tendencies. Patients who had attempted suicide were more impulsive in decision making and interpersonal relationships. 43,44 Lifelong aggression levels were higher in patients with suicide attempts, but impulsivity levels were similar between the two groups. 45 In our study, both motor and nonplanned impulsivity scores were higher in patients with BD-I than BD-II. In the manic phase, impulsivity is characterized by unplanned and motor impulsivity, whereas in the depressive phase, it is characterized again by unplanned impulsivity. Attentional impulsivity is present in BD-II. Impulsive behaviors such as suicide attempts usually occur in the depressive phase of BD. 46,47 In our study, in concordance with literature, motor and nonplanned impulsivity was pronounced in patients with BD-I and attentional impulsivity was pronounced in patients with BD-II.",

Early diagnosis, individual assessment of symptomatology, and the establishment of a treatment process are the most important factors. Our study has shown that impulsivity and risk of attempting suicide are higher in patients with BD-I than BD-II. In addition, patients with BD-I are found to have poorer functionality than patients with BD-II. High NS1, NS2, HA4, RD2 subscale scores and low Sdi and C scores may be related to suicide attempts. Higher motor and nonplanned impulsivity scores in patients with BD-I than BD-II suggest that these may be facilitating factors for an impulsive behavior like suicide. Identifying impulsivity, suicide attempts, temperament-character traits, and functionality in patients with BD-I and BD-II will be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease progression.",
