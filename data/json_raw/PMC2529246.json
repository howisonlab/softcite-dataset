Thanks to the development of high accuracy mass spectrometers, peptide sequencing without prior knowledge of the amino acid sequence-de novo sequencing-can be performed. In this work, absolute quantification of a set of key enzymes involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in Medicago truncatula 'Jemalong A17' root nodules is presented. Among them, sucrose synthase (SuSy; EC 2.4.1.13), one of the central enzymes in sucrose cleavage in root nodules, has been further characterized and the relative phosphorylation state of the three most abundant isoforms has been quantified. De novo sequencing provided sequence information of a so far unidentified peptide, most probably belonging to SuSy2, the second most abundant isoform in M. truncatula root nodules. TiO 2phosphopeptide enrichment led to the identification of not only a phosphorylation site at Ser11 in SuSy1, but also of several novel phosphorylation sites present in other root nodule proteins such as alkaline invertase (AI; EC 3.2.1.26) and an RNA-binding protein.",

            "text": "Legumes are able to establish nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relations with soil bacteria generally termed rhizobia. This symbiosis is beneficial for both partners: plants provide a carbon source and nutrients for the microsymbiont which, in return, produces a reduced form of nitrogen directly assimilatable by the plant. Sucrose is the main carbohydrate transported via phloem to sink tissues like nodules, where it is metabolized by either SuSy or AI (Morell and Copeland, 1984;Flemetakis et al., 2006). SuSy is a cytosolic enzyme, which catalyses the cleavage of sucrose to fructose and UDP-glucose (Okamoto and Akazawa, 1980). This enzyme is considered primarily responsible for sucrose metabolism in mature nitrogenfixing nodules, as it has been shown to be essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in a variety of legume plants (Gordon et al., 1999;Horst et al., 2007;Kuster et al., 2007). In addition, it has been demonstrated that SuSy is involved in the regulation of nitrogen fixation under different abiotic stresses, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level (Gonzalez et al., 1995;Gordon et al., 1997;Zhang et al., 1999).",

Based on transcriptional profiles, five isoforms have been described that are expressed in root nodules. However, a recent multi-dimensional LC-MS/ MS-based proteomic profiling study which identified around 400 proteins from M. truncatula root nodules was only able to identify SuSy1, the most abundant isoform (Larrainzar et al., 2007). In contrast to shotgun proteomic techniques, targeted MS approaches allow for the detection and quantification of low abundance proteins present in complex samples Mallick et al., 2007). While western blots are very sensitive and have been widely used for semi-quantitative protein analysis, absolute quantification can only be achieved when used in conjunction isoform specific antibodies and is subsequently scarcely used (Duncan et al., 2006). Thus, the fact that protein quantification by western blots is only relative, the requirement of specific antibodies, together with the limitation in the number of proteins detectable per analysis, has led to the development of alternative LC/MS-based techniques such as the so-called 'mass western' (Lehmann et al., 2008).",

This is probably due to the relatively low abundance of the other isoforms, together with the similarity they share at the amino acid sequence level, which limits an MS/MS-based discrimination. Figure 2 represents an alignment of the N-terminal region of the five described SuSy isoform sequences. Sequences for SuSy1 and SuSy3 (TC94447) appear to be complete, whereas the known sequences for SuSy2 (TC95820), SuSy5 (TC99016), and SuSy4 (TC98648) are estimated to be 72, 40, and 19%, respectively.

            "text": "When comparing sequences of protein isoforms, it is common to find certain amino acid differences encoded by SNPs [i.e. glutamine (Q) for glutamic acid (E) or asparagine (N) for aspartic acid (D)]. These sequence variations are translated into mass differences in peptides enabling isoform discrimination using MS. Looking for this type of polymorphism, the predicted amino acid sequences of the SuSy isoforms were aligned (Fig. 2) and examined for potential candidates with this type of polymorphism. A SuSy1 tryptic peptide containing some of the above-mentioned residues was subsequently chosen (SIGNGVQFLNR). After screening the gel sample for masses corresponding to the doubly charged peptide, two ions were selected: one corresponding to a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 602.8 derived from a SuSy1 tryptic peptide, and the other peptide of unknown sequence with an m/z of 603.3. De novo sequencing was performed on the unknown ion and was identified as the peptide (SI)GDGVQFLNR (Fig. 3), which did not match any of the previously reported sequences (Fig. 2). The observed mass difference corresponds to a shift starting from ion y7, explained by a replacement of D instead of the original N residue present in SuSy1. The only other possible combination producing a 603.3 m/z peptide would be the replacement of isoleucine (I) for leucine (L) in the N-terminal region. However, as this region appears to be well-conserved in the amino acid sequence of SuSy in different legume plants (data not shown), this alternative appears to be less likely. Furthermore, peptides derived from both SuSy1 and SuSy2 were detected during the analysis of 1D-PAGE samples (see Materials and methods and Fig. 2), further supporting the hypothesis that the new peptide is driven from SuSy2 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, SuSy2 is the second most abundant isoform in M. truncatula root nodules at the transcript level (Hohnjec et al., 2003).",

As only 19% of the SuSy4 sequence is Absolute quantification of nodule proteins based on mass western and phosphoproteomics 3311 available (Fig. 2), this isoform was excluded from the analysis. Out of the four isoforms analysed, absolute quantification was only possible for three of them (Table 3; Fig. 4). SuSy5 appeared either to be below the detection limit or not present in nodules under the conditions investigated. Results show that SuSy2 is the second most abundant isoform present in M. truncatula root nodules. This finding further supports the hypothesis that the de novo peptide sequence belongs to this second isoform. Due to the high sensitivity of this technique, SuSy3 was also successfully identified, despite its much weaker signal (Fig. 4). Absolute quantification of the different isoforms shows that the protein ratios for SuSy1:SuSy2:SuSy3 are 1:0.013:0.0018 (Table 3). These results are in agreement with a recent transcript analysis in pea nodules (Marino et al., 2008), where the ratio for the three isoforms was 1:0.002:1.7 3 10 \u00c05 . From a technical point of view, the four orders of magnitude range determined in a single analysis corresponds to the current maximum capacity for a MS-based analysis . This limitation is mainly due to the limit of detection of each peptide and the loading capacity of the columns. Nevertheless, the sensitivity (2 ng) in the present study has been shown to be comparable to those of western blots (Lehmann et al., 2008). A significant advantage of the mass western is that it allows for absolute quantification and for multiple targets to be analysed in a single run. Furthermore, mass western provides a direct measurement of protein concentration, not available by transcript analysis.    Fig. 4. Mass western of four SuSy isoforms detected in M. truncatula root nodule protein extract using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and specific stable isotope-labelled standard peptides (see Table 1).",

            "text": "Absolute quantification enables the analysis of complete metabolic pathways in complex protein samples in a single analysis. In contrast to the previous analysis, where the starting materials employed were in-gel digests, absolute quantification was also carried out using nodule extract protein samples as the starting material. Internal standard peptides for glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), asparagine synthetase (AS), and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) were synthesized (peptide sequences shown in Table 1), and these metabolic enzymes, together with SuSy, were subjected to absolute quantification (Table 4). Regarding SuSy, only the most abundant isoform, SuSy1, representing about 1% of the total nodule proteins, was detected. The reason for this might be a higher signal-to-noise ratio of a complex protein sample compared to the pre-fractionated gel sample used in the previous analysis. However, the absolute amount of SuSy1 appears to be slightly higher in the complex nodule protein analysis indicating that the ingel analysis may be even more sensitive. Most of these enzymes involved in nodule N metabolism (GS, GDH, AAT) are well characterized and their activities are routinely assessed (Vance, 2008). Although most of the N exported from temperate climate nodules is in the form of asparagine, detection of AS activity in plant tissues is extremely difficult (Lea et al., 2007). The reasons for this are not clear, but they may be related to the presence of inhibitors (Joy et al., 1983), asparaginase activity (Streeter, 1977) or protein instability (Huber and Streeter, 1985). To overcome these limitations, quantification of AS gene expression has been suggested to be a good semi-quantitative indicator of its activity levels, showing a good correlation with asparagine:aspartate ratios transported to the shoot via the xylem (Antunes et al., 2008). The strategy shown in the present paper may provide a more accurate alternative for the quantification of AS in nodules.",

The meaning of this hyperphosphorylation state remains the subject of much debate. In soybean, in vitro studies suggest that nodule SuSy sucrose-cleavage activity is not dependent on the phosphorylation state of the protein, but rather influences the attachment of this enzyme to the membrane (Zhang et al., 1999). However, studies in maize have shown that leaf SuSy is activated when phosphorylated at its primary site (Ser15), while phosphorylation at Ser170 would trigger degradation of the enzyme (Hardin et al., 2003(Hardin et al., , 2004. More recently, it has been suggested that sucrose concentration and phosphorylation may regulate SuSy oligomerization and F-actin association in maize kernels and seedlings (Duncan and Huber, 2007). Regarding membrane attachment, Komina et al. (2002) investigated the phosphorylation state of membrane and soluble SuSy forms of nodules in soybean. Using several non-MS-based approaches, the microsomal SuSy fraction was found to be hypophosphorylated Absolute quantification of nodule proteins based on mass western and phosphoproteomics 3313 relative to the soluble form (on an equivalent SuSy protein base). Although abiotic stresses seem to have a negative impact on SuSy abundance, as well as on its phosphorylation levels (data not shown), the physiological meaning of a state of hyper-or hypophosphorylation remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "SuSy is one of the most characterized nodule proteins in legumes. Due to its relatively high abundance in root nodules and, specifically with regard to M. truncatula, its hyperphosphorylation state, it is understandable that the conserved Ser11 phosphopeptide has been described several times. In order to identify novel putative phosphorylated proteins in M. truncatula root nodules, a phosphopeptide enrichment strategy based on TiO 2 -affinity chromatography was carried out. As a result, several other phosphopetides were identified (Table 2). Among them, two phosphopeptides (AGLDNYDNYS 65 PGGR and SGFNTPAS 77 SAR) belonging to AI (TC106886), the other enzyme with a sucrose-cleavage activity in nodules. In contrast to SuSy, relative peak area quantification of both peptides indicated that AI is mostly hypophosporylated in nodules. The non-phosphorylated to the phosphorylated forms of Ser65 and Ser77 were determined to be in a ratio of 1:0.01:0.03, respectively. It has been suggested that AI is post-transcriptionally regulated through an interaction with a phospho-binding 14-3-3 protein in developing barley grains (Alexander and Morris, 2006). However, to our knowledge this is the first report where the actual phosphorylation sites of the protein are described. Several other phosphopeptides were found that belong to a putative RNA-binding protein (TC101080) and a hypothetical protein (TC97295), which is similar to a universal stress response protein described in Arabidopsis thaliana (At4g27320) ( Table 2). Although, thus far, little is known about the function of these proteins in nodules, they may be considered interesting candidates for further studies given the roles of phosphorylation in metabolic regulation. Nevertheless, several other nodule proteins have been suggested to be phosphorylated and were not identified in this present study. This is the case for both GS (Lima et al., 2006) and phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase (Zhang et al., 1995) from M. truncatula. Previously reported phosphopeptides from GS did not appear to be detectable after tryptic digestion, but may be detected using different proteolytic enzymes. In the case of phosphoenolpyruvate decarboxylase, phosphopeptides were not detected using the current approach as its molecular weight was out of range of the analysed bands subjected to TiO 2 enrichment. Therefore, future analysis may include a wider range of molecular weights to identify new nodule protein subject to protein phosphorylation.",

            "text": "This study has demonstrated for the first time the absolute quantification of three distinct M. truncatula SuSy isoforms in an independent tissue-specific manner. It is shown that, besides the nodule-enhanced SuSy1, two other protein isoforms are present in root nodules at quantifiable amounts. De novo sequencing allowed for the identification of a new peptide sequence, most probably driven from the second most abundant isoform SuSy2, which complements the existing sequence information based on transcript data. Absolute quantification of N metabolism enzymes was carried out, enabling the discrimination of different protein isoforms from a single analysis, even when those isoforms were present at very low amounts. Nodule SuSy1 was shown to be hyperphosphorylated at Ser11 in M. truncatula and novel phosphoproteins present in nodules were identified. All peptides found in this study can be viewed in the ProMEX spectral library (Hummel et al., 2007).",
