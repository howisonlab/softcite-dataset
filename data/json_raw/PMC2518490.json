MSCs were added to our previously described composite EC islets as a potential means to improve their capacity for islet angiogenesis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Human islets were coated with primary human bone marrow-derived MSCs and dermal microvascular ECs. The capacity of ECs, with or without MSCs, to adhere to and grow into human islets was analyzed. The survival and functionality of these composite islets were evaluated in a dynamic perifusion assay, and their capacity for angiogenesis in vitro was assessed in a three-dimensional fibrin gel assay. RESULTS-ECs proliferated after culture in MSC-conditioned medium, and MSCs improved the EC coverage threefold compared with EC islets alone. Islet survival in vitro and the functionality of the composite islets after culture were equal to those of control islets. The EC-MSC islets showed a twofold increase in total sprout formation compared with EC islets, and vascular sprouts emanating from the EC-MSC-islet surface showed migration of ECs into the islets and also into the surrounding matrix, either alone or in concert with MSCs. CONCLUSIONS-EC proliferation, sprout formation, and ingrowth of ECs into the islets were enhanced by MSCs. The use of composite EC-MSC islets may have beneficial effects on revascularization and immune regulation. The technique presented allows for pretreatment of donor islets with recipient-derived ECs and MSCs as a means of improving islet engraftment.",

The cell suspensions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2-3 h in suspension culture tubes in EC medium and mixed gently twice per hour during the incubation. Thereafter, the EC islets, EC-MSC islets, and untreated control islets were cultured for up to 6 days at 37\u00b0C in EC medium or islet medium (CMRL; Invitrogen) until analyzed. The medium was changed every second day. Quantification of EC adherence was performed on EC islets and EC-MSC islets after 1 and 4 days of culture. In vitro islet survival assay and cytokine and insulin content determination. A total of 100 islets per donor (n \u03ed 6) were hand picked: 50 islets were coated with 5 \u03eb 10 3 MSCs and 5 \u03eb 10 3 ECs, and 50 islets were untreated. All islets were cultured for 6 days in EC medium, with a medium change every second day. The number of remaining islets in the respective groups were counted after 1, 3, and 6 days of culture, and the islet number was confirmed after 6 days by dithizone staining (18). Control and EC-MSC islets were collected after 6 days of culture. Total DNA (Picogreen; Invitrogen), interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6 (R&D Systems, Oxford, U.K.), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.), tissue factor (TF) (Imubind; American Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), and insulin (Mercodia) contents were measured on a Gyrolab workstation (Gyros, Uppsala, Sweden), and the values were divided with total DNA. Four or more different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Dynamic perifusion. The functionality of the islets coated with EC-MSC and of untreated islets from the same isolation was tested at different time points after coating (at 24 h and day 3-4). EC medium was used during the first 24 h of suspension culture; thereafter, the medium was changed to islet medium with supplements (17). Islets were challenged in a dynamic perifusion system, beginning with a low glucose concentration (1.67 mmol/l) during the first 36 min, followed by a high-glucose challenge (20 mmol/l) for 42 min, then reexposure to the low glucose concentration during the last 48 min. Fractions were collected at 6-min intervals over 126 min and analyzed for insulin content using commercial ELISA kits (Mercodia Insulin ELISA; Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). The area under the curve was calculated to evaluate the insulin secretion during high glucose stimulation with subtracted basal insulin secretion. Four different islet isolations with 20 islets in each condition were analyzed. Fibrin gel in vitro angiogenesis assay. Control, EC, and EC-MSC islets were placed between two layers of fibrin gel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2 g/ml thrombin; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After polymerization, EC medium supplemented with VEGF (30 ng/ml; Peprotech) was added. The islet preparations (n \u03ed 6) were cultured for 24 h, 48 h, and 3-4 days and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Sprouts were counted manually by the same person (blinded to the composition of the islet preparation), and 4 -20 islets were counted per group in each experiment. The EC sprout length was measured using Leica Qwin software (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) on pictures taken on day 4 of EC and EC-MSC islets in fibrin gel. The total EC sprout length per islet was calculated for each experiment (groups of 2-10 islets, n \u03ed 6). The mean total sprout length per islet for all the experiments (n \u03ed 6) was then calculated. The frequencies of the various sprout types were calculated by analyzing micrographs of EC-MSC islets from the fibrin gel experiments (n \u03ed 6). Immunohistochemical staining. Composite and control islets were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed in PBS, and incubated in 20% sucrose/PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C, then embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium (Tissue Tech; Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), frozen, cryosectioned, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 15 min. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using guinea pig anti-human insulin (1:400; Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa Fluor 488 -conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:100; Becton Dickinson). Counterstaining was performed with DAPI (10 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Production of DsRed-expressing lentiviral particles and lentiviral vector infection of ECs. Stocks of Discosoma species-derived red fluorescent (DsRed)-expressing lentiviral vectors (Lv-DsRed) were produced by cotransfection of three plasmids, the viral core packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.74, the VSV-G envelope protein vector pMDG.2, and the transfer vector pRRLsin-PPThCMV-MCS-wpre containing DsRed cDNA (a gift of W.T.

Morphological analysis of these cultures showed that the cells grew either on top of each other or aligned with one another, indicating interactions between the cells (Fig.  1D). Growth of ECs in double layers is an atypical phenomenon, indicating unusual growth interactions between the ECs and MSCs. Improved islet coating by combining ECs and MSCs. ECs are adherent cells that interact with the extracellular matrix. We therefore evaluated the adherence of ECs (CT orange) and MSCs (CT green) to isolated islets. After 3-h incubation of islets and ECs (EC islets), a few ECs were found to adhere to the islet surface ( Fig. 2A, left panel). Combining ECs and islets with MSCs (EC-MSC islets) had no apparent effect on the coating of the islets by ECs at this early time point ( Fig. 2A, right panel). However, after only 1 day of incubation, a threefold increase in the islet surface covered by ECs was observed in the presence of MSCs, as compared with EC islets (Fig. 2B, quantification in Fig. 2C). Morphological characterization of the ECs adhering to the islet surface repeatedly showed that the ECs flattened out and aligned themselves with the surface of the islets in the presence of MSCs (Fig. 2D). Analyses of sectioned EC islets and EC-MSC islets stained for insulin showed ECs adhering to both insulin-positive and insulinnegative cells in the islet preparations after 24 h of incubation ( Fig. 2E-G). After 4 days in suspension culture, there was a tendency toward a decrease in the islet surface area covered by ECs in both EC islets and EC-MSC islets; however, this difference did not reach statistical significance (n \u03ed 6; P \u03ed 0.16 and P \u03ed 0.06, respectively). A few cell clusters remained uncoated in all groups (Fig. 2B,  right panel, arrowheads). EC islet and EC-MSC islet survival and function. Islet loss during the process of coating was evaluated by incubation of 50 hand-picked islets with ECs and MSCs according to the coating protocol. No loss of islets was observed during the formation of EC-MSC islets; however, a gradual decrease of \u03f320% in islet number was observed in both groups during the 6-day culture period (Fig. 3A). Cytokine analysis showed insignificant differences in the levels of IL-6 (0.005 \u03ee 0.005, 0.07 \u03ee 0.06 pmol/g DNA), IL-8 (0.3 \u03ee 0.1, 0.9 \u03ee 0.04 pmol/g DNA), TF (0.1 \u03ee 0.01, 0.3 \u03ee 0.07 pmol/g DNA) and MCP-1 (0. Insulin release by EC-MSC islets showed preserved dynamics during high-glucose stimulation after 1 and 3-4 days compared with control islets (Fig. 3B-C). No significant differences were seen in the stimulation indexes between control islets and EC-MSC islets at 1 day (5,090 \u03ee 2,190 and 4,540 \u03ee 1,300 pmol \u2150 min \u03ea1 \u2150 l \u03ea1 , respectively) or 3-4 days of culture (4,560 \u03ee 1,330 and 5,090 \u03ee 800 pmol \u2150 min \u03ea1 \u2150 l \u03ea1 , respectively). Sprouting and invasion of fibrin gels. To evaluate the effect of angiogenesis, uncoated and coated islets were cultured in three-dimensional fibrin gels ( Fig. 4A and  C-D), in which ECs formed defined sprouts of patched ECs, and MSCs formed thin cords of aligned cells (21,22). After only 48 h, the total number of sprouts in the composite EC-MSC islets was higher than that in the control or EC islets. This difference remained after 3-4 days of culture (Fig. 4B).",

EC-MSC islets retained sprout formation over time, whereas in EC islets, the sprouts were disrupted and the ECs were separated from the islets (Fig. 4C-D). The median (\u03ee 1 quartile) EC sprout length in the EC-MSC islets was 900 m (700 -1,380 m) and only 680 m (300 -840 m) in the EC islets. Also, the total EC sprout length per islet was longer in the EC-MSC islets than in the EC islets (Fig. 4E). Figure 5 shows the typical morphology of sprouts emanating from a composite EC-MSC islet after 2 days in culture. At this early stage, the sprouting was characterized by a complex course of events involving EC sprouts interacting with MSCs at the EC sprout base (Fig. 5A), ECs in close contact with MSCs ( Fig. 5B-C), ECs at the leading tip of an MSC-initiated sprout (Fig. 5D), and MSCs at the leading tip of an EC sprout (Fig. 5E). ECs also migrated in groups to form a completely naked sprout with no apparent connection to the islet (Fig. 5F). Sprouts of ECs in close interaction with MSCs occurred twice as frequently as EC sprouts with nonaligned MSC cords. In the sprouts in which close cell interactions occurred between ECs and MSCs, there was a preference for ECs as the leading tip cells.",

An ingrowth of added ECs (CT orange) connecting to the native CD31-positive islet capillary network was frequently observed (Fig. 6A, arrowheads). To achieve a stable expression of DsRed, we infected the ECs with DsRed-labeled lentiviral particles. DsRed-infected ECs showed almost complete transduction after 2 weeks of culture, as visualized by merged phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy images (Fig. 6B). The proliferative capacity of the DsRed EC in response to VEGF was unaffected (data not shown). Confocal microscopy analyses of DsRed EC islets and DsRed EC-MSC islets after 6 days of suspension culture showed that the DsRed ECs had penetrated into the islets (Fig. 6C). Especially in the EC-MSC islets, the DsRed ECs had formed a dense network of capillary-like structures penetrating into the islets (Fig. 6D). The presence of DsRed ECs within the islets was scored at day 3 and 6. Whereas the EC islets had a mean score of 0.7 \u03ee 0.2, the EC-MSC islets showed a higher level of penetration, with a mean score of 1.6 \u03ee 0.4 (Fig. 6E). A comparison of the score distribution for the EC islets and EC-MSC islets showed that those with a score of 0 or 1 were predominantly EC islets, whereas the islets reaching a score of 2 or 3 were predominantly EC-MSC islets (Fig. 6F).",

The capacity of the ECs to cover the islet surface was markedly enhanced by the presence of MSCs. This effect is most likely not only a result of enhanced adherence, but also a reflection of a change in the phenotype of the ECs that allowed them to stretch toward and interact with the islet surface, together with an increase in their proliferation. Importantly, in an established in vitro model of angiogenesis, the MSCs also stimulated EC sprout formation, not only into the surrounding matrices, but also into the islets where intra-islet capillary-like structures were formed.",

As compared with the aortic ECs that were used earlier (7), microvascular ECs are less covered by pericytes and, therefore, relatively more susceptible to remodeling (24). The relative capacity of EC populations to coat microcarrier surfaces is affected by the source from which they were obtained (25) and their expression of integrins, such as \u24235\u2424 1, \u24231\u2424 1, and \u2423v\u2424 5.

            "text": "Established in vitro models of angiogenesis involve culturing ECs in three-dimensional polymers, such as fibrin or collagen gels (26,27). By using this model system, we were able to demonstrate the induction of sprout formation of ECs in the presence of MSCs, a response that could be monitored over time by confocal microscopy. Similarly, Ghajar and colleagues (8) have demonstrated stimulatory effects of MSCs on angiogenesis in threedimensional fibrin gels. The induced vessel formation was due in part to degradation of the fibrin matrix by proteases produced by the MSCs, and sprout formation was enhanced even in matrices in which the matrix density was too high for the ECs to invade when cultured alone (8). This capacity of MSCs may be of particular importance in facilitating EC migration into dense micro-organs such as islets. In addition, MSCs most likely contributed growth factors and extracellular matrix production that serve to encourage the stabilization and maturation of the EC sprouts (9). This effect of MSCs was evidenced by the increased sprout formation by EC-MSC islets in fibrin gels, where close interactions between EC sprouts and MSCs occurred to a high degree. The MSCs express plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) receptors and may respond to PDGF production by the ECs, leading to enhanced cell interactions (6,28). A majority of the EC sprouts that interacted closely with MSCs in the fibrin gel also showed a thicker sprout phenotype, suggesting that a maturation process occurred. In contrast, several of the sprouts emanating from the EC islets eventually collapsed and detached from their base at the islet surface.",

Most importantly, no additional loss of islets occurred during the formation of EC-MSC islets and their subsequent culture (6 days), when compared with untreated islets. A culture medium designed to support microvascular EC survival was applied to promote EC adhesion and proliferation on the islet surface unaffecting the islet function. Equally important is that the culture conditions applied did not promote the pro-inflammatory and procoagulant capacity of ECs (29,30), i.e, there was no difference in the level of expression of TF, IL-6, IL-8, or MCP-1 between the EC-MSC and control islets.",

Also, severely immunodeficient mice (SCID, nu/nu, and Rag) trigger strong innate immune responses that mainly target the vasculature of a transplanted organ due to the phylogenetic disparity between the two species, i.e., human-to-mouse is a discordant xenotransplantation model triggering activation of neutrophils, natural killer cells, macrophages, the complement and coagulation systems, and naturally occurring xenoreactive antibodies (32)(33)(34)(35)(36)(37)(38)(39).",
