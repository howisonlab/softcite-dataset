The suggested hypothesis implies that the process of the country's development differs depending on the stage of the development. in order to establish the relationship between the sustainable development and the economic growth, the correlation analysis was used. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were taken as the research objects and the results obtained were compared with those describing the developed countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, France, Germany). The results obtained outline the main economic trends as well as determining their variation depending on the development stage of the country.",

A lot of studies have been devoted to the new philosophy. However, there are various definitions of this phenomenon. The widely known definition states that it is the \"ability of humanity to ensure that it meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs\" (Brundtland 1987). Germination of the concept of sustainable development at institutional level has been analysed by Grybait\u0117 and Tvaronavi\u010dien\u0117 (2008). The concept of sustainable development contains three dimensions of welfare, comprising economic, environmental, social aspects and their interrelations.",

            "text": "The modern study of economic growth was started by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since then, many theories have been defining the major factors of economic growth, but three basic factors, such as capital formation, population growth, technological changes and their interactions were mainly emphasized. The role of capital formation, reflected in saving and investment has been a crucial factor in many works of economics thinkers for centuries, and it remains important even today (Tvaronavi\u010dien\u0117 2006;Tvaronavi\u010dien\u0117, Tvaronavi\u010dius 2008). During the past fifty years the term \"economic growth\" was being transformed to a new notion -economic development, emphasizing not only the growth of the quantity of material goods and services, but also a higher level of welfare of the country. it was suggested (Theobald 1961) to divide the process of economic development into five stages, which every nation can pass regardless of its social and political structure. Notably, this approach is often presented as one of the leading theories of economic development (Parr 2001). in the middle of the 20th century social capital was made a focus in the analysis of factors, influencing the economic growth. T. W. Schultz was one of the first researchers who began to treat entrepreneurship as human capital, i.e. skills obtained by investing in a particular type of human resources (Huffman 2006). The social positions of development became even more prominent with the adoption of Human Development index (Ghosh 2008). Social factor has been widely explored and now social development is considered to be a prerequisite for economic growth, while economic and social systems are often presented as one.",

The most effective theory based on the relationship between pollution and income level was developed (Bradford et al. 2005). Since then the economists have been analysing the question: \"Do poor people care less about their health than rich people? if not, what makes the populations in poor countries, generally speaking, less healthy?\" (Torras 2006). The later notion emphasizes that economic development and ecological services cannot be observed as one system, where the causality flows from both directions.",

As GDP growth is used as a basic indicator for this analysis it should be emphasized that it is different in the groups of the Baltic states and the developed countries. The growth of all three Baltic states is about four times that (except Russian crisis in 1999) of other countries analysed. This is graphically shown in Fig. 1. only the indicators with the statistically significant correlation are chosen and presented in Table 1. Correlation coefficients were calculated using the log change of sustainable development indicator and the log change of GDP (in constant prices) for the respective country. in many sources (\u010cekanavi\u010dius, Murauskas 2002) the correlation coefficient of 0.30 is described as a minimal level for the relationship to be valid, but this is only true for large data samples, more than 50 data points. For a small data sample (as in this work) the significance of the correlation coefficient can be determined by using standard distribution calculated by Student t test. Alternatively, a simple formula to determine the approximate critical value of the correlation coefficient at 0.05 level of significance was introduced (Walsh 2008):",

Climate change is linked with many areas of human activities. it requires taking some measures in many sectors from energy and transport to land use and urban development. All these measures, if successfully managed, result in sustainable development. Climate change is mostly caused by greenhouse gas emission. This indicator is strictly controlled by Kyoto protocol, however, despite this fact, it is increasing every year in most of the countries. The high rate of positive correlation between the total greenhouse gas emissions and GDP is found in the Baltic region (Lithuania -0.82, Estonia -0.35, Latvia -0.69). The relation with GDP is negative or insignificant in the developed countries. The results show that the Baltic states produce GDP using energy associated with high greenhouse gas emission. in the developed West European context the weak points of the Baltic states' sustainable development may be clearly seen. Climate change is closely related to energy consumption. Gross inland energy consumption shows the usage of various energy sources (fuel, gas, renewable energy sources, etc.). Positive significant correlation is found for Lithuania (0.64) and Latvia (0.57) with not so strong correlation observed in Estonia (0.26). Negative and significant correlation is found in Austria (-0.81), and negative but not strong correlation can be observed in Denmark (-0.39) and Netherlands (-0.49). Hence, higher consumption of fuel is closely related to the GDP growth in the Baltic states. in general, it can be seen that the Baltic region does not demonstrate the effective policy against the climate change. The results are different in the developed European countries. only Estonia show positive trends to sustainability.",

Based on the results of the correlation analysis performed using the environmental indicators, the difference in the priorities in the Baltic states and those characterizing developed countries can be defined. The Baltic region has a highly significant correlation between environmental indicators and GDP and, unfortunately, the relationship is the strongest in Lithuania. it confirms the statements of the theories that at the lower stage of development, pollution is associated with a higher GDP. in the developed countries, the relationship is often negative: the lower level of pollution is related to a higher GDP. This is a proof that the policy of sustainable development is being implemented more effectively in the developed countries, and this does not contradict to the prospect of higher economic growth in the longer perspective.
