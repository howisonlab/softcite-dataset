            "text": "The often cited need to achieve !95% (nearly perfect) adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for successful virologic outcomes in HIV may present a barrier to initiation of therapy in the early stages of HIV. This meta-analysis synthesized 43 studies (27,905 participants) performed across >26 countries, to determine the relationship between cutoff point for optimal adherence to ART and virologic outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effect model to calculate pooled odds ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The mean rate of patients reporting optimal adherence was 63.4%. Compared with suboptimal adherence, optimal adherence was associated with a lower risk of virologic failure (0.34; 95% CI: 0.26-0.44). There were no significant differences in the pooled odds ratios among different optimal adherence thresholds (!98-100%, !95%, !80-90%). Study design (randomized controlled trial vs observational study) (regression coefficient 0.74, 95% CI: 0.04-1.43, P < 0.05) and study region (developing vs developed countries; regression coefficient 0.56, 95% CI: 0.01-1.12, P < 0.05) remained as independent predictors of between-study heterogeneity, with more patients with optimal adherence from developing countries or randomized controlled trials experiencing virologic failure. The threshold for optimal adherence to achieve better virologic outcomes appears to be wider than the commonly used cutoff point (!95% adherence). The cutoff point for optimal adherence could be redefined to a slightly lower level to encourage the prescribing ART at an early stage of HIV infection.

Search Strategy WB carried out systematic literature searches of the electronic databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Clinical Trials, and EMBASE from their inception date to 17 April 2015. This search used combinations of the following key words: medication adherence, patient compliance, antiretroviral therapy, antiretroviral agent, antiretroviral treatment, protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, virologic failure, and viral load. The reference lists of all articles included in this meta-analysis were also searched. Review articles, editorials, commentaries, government reports, and guidelines were excluded from this review.

            "text": "H IV/AIDS has been transformed into a manageable chronic disease with the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiated as the standard of care. 1 Three classes of HIV medications have been widely used in combinationnucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). 1 Despite the availability of effective treatment options, suboptimal adherence to treatment can result in insufficient viral suppression and promote the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains, resulting in regimen failure, progression to AIDS, and death. [2][3][4] Paterson et al suggested that at least 95% adherence to unboosted PIs was required for virologic suppression. 5 This 95% adherence cut-off point, based on what is now obsolete therapy, has been widely used as the level of optimal adherence needed to be met by patients taking newer agents and their combinations. The concern that patients may not achieve a near-perfect adherence presents a barrier for initiation of therapy in the early stages of HIV. 6 This meta-analysis integrated finding from observational studies on ART adherence with 2 objectives: (a) to critically evaluate the association between optimal adherence to ART and virologic outcomes, and (b) to use meta-regression to determine methodological, regimen, and population factors that could moderate the relationship between adherence and virologic outcomes.",

Study authors' grouping of patients into optimal and suboptimal adherence using the most objective measure was used. When a study reported >1 adherence measurement, the most reliable adherence measurement data was used, with reliability defined in following order: medication event monitoring system (MEMS) > pill count > pharmacy refill > self-reported adherence in the past week > self-reported adherence in the past month. When the number of virologic failures within each adherence group was not reported, we calculated virologic failure from the information provided in the paper or contacted the corresponding author.

Results are presented based on 9 categories, including study region, antiretroviral regimen, treatment experience, virologic failure cut-off points, adherence cut-off points, adherence measurement, study design, observation period, and year of publication. Adherence pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a random effect model (DerSimonian and Lard) 9 that accommodated the random variation within studies and between-studies. 10 Heterogeneity between-studies were examined using the Q and I 2 statistics. 9,11 The odds ratio was plotted against the inverse of standard error to identify the risk of publication bias by visually assessing the symmetry of funnel plots. Statistical significance was confirmed using Egger's test, 12 with a P value <0.05 considered suggestive of publication bias. A metaregression was performed to examine major moderators of the between-studies heterogeneity. Results with P values <0.1 from univariate analyses were included in the multivariate meta-regression model.",

Thirty studies (70%) defined optimal adherence as !95%, with the remainder using 100%, 98%, 90%, 85%, and 80% as the cut-off points. Optimal adherence rates varied greatly across studies, partially due to the use of these different cut-off points and also different methods of measurement to assess adherence.

This study revealed that adherence levels as low as 80% to 90% may be adequate for viral suppression in patients taking newer antiretroviral drugs. Our data also showed that pooled odds ratios for virologic failure for optimal adherence compared to suboptimal adherence were similar between NNRTI-based and boosted PI-based regimens. The effectiveness of newer antiretroviral agents at the lower level of adherence may encourage the prescribing of ART at an early stage of HIV infection. The findings indicated that the mean proportion of patients who were reported to demonstrate optimal adherence worldwide was 63.4%, which is similar to a meta-analysis of 84 studies that reported 62% of patients take !90% of their prescribed ART. 55 The results of this study demonstrate that adherence is robustly associated with virologic outcomes across the various types of adherence measure, ART regimen, study population, and reporting. The odds of virologic failure were almost 3 times higher for participants with suboptimal adherence compared with those with optimal adherence. This confirms that achieving long-term optimal adherence is indeed Achilles' heel of successful virologic outcomes. 56 The need for   clinicians to exert concerted efforts to maintain continuing optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy is indisputable. Classifying patients according to various optimal adherence thresholds (!98-100%, !95%, and 80-90%) did not result in statistically significant differences in the odds of virologic failure. This finding is consistent with a meta-analysis of 37 studies in children that reported no significant group differences in virologic outcomes between different thresholds of good adherence. 57 This suggests that patients who achieved ''perfect'' (100%) or ''near perfect'' (!95%) adherence did not necessarily have better virologic outcomes than patients who had achieved ''good enough'' (!80-90%) adherence. This finding has clinical importance and is in line with previous studies 58,59 that indicated that although the need to maintain high levels of adherence to achieve long-term virologic suppression is clear, the level of adherence behavior capable of sustaining viral suppression is broader than previously thought.",

The rate of virologic failure detected in patients with good adherence increased when studies defined a virologic failure at a low level of HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA). The relationship between adherence and viral load improved when the level of detection of HIV-1 RNA increased. The tighter the definition of virologic failure the more likely it is to unmask suboptimal adherence. The odds of virologic failure for optimal adherence were about half and one-third that of the patients with suboptimal adherence in countries with a low HDI and high HDI, respectively. More patients with optimal adherence experienced virologic failure in countries with low HDI than in countries with high HDI. This review indicates that patients with equal or better levels of optimal adherence in developing countries compared to developed countries 62 does not necessarily translate into better virologic outcomes. This might be associated with the increase in pretreatment antiretroviral drug resistance 63 and unavailability of baseline HIV drug resistance testing before initiation of ART 64 in resource-limited settings that have a potential to contribute to the increasing rates of virologic failure in optimally adherent patients.

More patients with optimal adherence experienced virologic failure in randomized controlled trials than in observational studies. Differences in estimated magnitude of treatment effect are very common between randomized controlled trials and observational studies. 66 This difference in virologic outcomes between study designs might be related with selection bias in observational studies 67 and higher quality and rigor of randomized controlled trials.",

We only included studies published in English, so we may have missed studies that were relevant to our research question during the literature search. When the included studies were stratified and analyzed based on regimen, virologic failure cutoff, adherence cut-off and type of adherence measurement, heterogeneity between-studies remained high for most of the subgroups. Because of this high degree of heterogeneity, which was not entirely described either by subgroup analysis or by meta-regression, our pooled results need to be viewed with caution."

The threshold for optimal adherence to achieve better virologic outcomes appears to be wider than the commonly used cut-off point (!95% adherence). Though patients taking ART should be instructed to attain !95% adherence, apprehensions of slightly lower adherence should not deter prescribing ART regimens at an early stage of HIV infection. "
