It is therefore a priority for safety pharmacology teams to detect block of cardiac ion channels, and new technologies have enabled the development of automated and high-throughput screening assays using cell lines. As a result of screening multiple ion-channels there is a need to integrate information, particularly for compounds affecting more than one current, and mathematical electrophysiology in-silico action potential models are beginning to be used for this. Methods-We quantified the variability associated with concentration-effect curves fitted to recordings from high-throughput Molecular Devices IonWorks\u00ae Quattro\u2122 screens when detecting block of I Kr (hERG), I Na (NaV1.5), I CaL (CaV1.2), I Ks (KCNQ1/minK) and I to (Kv4.3/ KChIP2.2), and the Molecular Devices FLIPR\u00ae Tetra fluorescence screen for I CaL (CaV1.2), for control compounds used at AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. We examined how screening variability propagates through in-silico action potential models for whole cell electrical behaviour, and how confidence intervals on model predictions can be estimated with repeated simulations. Results-There are significant levels of variability associated with high-throughput ion channel electrophysiology screens. This variability is of a similar magnitude for different cardiac ion currents and different compounds. Uncertainty in the Hill coefficients of reported concentrationeffect curves is particularly high. Depending on a compound's ion channel blocking profile, the uncertainty introduced into whole-cell predictions can become significant."

It is therefore a priority for safety pharmacology teams to detect these interactions as early as possible during drug development. As such, it is now common for pharmaceutical companies to perform high-throughput screening (HTS) on large numbers of novel compounds, early in development, to detect whether they block cardiac ion channels (Pollard et al., 2010). Discovering that a lead compound carries a high cardiac risk at later stages of development is very costly.",

This method is resource intensive and technically challenging, consequently it has a throughput that is far too low to be of commercial use during early drug discovery, when a large number of compounds need to be screened. To some extent, this problem has been overcome in recent years with the development of dedicated planar array high-throughput electrophysiology platforms. These platforms allow high precision recordings of ion-current inhibition by compounds, while being amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS)."

We are therefore considering only the variability in 'acceptable' measurements, not across all the measurements that were taken. For discussion of typical quality control criteria used in these assays please see Bridgland-Taylor et al. (2006), Harmer et al. (2008), and Davies et al. (2012). Whilst the concentration-effect curves consistently detect the compound's blockade of I Kr , it is immediately evident that there is substantial variability between individual curves shown in Fig. 1. Our use of the term 'variability' is intended to represent the variation in IC 50 values and Hill coefficients fitted to concentration-effect curves recorded by HTS assays that are carried out on separate occasions. Indeed, HTS is thought to provide more variable results than the 'gold-standard' of manual patch clamp, and we seek to characterise this HTS variability in this study.",

The cell can then be voltage clamped and currents across the membrane are measured by a 48 channel amplifier. Separate measurements can be taken from each well using this method.",

This protocol can be utilised on IonWorks\u2122 Quattro and Barracuda machines and allows for more accurate recordings. In PPC mode, each PatchPlate\u2122 is perforated by many holes allowing one amplifier to take recordings from up to 64 different cells. The recorded current is then the mean current from a number of cells. This dramatically improves consistency in the recordings, by helping to overcome some of the inter-cell variability that has been observed with the single-hole approach (Finkel et al., 2006). All of the data discussed in this study were acquired using the IonWorks Quattro in the PPC mode, as described in Supplementary material S1. In brief, cells were placed into wells at a concentration of between 1 and 5 million cells/ml (depending on the HTS target), cells were incubated in the presence of the test compound for 3-5 min before measurements were taken, and compounds were tested up to the limit of solubility.",

The first cardiac action potential models were developed over 50 years ago (Noble, 1962), and models now exist for multiple species and types of cardiac myocyte (Noble, Garny, & Noble, 2012). These cellular models have also been integrated into models of tissue electrophysiology to predict the path of electrical waves up to the whole heart scale (Clayton et al., 2011).

A possible exception to this is the NaV1.5 IonWorks screen, that shows slightly higher variability in the pIC 50 spread associated with different compounds. Ideally data would be acquired on additional NaV1.5 control compounds to characterise this assay further. In the absence of any further information, we keep the same assumption for the CaV1.2 IonWorks and I to screens, for which data were only available for one control compound each. Table 1 show that the variability associated with Hill coefficients fitted to HTS results is considerable (but the level of variability is consistent between different compounds in a given assay).
