In the present report, the unique case of a 14 year-old female with metastatic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (formerly, malignant melanotic schwannoma) of the parotid gland, who experienced a durable response and sustained tumor control with Rexin-G \u00ae , a tumor-targeted retroviral expression vector encoding an anti-cyclin G1 construct, is described. Post-parotidectomy, and prior to the administration of Rexin-G \u00ae , the patient received various chemotherapy regimens, including doxorubicin, ifosfamide, temozolomide, sorafenib, and an immunological therapy with interleukin-2, which only resulted in the further progression of lung metastases. The patient subsequently participated in a Phase 1/2 gene therapy study, during which she received intravenous Rexin-G \u00ae as monotherapy for two years with minimal drug-associated adverse events. Currently, the patient has no evidence of active disease 9 years after commencing the Rexin-G \u00ae treatment, and with no additional anti-cancer therapy. In conclusion, Rexin-G \u00ae may be a viable therapeutic option for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and should be further investigated in prospective histology-specific clinical trials for this type, and possibly other types, of chemotherapy-resistant sarcoma.",

            "text": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST; formerly, melanotic schwannoma) is a rare neoplasm of Schwann cell origin capable of melanogenesis (1,2). Clinicopathologically, it is considered a distinct entity from conventional schwannoma due to genetic and clinical differences (3). Immunophenotypic indicators for schwannomas with melanotic differentiation include the presence of epitheloid cells with variably sized nuclei, and a marked accumulation of melanin (2), but differential diagnosis typically requires further analysis through ultrastructural and immunohistochemical testing. In terms of clinical management, it is of paramount importance to distinguish primary melanin-containing lesions from malignant melanoma in order to plan an appropriate therapeutic approach.",

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the face and neck revealed a 5.3 cm mass of the right parotid gland, and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed several small, non-specific opacities in the upper right lobe. A histopathological examination performed by core needle biopsy revealed a malignant melanotic spindle cell neoplasm, with atypical spindle cell proliferation arranged in a fascicular pattern. The tumor was histologically and immunophenotypically consistent with MPNST. The patient underwent a right radical parotidectomy and a right modified radical neck dissection with reconstructive surgery. Note was made of the extension of the neoplasm into the soft tissues around the parotid gland with perineural invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis, with the involvement of three out of eight tumorous lymph nodes staining positive for laminin, homatropine methylbromide 45 (HMB-45), and tyrosinase, and negative for melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells (MART-1) and S-100 protein. In March 2007, the patient started chemotherapy with temozolomide (75 mg/m 2 given orally, daily for 45 days), and in April 2007, sorafenib (40 mg by mouth, twice daily), due to the increased sizes of nine lung lesions. In spite of these treatments, however, Rexin-G \u00ae , a tumor-targeted retrovector for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: A case report a repeat positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan in June 2007 revealed diffuse progression in the lungs, thighs, and left flank. The patient was admitted for treatment with high-dose interleukin-2, but only received 7 of 14 doses due to unacceptable toxicity and disease progression. After three cycles of ifosfamide (1,800 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days) as continuous infusion with mesna, and doxorubicin (37.5 mg/m 2 /day intravenously for 2 days), a repeat PET/CT scan revealed further tumor progression; therefore, the chemotherapy was discontinued.",

NCT00505713; see Table I). The patient received dose level 3 of Rexin-G \u00ae [3x10e 11 colony-forming units (cfu)] three times a week as an outpatient. Objective tumor responses were evaluated by a number of parameters, including Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1 (4), tumor volume, mm 3 (length x width 2 x 0.52), tumor density in Hounsfeld units (HU) and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max ) by fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG) PET-CT (4,5). Based on the RECIST v1 and other radiological parameters, the patient experienced sustained disease control (Fig. 1). The patient's clinical course was complicated by an episode of nephrotic syndrome, which was attributed to the bi-weekly subcutaneous granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) injections, and therefore these were discontinued. The patient received a total of 205 Rexin-G \u00ae vector infusions over a 2-year period with minimal toxicity and no serious adverse events. Following the last infusion in June 2010, the patient underwent a PET/CT scan, comparing the results with those images taken prior to treatment. The radiology report stated that there was a marked overall improvement in the patient's pulmonary metastases, with all but one nodule being either markedly improved in size, or resolved. It was also noted that the right pleural effusion and previous significant ascites had been resolved. Currently, nine years after commencing the Rexin-G \u00ae treatment, the patient is alive and well, with no evidence of active neoplastic disease.",

These tumors occur most frequently at nerve roots, although other locations along the peripheral nervous system have been described (8). Tumors originating from the bone, soft tissues, heart, mouth, esophagus, bronchus, retroperitoneum, uterine cervix, orbit, parotid gland, as well as the spinal cord, acoustic nerve, cerebellum, and sympathetic chain, have been reported (1,9). Statistics have revealed a 1.1:1 male: female ratio (9). The ages of those afflicted vary between 10 and 84 years (7,9), although the peak incidence occurs with patients in their fourth decade (7). There have been fewer than 200 cases of PNST reported since it was first described in 1932 (10,11), with approximately 40 reported malignancies as of 2014 (12). To date, there have been no published cases of MPNST originating from the parotid gland. Therefore, this case is unique and worthy of report, particularly with respect to the patient's impressive response to an innovative tumor-targeted gene therapy vector, designated Rexin-G \u00ae .",

All reported cases of MPNST, including the present patient's case, have revealed positive gene expression of HMB-45 and tyrosinase, indicative of melanocytic differentiation, but negative expression of MART-1 and S-100 protein, thereby eliminating a diagnosis of melanoma (14). Further studies for the expression of laminin, which was displayed intensely in two-thirds of the reported cases (15), concluded that the tumor represented a Schwannian differentiation, based on the biphasic pattern (i.e. individual cell and nested) in the external lamina.",

The results of these studies demonstrated the overall safety and, in clinical trials for sarcoma and pancreatic cancer, the dose-dependent efficacy in controlling tumor growth and improving survival rates with the use of Rexin-G \u00ae , particularly at the higher dose levels (Table I). Accordingly, long-term survival follow-up (up to 15 years post-treatment) is required by the US FDA for investigational gene therapy products; to date, there have been no reports of delayed or late adverse events associated with Rexin-G \u00ae treatment.",

On the basis of these results, the continued development of Rexin-G \u00ae for this rare type of mesenchymal cancer, and potentially other chemoresistant sarcomas, is highly recommended.",
