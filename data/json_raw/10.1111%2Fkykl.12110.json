            "text": "Over the last 15 years, China has become a major economic partner of sub-Saharan African countries. 1 China is now Africa's largest trade partner and the largest developing country to invest in Africa. Apart from that, China provides increasing financial and technical assistance to African countries. Over the same period of time, Africa's growth performance has improved significantly. Following two decades of negative growth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita grew by an annual average of 2.4 percent in 2000-2009, while the growth rate in 2010-2012 amounted to 1.8 percent (World Bank, 2014a). Obviously, various factors have contributed to Africa's better growth performance, including a marked improvement in institutions, education and infrastructure and a decrease in conflicts and macroeconomic distortions (AfDB et al., 2013; UNECA, 2013). Still, the question arises as to whether China's engagement has also made a significant contribution to economic growth in Africa. This is the main focus of this paper. We single out the impact of Sino-African economic linkages on the African growth performance for two main reasons. Firstly, starting from a relatively low base, China has become Africa's largest trading partner and largest (developing country) investor within only a couple of years. This acts as a classical economic shock that should have an impact on growth rates. Secondly, China's approach towards African countries differs from high-income countries in terms of trade structure and technology spillovers through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). As a consequence, we could expect diverging economic effects. At the same time, China also differs from other developing (or emerging market) economies, such as India or Brazil, that engage in Africa. China's trading and investment links with Africa are much more intensive",

            "text": "In theory, China's activities in Africa could have positive or negative consequences for African countries. To begin with, it is important to note that China's economic activities have resulted in an overall increase of trade, FDI, and aid in Africa rather than a diversion of existing flows from third countries. In principle, this should have positive effects. An expansion of international trade with a new partner like China could boost growth rates by increasing demand for African products (mainly raw materials). Also, the diversification of Africa's traditional trading partners could reduce export volatility, thereby decreasing output volatility and thus boosting longrun growth rates (Hnatkovska and Loayza, 2004). Furthermore, China's enormous demand for raw materials has led to higher world market prices for raw materials, improving the terms-of-trade of African exporters of natural resources (Zafar, 2007). Consumers in Africa could benefit from (additional) imports of manufactured goods from China, allowing them to cut their expenses by consuming low-cost Chinese products or increasing the variety of consumer goods available to them. Likewise, African producers could take advantage of low-cost Chinese inputs in their production process rather than importing goods and technologies from \"Northern\" countries that may be too expensive or advanced (He, 2013).",

It is expected to enlarge the capital stock in African countries, to increase productivity levels through higher competition intensities, and it is associated with higher tax revenues (UNCTAD, 2006). Also, foreign investment could foster productivity spillovers to African firms. In contrast to North-South FDI, spillovers from South-South FDI could be even larger, as Chinese firms use technologies that may be more appropriate for African firms. Finally, Chinese economic cooperation projects establish and improve much needed infrastructure in Africa, which lowers transaction costs and thus enhances (internal and external) trade and growth rates.",

China's strong demand for raw materials paired with African economies' high dependence on the primary (resource) sector enhances the risk of encountering (or deepening) the resource curse (Carmignani and Chowdhury, 2012). An exchange rate overvaluation due to increasing exports of natural resources could crowd out manufacturing products. Extracting and exporting natural resources could lead to rent-seeking and corruption (Busse and Gr\u00f6ning, 2013). Corruption, on the other hand, may lower the level of investment and the productivity of capital stock in an economy (Swaleheen, 2007). In addition, African countries with high corruption and weak institutions may not be able to fully reap the benefits of investment for growth as investment increases growth more in countries with high institutional quality (Dort et al., 2014). This matters as most African countries have already weak institutions and China, with its \"non-interference\" policy, does not tie trade and investment to any reform conditions.",

Both exchange rate overvaluations and low-cost competition from China threaten African suppliers in manufacturing. Depending on the country considered, this applies in particular to textiles, furniture, footwear, or ceramic products (Morrissey and Zgovu, 2011). Either the home market of African suppliers could be contested by Chinese firms or African exports to third markets, for instance in Europe or America, could be displaced (Giovannetti and Sanfilippo, 2009). Summing up, there are opportunities and risks that arise from China's various activities in Africa. This calls for an empirical analysis of the growth effects in African countries.",

(2008) investigate the impact of African resource exports to China on African economic and political development. The authors find that African resource exports to the world have no effect on African growth, but exporting natural resources to China as compared to the rest of the world has large positive effects on economic growth and investment in Africa. Baliamoune-Lutz (2011) also finds that African countries exporting primary products to China benefit more in terms of growth and that imports from China have a positive effect on African growth, contradicting the wide held belief of resource curse and displacement effects. However, Giovannetti and Sanfilippo (2009) find evidence that Chinese exports displace African exports in third markets, including the European Union and the United States. On the other hand, Drummond and Liu (2013) argue that rising trading links with China have allowed African countries to diversify their export base across countries, away from advanced \"Northern\" economies, which can be viewed as a positive development. However, the authors also find that the increasing dependence on China may lead African countries to become more susceptible to spillovers from China's domestic economy. For instance, based on the authors' estimations an increase (decline) in China's domestic investment growth is associated with an increase (decline) in African countries' export growth, with the impact being greater for resource-rich economies.",

            "text": "A second group of studies concentrates on determinants and effects of Chinese FDI in Africa. To begin with, Kolstad and Wiig (2011) find that Chinese FDI predominantly flows to African countries with large natural resource endowments. Cheung et al. (2012) confirm China's resource-seeking investment motive and also find market potential, trade intensity and the presence of Chinese contracted projects to attract Chinese FDI to Africa. While Sanfilippo (2010) supports market size and resource endowment to be the main drivers of Chinese FDI, he finds that these same motives attract Chinese economic cooperation projects in Africa even more. Finally, Biggeri and Sanfilippo (2009) argue that Chinese economic activities in Africa are not only driven by a country's resource endowment or market size but also by the strategic interaction of trade, FDI and aid. For instance, Chinese infrastructure projects in a particular country increase Chinese FDI to that country, while Chinese FDI in a former period increases trade with that country in the present (or vice versa). Similar to our approach Biggeri and Sanfilippo (2009) also concentrate on the three dominant economic channels, trade, FDI and aid. However, they rather analyse how the three channels are intertwined, whereas our paper analyses the respective channels' effects on growth. Moreover, Whalley and Weisbrod (2012) analyse the impact of Chinese FDI on African growth by employing Solow growth accounting methods. Their results suggest that a significant portion of the accelerated growth in some African countries in the years immediately before and after the financial crisis can be attributed to Chinese FDI inflows. Zhang et al. (2014) also employ a growth accounting approach to examine the impact of Chinese FDI on African GDP growth. Contrary to Whalley and Weisbrod (2012), Zhang et al. (2014) find that neither total net FDI inflows nor inflows from China alone have a significant impact on African growth. Moreover, Seyoum et al. (2015) conduct a case study on Chinese FDI spillovers in Ethiopia. They find that Chinese firms are more productive than Ethiopian ones and that there are positive productivity spillovers from Chinese FDI into the Ethiopian manufacturing sector provided that absorptive capacity is high. Kaplinsky and Morris (2009b) argue that the developmental effect of Chinese FDI in Africa largely depends on strategic negotiations and the quality of governance on the part of African governments. Finally, there is some evidence that FDI from private Chinese enterprises is steadily increasing in Africa (Gu, 2009;Shen, 2013). Shen (2013) also finds that private Chinese FDI is positive for job creation but there is negative perception regarding technological transfer and mixed perception in terms of local industrialization.",

Although, numerous qualitative studies on the topic of Chinese economic and development cooperation in Africa exist (Br\u00e4utigam, 2009(Br\u00e4utigam, , 2011a(Br\u00e4utigam, , 2011b, opportunities for econometric analyses were quite limited due to severe data constraints regarding Chinese aid. However, recent efforts to create a database of Chinese official finance to Africa has resulted in a number of empirical papers on the topic (Strange et al., 2013). Overall, the existing literature establishes that although Chinese aid cannot be easily compared with Western aid, it cannot be ruled less effective or \"rogue\" (Dreher et al., 2014). Moreover, Dreher et al. (2015) argue that it is necessary to distinguish between official development assistance from China to Africa, which is driven by foreign policy agendas, and more commercially-oriented less concessional forms of Chinese financing to Africa, which is primarily driven by economic interests. Related to that, McCormick (2008) analyses the impact of aid from China compared to India, on the development of Africa. The author finds that, compared to India, China offers a wider range of financial and technical assistance to Africa. The effects of Chinese and Indian aid seem significant for African development but do depend to a large extent on the institutional and structural conditions in the recipient country.",

            "text": "With regards to trade structure Sino-African trade is largely concentrated on a few countries and product groups. In 2012 natural resources accounted for 66 percent of Africa's exports to China. 2 Major resource exporters to China in 2012 were Angola, South Africa, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Zambia. With the exception of South Africa, resource exports accounted for well over 90 percent of the aforementioned countries total exports to China, reflecting the high concentration of trade in natural resources. When looking at African imports from China, the trade pattern is mirror-inverted, that is, African countries import mainly non-resource products from China (97 percent of total imports in 2012). Africa's heavy concentration on resource exports and non-resource imports reflects a traditional Heckscher-Ohlin-type trade pattern. Africa concentrates on the export of natural resources where it has a comparative advantage, and in turn imports labour-intensive manufactured goods from China which is labour-abundant. Interestingly, South Africa's trade with   Major African host countries in terms of Chinese FDI stock are South Africa, Sudan, Nigeria, and Zambia. As is the case with Sino-African trade, Chinese FDI in Africa is also concentrated on resource-rich African economies with the exception of South Africa. Moreover, Chinese FDI is promoted by strategic national policy objectives, such as the Going Global Policy or the Forum on China Africa Cooperation, resulting in large and long-term oriented investments, complicating a comparison between Chinese FDI with FDI from the rest of the world. 4 Economic Cooperation (Aid) Additionally, Chinese aid initiatives in Africa in the form of economic or technical cooperation have also increased remarkably in the last decade. According to China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS, 2013), the turnover on economic cooperation projects in Africa reached $35 billion in 2012 compared to $1.2 billion in 2000. The Chinese government supports economic cooperation projects in Africa and often links them with FDI and trade activities further reflecting its political objectives on the continent (Biggeri and Sanfilippo, 2009;Sanfilippo, 2010). Areas of economic cooperation where China is most active in Africa include infrastructure (railways, roads, telecommunication) and facility construction projects (government buildings, stadiums, hospitals, schools) (Biggeri and Sanfilippo, 2009).",

In fact, it is rather due to an exceptionally large investment in South Africa's Standard Bank in 2008 making South Africa the country with the largest Chinese FDI stock in Africa. 4. The importance of Africa in China's foreign policy culminated in the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in 2000. The forum holds ministerial conferences every three years and is an important platform to implement specific economic policy programs with Africa. Moreover, China's \"Going-Global\" policy, announced in 2001, also contributed to the rise in Sino-African economic relations. In order to encourage foreign trade and outward FDI, the policy provides Chinese firms with easy access to loans, foreign exchange and preferential policies for taxation, imports and exports (UNCTAD and UNDP, 2007).",

Although China publishes annual data on the turnover of economic cooperation projects at a country-level, it is difficult to compare with aid disbursements from Western donors. 5 On the other hand, China's main objectives in Africa are not primarily geared towards financial aid but rather towards a form of South-South Cooperation. Chinese companies often work on contracted projects in Africa as a result of a greater finance or trade deal the Chinese government agreed upon with the government of a particular African country which entails some sort of economic or technical cooperation. In the absence of other appropriate data sources, we argue that data on economic cooperation may serve as an adequate proxy for the level of Chinese development cooperation activities in Africa.",

In order to keep the time frame of our analysis as long as possible, we computed data at a country level for 1991-1997. More specifically, we assume that the country breakdown of China's total economic cooperation before 1998 is similar to that in the period 1998-2001. As China's economic cooperation projects started soaring after the Going Global Policy in 2001, we find it reasonable to assume that in the years before 2002 the level of economic cooperation in Africa as compared to the ROW was more or less constant. Importantly, this procedure does not affect the main results reported below.

To control for business cycle effects, we compute five-year averages for all variables, which results to four observations for the period 1991 to 2010. For the lagged dependent variable, we also use information for the previous period 1986 to 1990. In further regressions, we use four-year averages (five observations for 1991 to 2010). 12 The sample consists of 43 sub-Saharan African countries, that is, all 48 countries in that region apart from Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Somalia, and South Sudan. While trade figures for Liberia are highly distorted, the last four had to be excluded due to missing data for key variables such as GDP per capita or investment, or simply did not exist as a country for the larger part of the period under consideration. In extensions and robustness checks, we both enlarge the sample by including North African countries and reduce the sample by excluding sub-Saharan African islands. 13 In terms of the methodology, we use a standard OLS fixed-effects model. This approach allows a robust estimation of the various linkages and ensures to control for unobserved time-invariant country fixed-effects. In a dynamic fixed-effects 9.

The International Country Risk Group data (PRS Group, 2014) for political risk, is available for the period in question but only covers around 30 African countries. Using this data would imply cutting our sample by one third. 11. Using the rule of law indicator in our main regressions would cut our time series by five years or 25 percent of the total. 12.

See Appendix C for the country sample. model, it is well known that the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable can lead to biased estimates (Nickell, 1981). This bias mainly affects the lagged income per capita variable, which is not the variable of principle interest in our paper. Still, the size of the impact of the various trade, FDI and aid variables of main interest could be affected, for example, by using the lagged dependent variable to calculate the long-run effects. More worryingly, there might be another bias due to the endogeneity of some of the explanatory variables. Depending on the partner country or product type, trade, FDI and aid are likely to be endogenous with respect to economic growth. To mitigate both concerns, we also use the system Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator, introduced by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998).",

            "text": "China has contributed considerably to the increase in prices of raw materials, particularly for oil and metals from Africa, which then led to an increase in the terms-of-trade. This result is supported by Farooki and Kaplinsky (2013), who also analysed the (positive) impact of China on various commodity prices. At the same time, the improvements in the terms-of-trade of African countries could also arise from lower import prices, for example, from low-cost Chinese manufactured goods, as imports of these goods increased significantly over the last 15 years. What matters is the positive correlation of changes in the termsof-trade and economic growth in African countries. 16 To analyse the terms-of-trade effects in more detail, we computed interaction terms, that is, we multiply changes in the terms-of-trade with all respective trade variables, to examine non-linear effects. While most interaction terms, whether at an aggregated or disaggregated level are not significant, two exceptions stand out: the interaction terms with total exports to China and resource exports to China, respectively, which are positive and highly significant at the one percent level (Columns 5 and 6). This outcome is robust to including all respective interaction terms at the same time (not reported) and indicates that exporting natural resources to China indeed is associated with higher growth rates. But this result shows up either directly through changes in the terms-of-trade or indirectly through the interaction term. 17 System-GMM Results Next, we replicate all six specifications using (two-step) system GMM regressions in order to address endogeneity concerns (and the bias due to the inclusion of the lagged dependent variable). In these regressions we treat the lagged dependent variable, investment, population growth, inflation, all four total import and export variables, all non-resource import and export variables, as well as FDI and aid from the ROW as endogenous. To reduce the number of endogenous variables (and thus the number of instruments used), we set changes in the terms-of-trade, battle deaths, and all natural resource export variables as exogenous. We assume that African countries are too small to have an impact on world market prices (that is, their terms-of-trade) and that conflicts mainly have an impact on economic growth but not vice versa. Yet switching the status of both variables from exogenous to endogenous hardly affects the results. Natural resource exports are mainly driven by the fact whether a country has natural resource endowments or not. Reverse causality is less of an issue in this case. Again, the main results are not affected by declaring all trade variables 16. It is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze the impact of China on prices of manufacturing goods and raw materials in detail. See Section 4.3 for a discussion of the limitations of our approach. 17. Columns 5 and 6 are our preferred model specifications. As they include all controls, the various aggregated and disaggregated trade variables and the two interaction terms.",

As pointed out by Kolstad and Wiig (2011), Chinese FDI to Africa is not attracted by GDP as soon as South Africa is excluded from the sample. Predominately, Chinese FDI (and aid) is concentrated in African countries with large resource endowments, which is exogenous. Using a large number of instruments may overfit endogenous variables and may weaken the Hansen J-test of the instruments' joint validity. To keep the number of instruments at a minimum, we use the collapse option in STATA in all regressions (Roodman, 2009). 19 This ensures that the number of instruments is always well below the number of countries. Overall, the results, reported in Table 2, are broadly in line with the fixed-effects results. The lagged dependent variable is always significant at the one percent level. Depending on the model specification, the estimated coefficient is slightly above or below one, implying no strong evidence for convergence in sub-Saharan African countries. This finding is in line with the results of McCoskey (2002), who also found no convergence for economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, although smaller \"convergence clubs\" do exist.",

Second, we explore the heterogeneity of African countries by including interaction terms. While there are many possible variables for interaction terms, we focus on the interaction of the fundamental institutional indicator (rule of law) with all four FDI and aid variables (Columns 5 and 6). 22 As with sample variations, using four-year averages provide clear support for our main results (Columns 1 and 2 in Table 4). Sign and significance levels of all control variables are not affected much. The exception is the inflation rate, which is now negatively associated with growth rates. Regarding the variables of principle interest, we still find displacements effects for (non-resource) imports from China. Yet, total exports to the rest of the world are no longer positively correlated with growth. In contrast to the previous section, we find FDI inflows from China to be positive and significant at the ten percent level when including disaggregated trade variables (Column 2). Yet this result is not robust if we use more aggregated trade variables or lagged FDI (Columns 1, 3 and 4). Once we lag all FDI and aid variables, we obtain a positive (and significant) coefficient for aid from China (Column 3), which is, however, not robust to including the disaggregated trade indicators (Column 4). Since the estimated coefficient just falls short of the conventional ten percent significance level, there is some evidence that FDI from China could have positive growth effects but that it takes time to materialise. Lagging the aid variables indicates that aid from the ROW could be negatively associated with economic growth, but this outcome, again, is not robust to different model specifications.",

In fact, dropping investment and/or terms-of-trade and related interaction terms lead to very small changes in the significance or 25.

In addition, the mediator analysis confirms that the significant effects from these variables are not intervened (mediated) by investment or terms-of-trade. At the same time, we gain an additional result from the mediator analysis that exports to China are positively mediated by investment's effect on growth, i.e., revenues from rising exports to China increase capital in African economies which in turn can be invested to increase economic growth. 26 A detailed assessment of whether China's effect on African growth is direct or indirect through variables such as investment and terms-of-trade is an important area for further research but beyond the scope of this paper. Although we do not account for the effects of trade, FDI and aid on investment and terms-of-trade, we did include interaction variables of terms-of-trade with our trade variables.

Contrary to other empirical studies in this context, we examine the impact of the three main channels of China's activities simultaneously. Our empirical findings can be summarised as follows. Generally, FDI flows from China and the rest of the world, Chinese economic cooperation, and foreign aid from other countries seem to play no major role for African countries' economic development. Although we do find some positive effects of Chinese economic corporation when using lagged aid flows, these results are not robust. Sino-African trade, however, has an important impact. Our results indicate that African imports from China, particularly non-resource imports, have a negative impact on economic growth in Africa. This finding is robust to using different samples and period averages as well as an instrumental variable approach. Although not robust in all specifications, African exports to the world (excluding China) are positively associated with growth in Africa. We also find that African economies that export natural resources benefit from China's rising demand for raw materials due to both positive changes in their terms-of-trade and increasing exports of natural resources to China, when using interaction terms. Finally, our results indicate that there is some heterogeneity in the country sample. African countries with a stronger rule of law benefit more from aid from the ROW and from Chinese FDI.",

This applies to African producers importing low-cost intermediate goods from China as well. Therefore, welfare levels of consumers rise and producers can be more competitive. In contrast, we find strong evidence for displacement effects, as African producers might not be able to compete with their Chinese counterparts. This applies in particular to specific labour-intensive manufactured goods, such as textiles, footwear or furniture, where African producers have had a considerable market share in local markets so far (Morrissey and Zgovu, 2011). While a temporary increase in trade protection levels (tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers) could allow African producers to keep market shares, a suitable (long-run) policy option must be grounded on an increase in competitiveness levels. In this regard, African firms are far behind their Chinese competitors. These displacement effects have to be seen in perspective as Chinese firms dominate many sectors/product categories where there are no African competitors. Still, the question arises whether China's rise on world markets may obstruct export opportunities for African firms in (other) labour-intensive products, partly by export diversification or by moving up the value chain. So far, the evidence is not that favourable for African countries, as China (and other Asian countries) may block that market segment (Kaplinsky and Morris, 2009a).",

The insignificant results from our regressions concerning FDI from both China and the rest of the world may point to an insufficient FDI environment in African countries rather than a display of FDI not playing a role for African growth. So far, most foreign investment in Africa has been resource-seeking FDI with few linkages to other sectors. African governments should thus focus on attracting efficiency-seeking (or vertical) FDI by creating a better environment for the private sector. This could be achieved by providing a simpler and more transparent regulatory environment, building and upgrading infrastructure, enhancing educational levels and/or offering investment incentives, such as tax exemptions or the establishment of Special Economic Zones that have worked in other developing countries, most notably China. African governments have to ensure that they harness the potentially positive effects of foreign investment. So far, Chinese investment is often isolated from the rest of the local economy. Improving linkages between foreign firms and the domestic economy is thus vital to improve the growth effects of foreign investment. This could improve technology spillovers to domestic firms. Similar to trade, African governments should target specific sectors that are important for economic development and then direct foreign investment to these sectors. This could enhance productive capacity and domestic investment, boost local employment levels, and foster the integration of African firms into the global economy (UNCTAD, 2010). Importantly, a coherent regional integration policy and framework would be highly important to both increase FDI flows and enhance the spillover effects.",

Although widely criticized by Western donors for its aid practices in African countries (with poor human rights and/or governance records), China's economic cooperation projects provide a viable alternative for many African countries. This implies that Western donors may have to adjust their aid policies in Africa to a growing Chinese presence on the continent. For African policymakers, on the other hand, it implies that they could be less dependent on Western aid and the conditions attached.
