We identified ASYN in oligodendrocyte lineage progenitors isolated from the rodent brain, in oligodendrocytes generated from embryonic stem cells, and in induced pluripotent stem cells produced from fibroblasts of a healthy individual and patients diagnosed with MSA or PD, in cultures in vitro. Notably, we observed a significant decrease in ASYN during oligodendrocyte maturation. Additionally, we show the presence of transcripts in PDGFRA/CD140a + cells and SOX10 + oligodendrocyte lineage nuclei isolated by FACS from rodent and human healthy and diseased brains, respectively. Our work identifies ASYN in oligodendrocyte lineage cells, and it offers additional in vitro cellular models that should provide significant insights of the functional implication of ASYN during oligodendrocyte development and disease."

            "text": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative diseases that are hallmarked at the cellular level by the presence of alpha-synuclein (ASYN) protein containing inclusions. Interestingly, the inclusions are found in neurons in PD, where the SNCA gene encoding for ASYN protein is expressed, whereas they are prominent in oligodendrocytes as glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in MSA (Papp et al., 1989;Stefanova et al., 2009). Because strong evidence showing that oligodendrocytes in the adult brain are capable of expressing SNCA is lacking, recent studies inspired from parkinsonian experimental models have proposed the interesting hypothesis that ASYN present in GCIs in MSA could be of neuronal origin and transfer to oligodendrocytes (Kisos et al., 2012;Reyes et al., 2014), where it would accumulate and potentially lead to oligodendrocyte dysfunction. However, more than a decade ago, Richter-Landsberg and coworkers reported on the transient expression of Snca in cultures enriched in oligodendrocytes, prepared by mechanical shaking of mixed rat glial primary brain cultures (Richter-Landsberg et al., 2000). This finding, however, was neither confirmed nor further explored, and in vivo evidences of ASYN expression during oligodendrocyte maturation are still missing. Consequently, follow-up studies mainly focused on understanding the functional consequences of wild-type or mutant human ASYN targeted expression in oligodendrocytes in experimental models in vivo and in vitro (Kragh et al., 2013;Yazawa et al., 2005).",

Enrichment in oligodendrocyte progenitors is assessed by the quantification of Pdgfra transcripts and the absence of astrocytic Gfap and mature oligodendrocytic Mbp transcripts. Mean \u00b1 SEM; n = 2-3 independent experiments. (E) Experimental approach used for assessing ASYN expression during rodent oligodendrocyte development. The mESCs were derived from a blastocyste aged E3.5 and subsequently differentiated into oligodendrocytes for a period of 4-5 weeks in vitro. with PD is still elusive, we generated iPSCs from fibroblasts ( Figure 3A) of MSA patients diagnosed with cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C, patient 4) or parkinsonism (MSA-C, patient 6), a patient diagnosed with a familial form of PD (patient 3), and a healthy individual (patient 9), and assessed ASYN expression in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Figure 3A). All iPSC clones selected were expanded and cryopreserved. Random clones were selected and processed for further analysis. Thus, clones CSC-3A, B, G, and S; CSC-4A and B; CSC-6A; and CSC-9A and B underwent rigorous characterization through a battery of tests (summarized in Figure S3), which indicated that we had effectively generated iPSCs.",

            "text": "We attempted to generate oligodendrocytes from our iPSC lines. To rule out the possibility of chromosomal abnormalities influencing ASYN expression in iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes, we selected one clone per patientspecific iPSC line presenting a normal karyotype to carry out most of our investigations. We devised a protocol, modified from that of Stacpoole and coworkers (Stacpoole et al., 2013), where we employed dual inhibition of SMAD signaling by small molecules LDN and SB to neutralize our cultures, sonic hedgehog-mediated ventral patterning, and PDGF-AA/IGF1/NT3/T3/HGF-mediated terminal differentiation. This modified protocol, proven efficient when applied to the human ESC lines H13 and H3 ( Figure S4; data not shown), successfully produced oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocytes from iPSCs. Thus, by 60 days in vitro (DIV), nearly all SOX10 + cells co-expressed NKX2.2 and OLIG2, NG2, and PDGFRA and O4 ( Figures S5A-S5C and S6A), and those cells exhibited in majority an immature-bipolar morphology where ASYN could clearly be identified by confocal microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot (Figures 3B and 3C; Figures S5  and S6). Additionally, ASYN could be detected in neurons ( Figure S5D), whereas it was absent in astrocytes (Fig-ure S5E). Interestingly, from 65 DIV onward, O4 + oligodendrocytes displayed a perinuclear localization of ASYN ( Figures 3D and 3E), as we observed for mouse O4 + oligodendrocytes (Figures 1 and 2). In cultures aged 110 DIV, ASYN expression could still be detected in a few CNPASE + and MBP + mature oligodendrocytes ( Figure 3D), sometimes as a perinuclear dot ( Figure S6C; data not shown). Interestingly, the disease lines CSC-4A, CSC-4B, and CSC-3G gave rise to an accelerated high-yield generation of O4 + oligodendrocytes (up to 70% of live single cells) in 70 DIV ( Figure 3E). Finally, we confirmed the decrease in ASYN in O4 + oligodendrocytes over time ( Figure 3F) and the presence of SNCA transcripts in FACS-purified O4 + oligodendrocytes from the line CSC-3S aged 80 DIV ( Figure 3G).",

Because MSA has been identified as a nongenetic disorder, it is difficult to propose an explanation for the origin of ASYN in GCIs present in oligodendrocytes under pathological condition. This has led to the emergence of a hypothesis advocating a mechanism of cell-to-cell transfer of exogenous ASYN to oligodendrocytes, similar to that experimentally established from neuron-to-neuron in PD models (Hansen et al., 2011). However, the recent use of more advanced techniques, such as laser-capture micro-dissection, has allowed for the isolation of adult white matter glia from human postmortem tissue, resulting in the detection of SNCA tran-scripts from MSA, idiopathic PD, and control cases (Asi et al., 2014).",

We could not detect ASYN expression in astrocytes and microglia, which are cell types known to take up exogenous ASYN (Boza-Serrano et al., 2014;Lee et al., 2010). Moreover, the few neurons present in cultures combined with the multitude of media changes applied during the culture period, and the discovery of Snca/SNCA transcripts in freshly isolated oligodendrocytes and ASYN protein in homogenous cultures of freshly isolated, maturing PDGFRA/CD140a + oligodendrocyte progenitors, together allow us to rule out the possibility that healthy or dying neurons, even contaminating neurons, may have released large quantities of ASYN, which would accumulate, not being sufficiently degraded, in the oligodendrocytes only. Moreover, we showed relocation of ASYN during oligodendrocyte differentiation from the processes to the perinuclear space, where the protein appears as a single dot-like structure suggesting it is finally degraded.",

This observation, although made in vitro, may allow us to rule out that the origin of ASYN in GCIs in MSA, and glial inclusions in PD, may result from the accumulation of a lifetime production of ASYN throughout glial lineages.",
