Design: Cross-sectional population database analysis. Methods: Data on all dispensed drugs in 2010 to the entire Swedish population (9.3 million inhabitants) were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. All pharmacological groups with ambulatory care prescribing accounting for >75% of the total volume in Defined Daily Doses and a prevalence of >1% were included in the analysis. Crude and ageadjusted differences in prevalence and incidence were calculated as risk ratios (RRs) of women/men. Results: In all, 2.8 million men (59%) and 3.6 million women (76%) were dispensed at least one prescribed drug during 2010. Women were dispensed more drugs in all age groups except among children under the age of 10. The largest sex difference in prevalence in absolute numbers was found for antibiotics that were more common in women, 265.5 patients (PAT)/1000 women and 191.3 PAT/1000 men, respectively. This was followed by thyroid therapy (65.7 PAT/1000 women and 13.1 PAT/1000 men) and antidepressants (106.6 PAT/1000 women and 55.4 PAT/1000 men). Age-adjusted relative sex differences in prevalence were found in 48 of the 50 identified pharmacological groups. The pharmacological groups with the largest relative differences of dispensed drugs were systemic antimycotics (RR 6.6 CI 6.4 to 6.7), drugs for osteoporosis (RR 4.9 CI 4.9 to 5.0) and thyroid therapy (RR 4.5 CI 4.4 to 4.5), which were dispensed to women to a higher degree. Antigout agents (RR 0.4 CI 0.4 to 0.4), psychostimulants (RR 0.6 CI 0.6 to 0.6) and ACE inhibitors (RR 0.7 CI 0.7 to 0.7) were dispensed to men to a larger proportion. Conclusions: Substantial differences in the prevalence and incidence of dispensed drugs were found between men and women. Some differences may be rational and desirable and related to differences between the sexes in the incidence or prevalence of disease or by biological differences. Other differences are more difficult to explain on medical grounds and may indicate unequal treatment.",

            "text": "the most important treatment options for most diseases and the majority of medical consultations result in a prescription. 1 Furthermore, pharmaceuticals also constitute a significant proportion of healthcare spending, increasing more rapidly than other healthcare components in many countries. 2 3 In Sweden, pharmaceuticals accounted for 12.6% of the total healthcare expenditure in 2010, 4 but the growth has been moderated after the implementation of major reforms. 5 Rational drug use implies that 'patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and the community'. 6 Individual requirements indicate that severity of disease, comorbidity, renal function and age should be considered in addition to sex and gender. While it is evident that biological differences, commonly referred to as 'sex differences', should be considered when prescribing medicines, it is unclear to what extent sociocultural differences, commonly referred to as 'gender differences', should be considered by the prescribing physician. Sex differences in drug use have been demonstrated in several therapeutic areas. [7][8][9][10][11] However, there is a lack of both comprehensive overviews on sex and gender differences of drug use in entire populations and especially studies analysing the rationale behind the observed differences. Variations in morbidity may explain some differences, whereas other differences may indicate inequities and underuse or overuse of certain drugs in men or women. WHO defines 'drug utilisation' as 'the marketing, distribution, prescription, and use of drugs in a society, with special emphasis on the medical, social, and economic consequences'. 12 Drug utilisation data can be derived from different levels in the medication use process: sales data from the manufacturers to wholesalers, the dispensing data at pharmacies or patient consumption surveys. 13 14 The use of dispensed prescriptions as a measure of drug exposure has many advantages since it eliminates recall bias and improves the accuracy of the information on drug use. 13 15 In 2005, a national registry on dispensed drugs to the entire Swedish population was established. 16 It contains complete data (>99% coverage) with unique identifiers of all prescribed drugs dispensed to the entire Swedish population of 9.3 million inhabitants, and may offer a good opportunity to study sex differences in drug use.",

All 89 Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) second level groups with drugs available on the Swedish market 17 18 were identified. 2. In large ATC groups and ATC groups with drugs used for multiple heterogeneous indications, that is, cardiac therapy (C01), agents acting on the reninangiotensin system (C09), sex hormones (G03), urologicals (G04), analgesics (N02), psycholeptics (N05), psychoanaleptics (N06), ophthalmologicals (S01), a subdivision was done to the ATC third or fourth level to attain a more clinically relevant description of the utilisation. 3. ATC groups with less than 75% of the total sales volume in the country purchased on prescription were excluded since sex distribution was not possible to collect for those purchased over-the-counter or used in inpatient care. Volume was measured in the technical unit numbers of Defined Daily Doses (DDDs), except for eight pharmacological groups for which there were no DDDs assigned. 18 For these groups, packages were used as a volume measure. Calculations of the proportion of the total volume dispensed as prescriptions in ambulatory care were based on aggregated volume data from all Swedish pharmacies. 4. For the identified ATC groups at various hierarchical levels, groups that were dispensed to less than 1% of the total Swedish population or to less than 0.4% of men or women, respectively, were excluded to avoid random variation due to small numbers. Crude and age-adjusted values were calculated. Age standardisation was performed by direct standardisation, where the Swedish population on 31 December 2009 (4 649 014 men and 4 691 668 women 19 ) was used as the standard population. In the calculations, 5-year age groups were used. Differences between the sexes were calculated as a risk ratio (RR) of women/men with 95% CI.

            "text": "Throughout their lifespan, women have more contact with the healthcare system, [20][21][22] which may provide them with an extra opportunity for detecting disease and receiving prescriptions. In the premenopausal years, a woman's need for contraceptives, pregnancy and childbirth and, in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal period, screening programmes for breast and cervical cancers and gynaecological disorders require healthcare consultations. 22 Also, chronic disabling diseases associated with a chronic need for medication, such as musculoskeletal disorders, are more common in women than men. 20 From a gender perspective, studies have shown that men are less prone to seek preventive healthcare. 21 Some differences between the sexes are expected. The higher proportion of women dispensed antimycotics could partly be explained by gynaecological infections such as vaginitis. Also, the 4.5 times higher proportion of dispensed thyroid therapy corresponds to a four times higher prevalence of impaired thyroid function in women. 23 The sex difference in the proportion of dispensed drugs for migraine could be explained by a 2-3 times higher prevalence of migraine among women. 24 Men were dispensed more psychostimulants, corresponding to a higher prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 25 and autism. 26 The largest sex difference in absolute numbers was observed for antibiotics, more commonly dispensed to women. A common reason for prescribing antibiotics in primary care is urinary tract infection, which is more prevalent in women. 27 An overdiagnosis of this condition in women has, however, been reported, which could potentially explain some of the higher number of women being dispensed these drugs. 28 Women were dispensed more antiobesity drugs than men in spite of obesity being more common in men. 29 30 Also, more women than men undergo obesity surgery. 31 There are reasons to believe that the sociocultural pressure to be slim is higher for women and studies have shown that women are more dissatisfied with their weight and their body than men. 32 33 This could explain the prescription pattern.",

ACE inhibitors, primarily used for the treatment of heart failure and hypertension, with the same prevalence in both Figure 2 Pharmacological groups with the highest age-adjusted relative differences in prevalence in 2010.  sexes, were more commonly dispensed to men. This may be due to the higher frequency of coughing as an adverse event in women. 34 However, the alternative treatment ARB was dispensed to women and men to the same extent. Our findings may therefore indicate an underuse of renin-angiotensin agents in women. Lipid lowering drugs were also dispensed more frequently to men. The higher proportion in men may be explained by the higher prevalence of ischaemic heart disease. However, studies have shown that these drugs are underused for secondary prevention in women. [35][36][37][38] Reasons for this could be that women not only suffer more from myalgia as an adverse reaction 39 but also that women are older and have more comorbidity when suffering from cardiovascular disease, thus receiving less intensive secondary preventive medication. Men were dispensed more anticoagulants. The most common indication for anticoagulants is atrial fibrillation, a condition more commonly found in men but carrying a higher risk of fatal complications like embolic stroke for women. 40 Underuse of anticoagulants in women with atrial fibrillation has been shown in earlier studies. 37 38 41-44 Men were also dispensed antiarrhythmic drugs to a higher degree than women. This may be appropriate as women have a higher risk of the fatal arrhythmia 'torsade de pointe-ventricular tachycardia' induced by some antiarrhythmics like sotalol and quinidine. 45 The main strength of this study is the complete coverage of all dispensed prescription drugs to the entire Swedish population. This provides a population-based overview of drug use difficult to acquire in many other health systems. 15 Although it is important to recognise that filling a prescription does not necessarily imply that the drugs are taken, we have no reason to believe that misclassification of drug use should be more prevalent in one sex. Furthermore, data on dispensed drugs are closer to the actual intake than data on prescribed drugs, and it is free from the recall bias common in patient reported data. 46 The most important limitation is the lack of information on patient characteristics and clinical data to assess the rationale behind the observed differences. Moreover, it is important to emphasise that gender differences may only be hypothesised from these data.",

We also found suggestions that gender aspects such as societal acceptance of overweight in women compared with men may be involved. More research and a greater awareness of the influence of sex and gender in health and disease are needed to ensure rational drug use in both men and women.",
