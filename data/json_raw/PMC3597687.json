            "text": "Previously, Lrp-like transcriptional regulator LysM from the hyperthermoacidophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus was proposed to have a single target, the lysWXJK operon of lysine biosynthesis, and a single effector molecule, L-lysine. Here we identify $70 novel binding sites for LysM in the S. solfataricus genome with a LysM-specific nanobody-based chromatin immunoprecipitation assay coupled to microarray hybridization (ChIPchip) and in silico target site prediction using an energy-based position weight matrix, and validate these findings with in vitro binding. LysM binds to intergenic and coding regions, including promoters of various amino acid biosynthesis and transport genes. We confirm that L-lysine is the most potent effector molecule that reduces, but does not completely abolish, LysM binding, and show that several other amino acids and derivatives, including D-lysine, L-arginine, L-homoarginine, L-glutamine and L-methionine and branched-chain amino acids L-leucine, L-isoleucine and L-valine, significantly affect DNA-binding properties of LysM. Therefore, it appears from this study that LysM is a much more versatile regulator than previously thought, and that it uses a variety of amino acids to sense nutritional quality of the environment and to modulate expression of the metabolic machinery of Sulfolobus accordingly.",

            "text": "The Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) family of transcriptional regulators is one of the largest families of bacterial/archaeal regulators (1)(2)(3). Lrp-like regulators exhibit a similar architecture (4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9). The N-terminal DNA-binding domain bears a winged helix-turn-helix motif; the C-terminal Regulation of Amino acid Metabolism (RAM) domain shows a characteristic ab sandwich fold (babbab) (5) and is involved in effectorbinding and oligomerization. Intriguingly, despite these structural similarities, bacterial and archaeal Lrp-like regulators modulate activity of two different transcription machineries. Bacterial Lrp-like regulators modulate the initiation frequency of a unique RNA polymerase that directly binds core promoter elements (10). In contrast, archaeal members regulate the activity of a eukaryotic-like transcription apparatus that consists of a TATA box, transcription factor B responsive element (BRE) and initiator (Inr); three general transcription factors [TATA binding protein (TBP), transcription factor B and transcription factor E] and a complex RNA polymerase that is most homologous to eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (11)(12)(13). As in eukarya, the unique archaeal RNA polymerase is recruited by protein-protein interactions with transcription factors. The fundamental differences between the bacterial and archaeal transcriptional machinery appeal for a different mode of action of bacterial and archaeal Lrp-like regulators, in particular concerning transcriptional activation.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli Lrp, archetype of the Lrp-like family, is a global regulator that directly or indirectly affects a plenitude of metabolic pathways (14)(15)(16) and was recently shown to use several amino acids as cofactors (17). This regulator is proposed to play an important role in coordination of the metabolic switch of microorganisms on transitions between regimes of feast and famine (18,19). In contrast, most other bacterial Lrp-like regulators act more specific, with one or a few targets only, and are generally involved in control of amino acid metabolism. Much less is known about archaeal members. Frequently, their cofactor has not yet been identified, targets apart from the control region of their own gene (autoregulation) are rarely known and molecular mechanisms of regulatory process have not been unravelled [for a review see (2)]. Nevertheless, a few case studies, in particular with regulators from model organisms Sulfolobus solfataricus (crenarchaeote) and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (euryarchaeote), indicate that archaeal Lrp-like regulators appear to be more versatile than their bacterial counterparts and that they are also involved in regulation of central metabolism (20,21).",

To avoid detection of peaks in the log 2 ratios due to reduced signal-to-noise ratios at lowintensity probes, as part of the pre-processing step, average log 2 intensities over red and green channels are calculated for each probe, and probes with resulting values smaller than the average minus twice the standard deviation are replaced by missing values. Next, a standard normalization step is performed in which Tukey's biweight mean across each sample's log 2 ratios is subtracted from individual log 2 ratios, and resulting values are averaged over replicates and smoothed over a 100-bp window to reduce stochastic noise and systematic noise due to differences in hybridization efficiency of different probes.",

The resulting chers were extended at both sides with 150 bp, and overlapping chers were then combined into one cher.

            "text": "The LysM-lysW operator interaction in S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius LysM is highly conserved among all sequenced Sulfolobus species, and their lysine biosynthesis genes are invariably organized in two consecutive operons with the same polarity, lysYZM and lysWXJK ( Figure 1A). In S. solfataricus, only the latter bears a target site for LysM (22). To analyse functional conservation of LysM and its target site(s), we performed EMSAs of LysM Ss and its orthologue LysM Sa from S. acidocaldarius binding to the lysW operator of both organisms ( Figure 1B and C). The results indicate that each regulator binds the two operators with a similar binding affinity. However, binding and migration patterns showed remarkable differences. LysM Ss formed two distinct complexes (B1 and B2) with the cognate lysW operator in a concentrationdependent manner, and some supershifted smear at the highest concentration used. In contrast, binding of LysM Ss to the heterologous lysW operator from S. acidocaldarius resulted in the formation of essentially one major complex (B1) and of a small amount of a second, slower migrating complex (B2). At the highest protein concentrations, two additional complexes (B3 and B4) were formed that exhibit an even lower relative mobility. Binding of LysM Sa to both lysW operators appeared very similar and produced essentially one major complex (B1), a tiny amount of a slower migrating complex (B2) and, at the highest protein concentrations, supershifted smear. Previously, a single high-affinity binding site for LysM Ss was identified by DNase I footprinting at low protein concentrations, whereas higher concentrations resulted in protection of a large, but undefined, zone and in the appearance of hyper-reactive bands (22). In-gel footprinting with the Cu-OP ion (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S2) demonstrated that in complex B1, LysM Ss protected a stretch of 16 and 15 nucleotides (nt) on the top and bottom strands, respectively ( Figure 2F). This zone extends from position \u00c059 to \u00c074 upstream of the initiation codon (\u00c050 to \u00c065 upstream of the transcription start site) and corresponds to the upstream binding site in Figure 2F. The slower migrating complex B2 showed two distinct zones of protection, one identical to that observed in complex B1, and an additional slightly shorter stretch of 14 nt on the top strand and of 11 nt on the bottom strand ( Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure  S2). This second zone of LysM binding (\u00c031 to \u00c044) is located slightly downstream of the major LysM binding site and covers the BRE and part of the TATA box of the lysW promoter ( Figure 2F).The centres of the principal high-affinity site and of the more degenerated accessory site are 21 bp apart; consequently, equivalent positions in both sites are aligned on the same face of the helix.",

Complex B2 did not show an additional clear zone of protection. Formation of this minor complex might therefore be due to binding of a higher oligomeric state of LysM Sa (without further contact with the DNA), to establishment of additional non-specific interactions, or to formation of 'sandwichtype' structures.",

            "text": "High-resolution contact mapping of the LysM-lysW operator interaction in S. acidocaldarius  Figure S2). Pre-methylation binding interference experiments demonstrated that methylation of three guanine residues of the top strand (G-72, G-71 and G-60) and three of the bottom strand (G-68 0 , G-57 0 and G-56 0 ) strongly reduces binding of LysM Sa (Figure 2E and F and Supplementary Figure  S2). Removal of any of these six guanine residues also strongly inhibited LysM Sa binding, except G-56 0 . As this position was not protected in the Cu-OP footprinting assay, we may conclude that G-56 0 is not directly contacted and that the negative effect of pre-methylation of this base most likely results from steric hindrance exerted by the methyl group on contact of LysM Sa with an adjacent base-specific or backbone group. These results confirm recognition of a semi-palindromic sequence centred around position \u00c064, which is highly conserved between S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius (22) ( Figure 2F). The binding site overlaps part of the lysM ORF and its translational stop codon. Furthermore, it is located 11 bp upstream of the predicted lysW BRE and TATA box. Dimethyl sulphate methylates guanine residues at position N 7 in the major groove. Therefore, we may conclude that LysM interacts specifically with two consecutive major groove segments and intervening minor groove of the operator, all aligned on one face of the DNA helix ( Figure 2F). It is interesting to note that in this helical orientation, TBP and LysM are expected to bind to the same face of the DNA.  Figure S2.",

            "text": "To determine the sequence specificity of LysM binding, EMSAs with LysM Sa binding to a set of 22 mutated variants (all possible single-bp substitutions at all positions of one half-site) were performed ( Figure 4A), and relative K A s were calculated ( Supplementary Table S2). Due to full symmetry of the consensus site, only one substitution was analysed at position 0. This analysis resulted in a quantitative model of binding specificity, representing a significant part of the complete binding energy landscape. This model is graphically represented by an energy-normalized sequence logo ( Figure 4B). The total information content of the LysM binding specificity is 8.46, and therefore, LysM binds DNA with a relative high sequence specificity. This specificity is restricted to the half sites, particularly to positions \u00c03 and \u00c04, which are highly discriminative for a G-C and a C-G bp, respectively. The remainder of the sequence specificity in major groove recognition is largely contributed by position \u00c07, displaying a preference for a G-C bp. As information content of individual positions is higher in half sites than in the central region, our analysis confirms recognition of two major groove segments and the intervening minor groove ( Figure 4B). These results of the high-resolution contact mapping of the lysW operator are fully compatible with these data ( Figure 2F). Unexpectedly, there is no pronounced preference for weak bps at central positions. Generally, the contribution of the minor groove-recognized part of a site to sequence preference is low and mostly arising from a preference for A-T or T-A bps, which facilitate minor groove compression. Most likely, this situation reflects the relative modest LysM-induced DNA bending. This is further confirmed by the observation that LysM Sa binds mutant operators bearing an I-C at positions \u00c01 and+1 with only a 1.3-fold higher affinity than mutant operators with G-C substitutions at both positions (Supplementary Figure S3). Inosine is identical to guanine in the major groove but lacks the exocyclic amino group that causes a steric hindrance for minor groove compression.",

Significant binding was also detected at the lysYZM promoter region (Supplementary Figure S4), which was previously shown not to be bound by LysM in vitro. This observation necessitates revision of the statement that LysM Ss is not involved in autoregulation and in regulation of lysY and lysZ (22). However, it remains unclear whether LysM Ss is associated at the lysY promoter because of direct recognition of a binding motif, or rather indirectly through proteinprotein interactions (see later in the text).",

            "text": "Positions of predicted motifs located in intergenic regions with respect to the closest translational start varied significantly, but many are located between 40 and 70 bp upstream of an initiation codon (Supplementary Dataset S1). There are also several cases in which, as for the lysW operator, the predicted motif is located at the 3 0 -end of an ORF and close to the promoter of a downstream gene or operon (see later, Figure 6A and F). Transcription units, of which expression is potentially influenced by LysM Ss , encode proteins with various functions, which can be classified in following categories: amino acid metabolism, central metabolism, transport, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) immunity system, translation and hypothetical proteins For a distribution over the different functional categories, see Figure 5 and Supplementary Dataset S1. Curiously, LysM Ss is associated with several tRNA genes and CRISPR loci. Furthermore, of particular interest are potential target genes that function in biosynthesis and transport of amino acids other than lysine, some of which are studied in more detail later in the text.  In vitro DNA-binding affinity of LysM Ss for the lysW operator decreases on addition of lysine (22). However, the in vivo LysM Ss DNA-binding profiles appeared similar in either presence or absence of L-lysine ( Figure 5).Based on the main criteria used for peak calling, namely, that peaks exceed a log 2 value of 2.0 in both biological duplicates, not all peaks were called in both growth conditions. Nevertheless, for all peaks called in one condition, signals exceeded a log 2 threshold of 1.0 in the other condition, indicating that there is no significant difference in binding profile in cells grown with and without exogenous lysine (Supplementary Dataset S1). However, it should be taken into account that ChIP-chip profiles do not provide a quantitative measure of DNA binding, as demonstrated for lysW: whereas ChIP profiles in both conditions appear similar (Supplementary Figure S4), qPCR quantification, which is more accurate because of a higher dynamic range, demonstrates a difference in enrichment of >4-fold (Supplementary Figure S5). Consequently, despite the observation that ChIP binding profiles are similar on growth in presence and absence of lysine, DNA-binding characteristics such as affinity or stoichiometry might nevertheless be different.",

Here we identify 73 binding sites for LysM and demonstrate that LysM is a much more versatile regulator than originally thought. Binding sites for LysM may occur singly or in combination with an auxiliary more degenerated LysM box, as demonstrated for lysW and Sso2043. LysM is not only involved in transcriptional control of lysine biosynthesis, but it also modulates expression of genes involved in biosynthesis of leucine and glutamate and of genes annotated as amino acid transport-related. Clearly, the control of amino acid metabolism and transport is a primary task of LysM, although the transcription factor also binds in the neighbourhood of promoters expressing genes with a variety of other functions.",

In vitro DNA binding was invariably reduced in the presence of lysine and in vivo, a significant downregulation was observed on lysine supplementation for all four tested targets (lysX, gltB, leuA-2 and Sso1906). We can assume that this regulatory response originates at least partially from LysM action, and it is strongly suggested that LysM functions as an activator. Although FL11 from Pyrococcus sp. OT3 and LysM have similar cofactor specificity with lysine as the major coregulator, their mode of action is clearly different. Whereas FL11 generally works as a repressor of which the activity is relieved in presence of lysine (9), LysM appears to act as a transcriptional activator in absence of lysine. For lysW, leuA-2, Sso1906 and Sso2043, the main LysM binding site is located just upstream of predicted BRE and TATA box elements ( Figure 7E). This is reminiscent of activation by Ptr2, an Lrp-like transcription factor from M. jannaschii that binds at an equivalent relative position and activates transcription by stimulating protein-protein interactions with TBP (20). In the cases of Sso2043 and lysW, binding of LysM at a secondary accessory binding site located either upstream or downstream of the core binding site ( Figures 2F and 7E) might contribute to more profound regulatory effects: either further activation or a switch to repression. In contrast, the distance between the main LysM binding site and the translational initiation site in the gltB promoter region suggests that the regulator is positioned in between the promoter region and initiation site.",

The preference for the most potent effector molecules, that is lysine > arginine > glutamine, is identical as for FL11, and the structural basis for this similarity lies in conservation of a glutamine at position 97 and an aspartate at position  121. Side-chain oxygen molecules of these residues form hydrogen bonds with the lysine side chain, thereby determining ligand specificity (45). An arginine-FL11 cocrystal structure demonstrates that arginine is less efficient because of the longer side chain causing conformational changes in the protein (45), and we can assume that a similar situation occurs in LysM. The stronger effect of homoarginine observed for LysM can be explained by its larger structural similarity to lysine (4 CH 2 -groups preceding an N-atom that may engage in H-bonding) ( Figure 9E). Competitive binding of different amino acids, each with a different affinity, will allow an adapted regulatory response to the nutritional state of the cell. This state is reflected by concentration ratios of different amino acids rather than by the absolute concentration of a single amino acid type. Furthermore, a broad cofactor specificity is also rationalized by the observation that LysM regulates not only lysine biosynthesis but also biosynthesis and transport of other amino acids.",

            "text": "All LysM Ss targets were bound in vivo in growth conditions with and without lysine supplementation, whereas enrichments quantified by qPCR, in vitro binding affinity of LysM and promoter activities were invariably lower in the presence of lysine. This indicates that ChIP-chip is not a valid quantitative measure of target site occupancy and likely reflects the observation that lysine reduces, but does not completely abolish, binding of LysM, an observation that was made with all six tested intergenic and intragenic binding sites (lysW, gltB, leuA-2, Sso1906, Sso2043 and Sso2497, Figure 9 and data not shown). It is also reminiscent of the effect of L-leucine on DNA-binding capacity of E. coli Lrp (46,47), although in this case, ChIP-chip DNA-binding profiles were clearly sensitive to the presence of exogenous leucine (16). The mechanisms underlying the negative effect of ligand binding on DNA-binding affinity of LysM are not yet understood. In some instances, such as for E. coli Lrp and the archaeal FL11, cofactor binding influences the association state of the Lrp-like protein, thereby shifting the equilibrium between different oligomeric forms that each have different DNA-binding characteristics (45,48). However, this is not a general rule and ligand binding might also induce more subtle conformational changes (6,8). Preliminary data indicate that this is the case for LysM, as lysine does not affect the tetrameric state of the regulator in solution (22). Possibly, effector binding reduces the DNA-binding capacity of LysM by re-orienting two helix-turn-helix motifs with respect to successive major groove segments of the operator. Besides diminishing DNA-binding affinity, this re-orientation could equally modify the position of the C-terminal surface responsible for transcription regulation with respect to elements of the basal transcription apparatus, thereby affecting regulatory outcome.",

This situation might occur at targets that are efficiently bound in vivo but not in vitro, as demonstrated for Sso2824 and Sso2334-2336. Such differential binding is generally ascribed to involvement of co-regulators, other transcription factors or nucleoid-associated proteins, which may enhance binding affinity and/or stability at sites with a low intrinsic affinity for the regulator. In a proteome-wide study of protein-protein interactions in Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3, hetero-interactions have been identified for two Lrp-like proteins (49). Additionally, FL9 and DM1 from Pyrococcus OT3, a full-length and truncated Lrp protein, respectively, have been shown to form hetero-octamers (44). Possibly, LysM is capable of establishing such hetero-oligomeric interactions, thereby largely expanding its regulatory power, both with respect to effector response as to target gene repertoire. Whether LysM exerts autoregulation is not entirely clear. In vivo, LysM associates with the lysYZM promoter region, but we did not detect binding in vitro, and northern blotting indicated that production of lysY and lysM mRNA was not affected on addition of lysine (22).",

Eleven of these are predicted to harbour a high-affinity bona fide LysM-binding motif (theoretical K D < 50 nM). Such a high frequency of intragenic binding sites is unusual for bacterial transcriptional regulators (16,(50)(51)(52), with E. coli RutR as an exception (53). For archaeal transcription factor TrmB of Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1, 40% of binding sites are located inside coding sequences (54). Possibly, intragenic binding is more common for archaeal than for bacterial transcription factors, given their more compact genome organizations and smaller average intergenic region lengths (55). Indeed, some LysM Ss targets, for example the lysW and Sso0572 operators, appear to be true promoter-associated regulatory sites while located in the 3 0 -end of the preceding ORF sequence. Other intragenic sites might also have regulatory functions for as yet undetected transcription units, given the flexible transcriptome architecture of S. solfataricus with a high abundance of conditionally active initiation and termination sites inside operons and of small RNAs (56,57). Alternatively, these binding sites do not function in direct transcription regulation but serve to control the intracellular concentration of free regulatory protein, or they merely occur by chance without any Figure 9.

The Sso1906 gene cluster is flanked by a transposase, suggesting that gene duplication was mediated by a transposition event (58). The intergenic regions are highly conserved without a selective pressure for conservation of the LysM-binding motifs (data not shown). In vitro, LysM Ss binds with a significantly higher affinity to the promoter region of the ancestral Sso2043, which contains a binding motif corresponding perfectly to the consensus sequence, than to the Sso1906 promoter, in which two mismatches have originated at specificity-determining positions ( Figure 6 and Table 1). Moreover, the accessory binding site identified in the Sso2043 control region is lost in the Sso1906 control region. Therefore, although our ChIP-chip data indicate that this LysM Ss regulatory interaction has been inherited after the gene duplication event, differences in binding affinity might lead to differential regulation. As a consequence, the duplicated genes might respond slightly different to metabolic needs, thereby placing a selection pressure on maintenance of the duplicated gene cluster and on further degeneration and possibly even on the future loss of the LysM Ss -binding motif in the Sso1906 promoter region. Our analysis has provided a 'snapshot' of the evolutionary expansion of the LysM Ss regulon.",
