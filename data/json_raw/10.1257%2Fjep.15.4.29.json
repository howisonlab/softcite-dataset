When the data are censored, variation in the observed dependent variable will understate the effect of the regressors on the \"true\" dependent variable. As a result, standard ordinary least squares regression using censored data will typically result in coefficient estimates that are biased toward zero. Traditional statistical analysis uses maximum likelihood or related procedures to deal with the problem of censored data. However, the validity of such methods requires correct specification of the error distribution, which can be problematic in practice. In the past two decades, a number of semiparametric alternatives for dealing with censored data have been proposed. In a semiparametric approach, part of the functional form of the model-usually the regression function-is parametrically specified by the researcher based upon plausible assumptions, while the rest of the model is not parameterized. 1 While the theoretical literature has produced several semiparametric estimators for the censored data model, published applications of these estimators to empirical problems in economics have lagged far behind. This paper reviews the intuition and computation of a handful of semiparametric estimators proposed for the censored regression model. The various estimators are used to examine changes in black-white earnings inequality during the 1 In this issue, the paper by DiNardo and Tobias offers further discussion of nonparametric and semiparametric analysis.",

These earnings records are censored at the taxable maximum; that is, anyone earning more than the maximum that was taxable under Social Security is recorded as having earned at the maximum. Thus, above the maximum, the data on earnings do not accurately reflect actual earnings. Ordinary least squares analysis of these data implies little convergence in the earnings of black and white workers during the 1960s. On the other hand, the estimates from the semiparametric models that account for censoring suggest that significant black-white earnings convergence did occur after 1964. Comparisons of the results from parametric and semiparametric procedures help pinpoint sources of misspecification in the parametric approach.",

Otherwise, the closest endpoint of the interval is observed instead of y*. Tobin (1958) used this model to analyze consumer expenditures on automobiles, with a \u03ed 0 and b \u03ed \u03f1, and economists generally refer to regression models with nonnegativity constraints as Tobit models. Other typical applications of these censored regression models are to right-censored data, where a \u03ed \u03ea\u03f1 and b represents a maximum recordable value for the dependent variable. Such models arise for top-coded data, where sufficiently large values of the true variable y* are recorded as \"at least equal to b.\" In our primary empirical application, the dependent variable, the logarithm of annual earnings, is \"top-coded,\" or censored from above, with b equal to the logarithm of the maximum annual earnings subject to Social Security taxes in a given year. Algebraically, the model for the observed dependent variable y under interval censoring is y \u03ed \u036d a if x\u0408\u2424 \u03e9 \u03fd a, b",

However, if the regression function x\u0408\u2424 is below the lower threshold a (or above the upper threshold b), then more than 50 percent of the distribution will \"pile up\" at a (or b). In this case, the median of y is that interval endpoint, which does not depend on x\u0408\u2424. Thus, computation of the CLAD estimator alternates between deleting observations with estimates of the regression function x\u0408\u2424 that are outside the uncensored region [a, b] (the \"recensoring\" step) and estimating the regression coefficients by applying least absolute deviations to the remaining observations (the \"regression\" step), as described by Buchinsky (1994). 2 The symmetrically censored least squares (SCLS) estimation method, proposed by Powell (1986b), is based on a \"symmetric trimming\" idea. For simplicity, suppose that a \u03ed \u03ea\u03f1, so that the data are \"top-coded\" at b (as in our empirical application), and assume that the true dependent variable y* is symmetrically distributed around the regression function x\u0408\u2424. Due to the censoring, the observed dependent variable y has an asymmetric distribution, since its upper tail is \"piled up\" at the censoring point b. This situation is illustrated in Figure 1. However, symmetry can be restored by \"symmetrically censoring\" the dependent variable y from below at the point 2x\u0408\u2424 \u03ea b. Now the regression function is equidistant from both censoring points. Since this new \"recensored\" dependent variable is symmetrically distributed around the regression function, the regression coefficients can be estimated by least squares. Iterating between this \"symmetric censoring\" of the dependent variable using the current estimates (which drops observations with values of the regression function above b) and least squares estimation of the regression coefficients using the \"symmetrically trimmed\" data yields the SCLS estimator.",

The SCLS estimator is based on the assumption that the error terms are symmetrically distributed around zero, which implies that their median (and mean) is zero. While compatible with the traditional assumption of normally distributed and homoskedastic errors, the symmetry assumption is less restrictive and provides consistent estimates when these parametric conditions fail to hold. However, it is stronger than the \"zero median\" restriction exploited by the CLAD estimator, which permits nonnormal, heteroskedastic and asymmetric errors. The ICLAD and ICLS estimators assume that the error terms are identically (but not necessarily symmetrically) distributed, ruling out heteroskedasticity, but permitting asymmetry of the error distribution. 4 As with the choice of regressors, it is ultimately up to the empirical researcher to determine which assumption is most plausible for the particular application. In practice, though, computation of several parametric and semiparametric estimators provides a useful guide to the sensitivity of the results to the identifying assumptions, either through casual comparison of the coefficient estimates and standard errors or more formal specification tests of the kind described by Newey (1987).

            "text": "We use several approaches to estimate the interval censoring model. The dependent variable in each case is the natural logarithm of annual taxable earnings, and the explanatory variables are race, level of education, age and agesquared. Table 1 presents the estimation results for the race and education coefficients based on the various estimators. The first column, headed OLS1, contains the ordinary least squares estimates based on all of the data. The second column, headed OLS2, presents the least squares results using only the observations that are not censored. The third column contains the Tobit maximum likelihood estimates under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed and homoskedastic. The remaining columns present the results for the three semiparametric estimators: CLAD, SCLS and ICLAD. The Tobit, CLAD and SCLS estimators were implemented using the Stata software package, while the ICLAD estimator was calculated using the Gauss package. For each estimator, we have created Stata \"ado\" files that are available at \u0357http://elsa.berkeley.edu/\u03f3kenchay\u0358. 8 It is clear from Table 1 that the least squares and maximum likelihood estimates of the black-white log-earnings gap and the returns to education are extremely biased when compared to the semiparametric estimators. We think of the CLAD estimator as the natural benchmark, since it is consistent under the normality of errors assumption justifying the maximum likelihood estimator, under the independence of errors assumption justifying the ICLAD estimator, and under the conditional symmetry of errors assumption justifying the SCLS estimator. When compared to the CLAD benchmark, the least squares estimator based on all of the data (OLS1) actually does better than the maximum likelihood estimator. For this application, it appears that misspecifying the errors as being normally distributed and using maximum likelihood estimation results in more biased estimates than ignoring the censoring problem entirely and using least squares estimation. A more formal test of the normality assumption also suggests that it is violated for the log-earnings model. 9 There are sizeable differences in the estimated effects of education on earnings across the three semiparametric estimators. While the ICLAD and SCLS estimators of the education premium are similar, they are always greater than the CLAD estimator. These differences are significant given the precision of the estimates and range from 17 percent to 43 percent for the ICLAD estimator and 9 Chay and Honor\u00e9 (1998) calculate the test statistics for nonnormality and for heteroskedasticity in censored regression models discussed by Chesher and Irish (1987). The test statistic for detecting nonnormality ranges from 900.47 to 1200.68. Under the null, this statistic has an (asymptotic) 2 (2) distribution with a 1 percent critical value of 9.21. Therefore, we easily reject the hypothesis that the errors are normally distributed. The test for heteroskedasticity yields statistics between 84.71 and 90.85. Under the null, these have (asymptotic) 2 (12) distributions with a 1 percent critical value of 26.22. We therefore also reject the null of no heteroskedasticity. 20 percent to 33 percent for the SCLS estimator. The differences in the estimates of the black-white earnings gap are smaller, with the CLAD estimator about 11 percent to 28 percent and 4 percent to 18 percent smaller in magnitude than the ICLAD and SCLS estimators, respectively. Strikingly, the semiparametric approaches all result in more precise estimates of the race coefficient than maximum likelihood estimation. For example, the standard errors of the CLAD estimator are 25 percent to 55 percent smaller than the standard errors of the Tobit estimator. 10 The differences in the coefficient estimates across the various estimators can be used as a sort of specification check, similar in spirit to the Newey (1987) specification analysis mentioned earlier. For the education coefficient, the large differences between the maximum likelihood and semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormal errors are an important source of bias in the Tobit estimator. Further, the significant differences among the semiparametric estimates imply that heteroskedasticity and asymmetry of the errors are also sources of misspecification in the maximum likelihood estimator of the education premium. Conversely, for the black-white earnings gap, the smaller differences among the semiparametric estimates suggest that nonnormality is the biggest source of bias in the Tobit estimator, with heteroskedasticity and asymmetry playing smaller roles.",

The resulting estimated error distribution for logearnings has fatter tails than does a normal distribution. The maximum likelihood estimator is sensitive to values in the tails, while the least absolute deviations estimator, which focuses on the median value, is unaffected by extreme observations. Since black men are more likely to be in the left-hand tail of the distribution, fat tails can explain the consistently larger (in magnitude) maximum likelihood estimates of the race coefficient. They can also explain the larger sampling errors of the Tobit estimator relative to the semiparametric estimators. Thus, abnormally long tails in the log-earnings distribution may be the major source of misspecification in the maximum likelihood estimates of the black-white earnings gap (Chay, 1995;Chay and Honor\u00e9, 1998).",

The maximum likelihood and semiparametric estimates all imply that the black-white earnings gap narrowed about 0.15 log points from 1963-1964 to 1970 -1971. We conclude from this that while there is bias in the Tobit estimator of the race coefficient, this bias is fixed over time. Thus, it is \"differenced out\" when one examines changes in the estimated race coefficient. However, the two ordinary least squares estimators imply that relative earnings only converged between 0.06 (OLS2) and 0.10 (OLS1) log points during the period of interest. Not accounting for the severe censoring in the earnings data results in downwardly biased estimates of the impact of Title VII.

The bottom panel plots the estimated black-white log-earnings gaps from the OLS1, OLS2, MLE and CLAD estimators for the series of cross-sections from 1958 -1974. There is a striking correspondence between changes in the top-code rate in the top panel and changes in the ordinary least squares estimates in the bottom panel. Indeed, it seems that most of the changes in the ordinary least squares estimates over time are being driven by changes in the amount of censoring varying by race. This results in a severe understatement of the racial earnings convergence in the late 1960s. The time series of the CLAD and maximum likelihood estimates, on the other hand, have no association with the top-code rates, although, as noted earlier, the maximum likelihood estimates systematically overstate the size of the blackwhite earnings gap when compared to the CLAD estimates.

The relative earnings of black men increased about 0.12-0.14 log-points from 1963 to 1971. These estimates are similar to those implied by the series of maximum likelihood and semiparametric estimates of the cross-sectional censored regression model in Table 1. A key assumption underlying the fixed-effects ICLAD estimator is that the distribution of the unobservables is the same in all time periods for a given individual. A formal specification test did not reject the restrictions implied by this assumption at conventional levels of significance (Chay and Honor\u00e9, 1998). Notes: See notes to Table 1. The sample is the 7,435 men with positive earnings in all four years. For each pair of years, the absolute error loss function was used to estimate the identically censored panel data model with fixed effects. The estimates represent the change in the coefficients between the two years.",

The results from the semiparametric models show that there was significant earnings convergence among black and white men in the American South after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a result that was masked by least squares analysis. The semiparametric methods can also provide information on the sources of misspecification in parametric estimation approaches. In the logearnings model, it appears that abnormally long tails are the major source of bias in the Tobit maximum likelihood estimates.",
