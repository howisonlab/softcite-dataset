This study aimed to examine the trends of overweight and obesity among childhood in China and assess their associations with family income, dietary intake, and physical activity (PA) between 1997 and 2009. Methods: Two waves of cross-sectional data of Chinese children and adolescents aged 7-17 years from the China Health and Nutrition Survey were used. Weight and height were measured following standardized procedures. Dietary intake was assessed by 3 consecutive 24-h recalls. Childhood overweight and obesity were defined using the International Obesity Task Force-recommended body mass index cutoffs. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations of family income with diet intakes and PA. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the associations of overweight and obesity with family income, dietary intake, and PA. Results: The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity increased from 12.6% in 1997 to 22.1% in 2009, particularly in the medium-and high-family income groups, which increased by 102.7% and 90.3%, respectively. Higher fat intake (% energy), and moderate and vigorous PA were significantly associated with overweight and obesity in final model (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.02, P = 0.004; and OR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-1.00, P = 0.036, respectively). Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese children and adolescents has increased between 1997 and 2009. Reducing fat intake and increasing PA may help obesity prevention.",

[1,2] Childhood obesity could induce adverse health and social consequences, such as adult obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. [3] Cumulative researches from developed countries have shown a significantly negative association between household income level and prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents, but the results were inconsistent with those in developing nations. [4,5] In 27 of 37 developing countries, higher socioeconomic status was associated with higher gains in overweight and obesity prevalence; in the remaining 10 countries, lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher gains in overweight and obesity prevalence. [6] The income is associated with altered dietary intakes and levels of physical activity (PA), as a result of which the incidence of obesity may be affected. [7] The evidence linking dietary intakes and PA with obesity among children and adolescents is inconclusive and contradictory. [8][9][10] Energy intakes in children and adolescents have shown a small or no association with weight status in previous epidemiologic studies, partly because of a possibly underreported dietary intake. [11,12] Several studies on overweight and obesity among children and adolescents indicate a significant association between weight status and PA. [13] To date, most studies focused on either PA or dietary intakes, and few took both into account. The relationships of overweight and obesity with PA and dietary intakes in children and adolescents have seldom been examined by combining household income using a large sample size, nor",

China, where economic reforms were initiated in the late 1970s, has become the largest developing nation and the second largest economy globally and is undergoing nutrition and lifestyle transitions characterized by ample food supply and higher living standards, as described elsewhere. [14] To our knowledge, there are few epidemiological studies exploring the status of overweight and obesity in Chinese children and adolescents along with their dietary intakes and PA, setting these data against the background of widespread nutritional and lifestyle transitions. To mitigate the potentially harmful effects and to optimize the potential benefits of this transition, it is important to address this issue, taking care to delineate any differences from western developed countries.",

Details of the study design have been described elsewhere. [15,16] The present study was based on two cross-sectional samples collected in 1997 and 2009 of the CHNS. Because the sedentary time of children and adolescents was not collected in 1989, 1991, and 1993, we chose 1997 as the reference. Of the total 3391 children and adolescents aged 7-17 years who attended school, 3221 (95%) subjects (2275 in 1997 and 946 in 2009) had complete and reasonable measurements of weight and height. The 155 subjects were excluded because of missing data, including household income (n = 53), anthropometric measurements (n = 25), or PA (n = 77). Another 15 subjects were excluded because of extreme body mass index (BMI) (z-scores >5 or <\u22125) or impossible time spent in PA (e.g., 25 h/day). It is worthy to address that there was much smaller sample size in 2009 compared to that in 1997, which resulted from migration of new established households with newborns and/or children during 1997-2009 into other communities, out of targeted communities; lower birth rate from 1997 (16.57%) to 2009 (11.95%); [17] and lost to follow-up some teenagers during survey period as attending boarding school.",

The increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents was consistent with that in other countries, [24,25] and was accompanied by a concurrent increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese adults. [26] An overall increasing trend toward obesity had been found in the study of childhood obesity from the US and Brazil, which was dramatically similar to our results. [24,25] In addition, our results showed that overweight and obesity of children and  adolescents in China increased as income has increased; in contrast, only children and adolescents from low-or high-income groups had a higher prevalence of obesity in other countries. [24,25] A striking association of household income with dietary intakes and PA in our study was consistent with the findings from other studies, which have found differences in nutrient intakes by income. [7,27] We found more energy intake, higher fat intake, and more MET-hours/week spent in sedentary activity in the higher-income group, and that high-income group also had a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity, which was similar to findings from Brazil. [25] Traditionally, research into weight status and its influencing factors has only focused on a single behavior. However, obesity development in childhood and adolescence is associated with a complex behavioral pattern of energy intake and energy expenditure. Evidence about the association of overweight and obesity with multiple variables such as income, diet, and PA is still scarce. This is one of the first studies from Asia to specifically test the effects of the combination of income, diet, and activity on overweight and obesity among Chinese children and adolescents. Our results were consistent with a recent study conducted in American children and adolescents that examined diet and PA as risk factors for overweight and obesity. [28] However, some issues need to be clarified by additional studies. We found that only MET-hours/week spent in moderate and vigorous PA and energy derived from fat appeared to have independent associations with overweight and obesity for Chinese children and adolescents, which is novel and gives interesting implications for research and intervention.",

In addition, our results, including the inverse effect of moderate and vigorous PA, were consistent with other studies summarized in a recent literature review showing a negative relationship between moderate and vigorous activity and risk of obesity. [8] Although conclusions supporting an association between sedentary behavior and obesity have not been found, our results have indicated that MET-hours/week spent in sedentary activity had a marked increase. Strong national economic drivers increased the opportunities of Chinese children and adolescents for access to screen-based devices such as computers and video games, and in the unique Chinese cultural setting, most children and adolescents had more extracurricular academic activities such as homework  and night classes, all of which may contribute to rising sedentary activity time. Adopting measures to increase PA for Chinese children and adolescents at school as well as control sedentary activity time are critical and noticeable.",

Third, the collection methods of PA and dietary data in children and adolescents varied slightly by age groups, with assistance from caregivers for children <10 years.

These findings suggest that household income, dietary intake, and PA have changed dramatically over time, and prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased. Sedentary behaviors are more common while moderate and vigorous PA is inadequate. Lower fat intake and frequent participation in moderate and vigorous PA may be protective against overweight and obesity. ",
