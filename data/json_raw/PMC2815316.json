Children these days have easy access to the internet. Thus, a web-based nutrition education program for children is an effective tool for nutrition education of children. This site provides the material of the nutrition education for children with characters which are personified nutrients. The 151 menus are stored in the site together with video script of the cooking process. The menus are classified by the criteria based on age, menu type and the ethnic origin of the menu. The site provides a search function. There are three kinds of search conditions which are key words, menu type and \"between\" expression of nutrients such as calorie and other nutrients. The site is developed with the operating system Windows 2003 Server, the web server ZEUS 5, development language JSP, and database management system Oracle 10 g.",

The most common nutrition-related problems among children include under-nutrition, iron-deficiency anemia, dental caries, high blood lipid profile, overweight and obesity (Boyle, 2003). In 2003, the Korea president announced the First Year of Children's Safety. Since then, the government has promoted various polices in order to enhance children's health. However, they appear to lack a comprehensive vision or systematic development of action plans. The eating habits which developed in childhood greatly affect one's lifelong habits and health. Besides, the education to provide information on food safety and nutrition has not been adequate. Improper dietary habits and unhealthy life styles may have resulted in a radical increase in producing number of overweight and obese children and teenagers. The Korea National Health & Nutrition Survey 2005 revealed that over the past seven years, there has been a significant 1.5-fold increase in the number of overweight boys and girls under 18 years of age. And dietary intakes of children were deficient in calcium and potassium. In contrast, the intakes of protein and sodium were becoming excessive (Department of Health and Welfare & Korea Health Industry Development Institute, 2006).",

            "text": "Nutrition education for children is valuable in changing dietary behaviors and promoting health, considering that good eating behavior formed in childhood would continue to later life. Some off-line programs on menu planning and nutrition analysis have been developed and used (Han, 1997;Hong, 1989;Hong, 1996;Joni, 1983;Kang et al., 1999;Kolasa & Miller, 1996). The use of internet has become popular in Korea. Those who use internet reached 75% in 2006; of those aged 6-19 years, 98.5% used the internet (National Internet Development Agency of Korea & Ministry of Information Communication Republic of Korea, 2007). So, needs for web-based contents have been rapidly increasing in educational fields. \"Diet and meal management\" of lecture contents and software system for web-based nutritional assessment and counseling (Youn, 2001) were researched. The Korean Society of Community Nutrition, Nutrition Education Center of Ulsan University, The Korean Food & Nutrition Society and KFDA are running internet-based nutrition education programs. Some web-based programs for nutrition were developed (Han, 2000;Han & Jeong, 2004;Her & Lee, 2002;   & Lee, 2003a;Her & Lee, 2003b;Hong & Kim, 2005;Kim & Yoon, 1999;Lee et al., 2002) and also a food exchange program (Hong et al., 2004). But it is limited to adults and not easy for an inexperienced person. Those of the program have to be developed for wider groups of people. Needs for nutrition education of children are increasing and related resources are essential (Park et al., 2006;Shin et al., 2006). Internet could be a useful route for children to provide nutrition information and educational messages. Many kinds of topics or methods might be effectively applied, in designing and planning nutrition web-sites or planning education programs, for example cooking or selecting snacks, flash animation with nutrition messages. Nutrition web-sites for children should be constructed in a way that children find the sites easily and search the contents for fun . So, we tried to make kid-friendly web-based nutrition education searching system for healthy menu recipe and easily learned nutrition information with a lot of searching methods.",

So we have to provide easier and a variety of menus having more nutritious ingredients for the kids. This kind of effort was organized for kid's easy access and attribute motive to learn about food and nutrition. It will give better motive for education needs of kids (Park et al., 2006;Shin et al., 2006). These kinds of trials can be helpful for a future disease preventing program and it could give knowledgeable information to the kids. We hope that these kinds of web-based systems could be widely used for nutrition education for kids and adults.",
