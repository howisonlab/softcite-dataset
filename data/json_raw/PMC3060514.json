            "text": "Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2; GPR43) is a G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptor for short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that is implicated in inflammatory and metabolic disorders. The SCFA propionate has close to optimal ligand efficiency for FFA2 and can hence be considered as highly potent given its size. Propionate, however, does not discriminate between FFA2 and the closely related receptor FFA3 (GPR41). To identify FFA2-selective ligands and understand the molecular basis for FFA2 selectivity, a targeted library of small carboxylic acids was examined using holistic, label-free dynamic mass redistribution technology for primary screening and the receptor-proximal G protein [ 35 S]guanosine 5-(3-O-thio)triphosphate activation, inositol phosphate, and cAMP accumulation assays for hit confirmation. Structure-activity relationship analysis allowed formulation of a general rule to predict selectivity for small carboxylic acids at the orthosteric binding site where ligands with substituted sp 3-hybridized \u2423-carbons preferentially activate FFA3, whereas ligands with sp 2-or sp-hybridized \u2423-carbons prefer FFA2. The orthosteric binding mode was verified by site-directed mutagenesis: replacement of orthosteric site arginine residues by alanine in FFA2 prevented ligand binding, and molecular modeling predicted the detailed mode of binding. Based on this, selective mutation of three residues to their non-conserved counterparts in FFA3 was sufficient to transfer FFA3 selectivity to FFA2. Thus, selective activation of FFA2 via the orthosteric site is achievable with rather small ligands, a finding with significant implications for the rational design of therapeutic compounds selectively targeting the SCFA receptors.",

            "text": "The seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor FFA2, 6 previously named GPR43, is expressed primarily on neutrophils, eosinophils, and other immune cells and responds to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (1), which are produced in high concentrations by microbial fermentation in the colon (2). The receptor plays a critical role in neutrophil recruitment during intestinal inflammation (3), and FFA2-deficient mice show exacerbated or unresolved inflammation in colitis, arthritis, and asthma models, indicating that FFA2 can provide a molecular link between fermentable dietary fiber and its beneficial effects on colitis and inflammation (4). These studies suggest that FFA2 is important in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and that the receptor might represent a new drug target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The receptor is also believed to play a role in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation (5). Further studies, however, are necessary to firmly establish these novel links, and such studies will depend critically on the availability of selective agonists and antagonists for the receptor.",

            "text": "FFA2 and the closely related receptor FFA3 (GPR41) respond to SCFAs at high micromolar and millimolar concentrations with propionate being the most potent agonist for both receptors (6 -8). Together with the medium-and long-chain free fatty acid receptor FFA1 (GPR40), the receptors form a subfamily capable of sensing free fatty acids in concentrations corresponding to elevated physiological levels (1,9). Although the molar potency of the SCFAs on FFA2 and FFA3 must be regarded as low, the compounds are also very small. Ligand efficiency (LE) is a recently introduced concept that assists lead selection by calculating binding energy per non-hydrogen atom as smaller, potent leads increase the likelihood of generating drug candidates with appropriate pharmacokinetic characteristics (10,11). LE has become popular in evaluation of early leads and is especially widespread in fragment-based drug discovery where such small ligands are grown or assembled to larger and more potent leads (12,13). Analysis of successful drugs has suggested that an LE of \u232cg \u03fd \u03ea0.3 kcal mol \u03ea1 per non-hydrogen atom is desirable, and empirical analysis has concluded that the maximal free energy contribution per heavy atom for non-metal ligands is around \u03ea1.5 kcal mol \u03ea1 per nonhydrogen atom (14). Notably, acetate (C2) and propionate (C3) already have ligand efficiencies close to this value at FFA2 and FFA3 and can therefore be regarded as highly potent for their size (Table 1). Thus, it is unrealistic to expect that the potency of the SCFAs can be increased without at the same time considerably increasing the size of the compounds. It is unclear, however, whether the orthosteric binding site can accommodate significantly larger ligands. A detailed understanding of the interactions of the SCFAs in the orthosteric binding site is expected to indicate the prospects for this strategy and to assist the rational design of larger, more potent and selective modulators of FFA2 and FFA3.",

A series of FFA2-selective allosteric agonists that exhibit positive cooperativity with SCFAs has also been disclosed (16,17). Although these compounds certainly represent useful tools for further pharmacological studies of FFA2, because they bind to a site or sites distinct from the orthosteric binding pocket, it is possible that they may generate signals that are not identical to those triggered by SCFAs. The moderate solubility and metabolic liability of these allosteric compounds furthermore represent a limitation to their use (17). In the present study, we explored the potential of small carboxylic acids (SCAs) as pharmacological tools and further investigated their interaction with the orthosteric binding site. To date, only a small number of saturated straight and branched SCAs have been investigated as ligands at these receptors. Here we report the results from structure-activity investigations of an expanded set of SCAs, including carboxylic acids with additional branched, unsaturated, and cyclic tails. The studies led to the identification of selective orthosteric ligands for both FFA2 and FFA3 and to the elucidation of a general rule to predict the FFA2/FFA3 selectivity of SCAs. Furthermore, this rule was validated by molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis at FFA2, resulting in the reversal of selectivity between FFA2 and FFA3 ligands at the mutated receptor.",

Selection of homology models was based on the location of extracellular loop 2 (ECL2). Only models where ECL2 was located relatively similarly to the available crystal structures of the ligand-bound GPCRs were considered for docking. Thus, ECL2 conformations that prevented entrance to the putative binding cavity were excluded for the next steps. The available model of FFA1 (21), with the side-chain conformers optimized according to mutagenesis data for HisVI:16/4.56, ArgV:05/ 5.39, HisVI:20/6.55, and ArgVII:02/7.35, was used to optimize the rough homology models of hFFA2 and hFFA3 obtained. Docking of SCAs into these models and those containing proposed mutants was performed using the Glide module of Schr\u00f6dinger software (22). The Glide docking box included the cavity between transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 involving residues at positions V:05/5.39, VII:02/7.35, and VI:20/6.55, which we have shown to be crucial for anchoring the carboxyl group of fatty acids (18).

Both receptors couple to the Pertussis toxin-sensitive G\u2423 i/o family of G proteins, whereas FFA2 additionally couples to the G\u2423 q/11 family (6 -8, 18). To avoid any potential bias in our assay results due to functional selectivity of tested ligands, we used the holistic, labelfree Epic DMR assay, which monitors integrated traffic in the cell in real time without the need for epitope tagging or specific receptor probes (19,24). Previously, we have demonstrated that DMR is a powerful assay platform for discerning the individual pathways activated by different GPCRs from all four G protein classes (G\u2423 i/o , G\u2423 s , G\u2423 q/11 , and G\u2423 12/13 ) and is therefore unbiased yet also pathway-sensitive (19). Thus, we initially tested the standard straight-chain orthosteric FFA2/FFA3 agonists, formate (C1), acetate (C2), propionate (C3), butyrate (C4), and valerate (C5), using the Epic DMR assay and compared these results with those obtained with the traditional [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S binding assay, which measures predominantly G\u2423 i/o G protein activation (and hence is appropriate for both FFA2 and FFA3 signaling). In addition, second messenger accumulation in whole cells was examined using IP 1 assays for FFA2 and cAMP accumulation assays for FFA3.",

Despite this, C1 and C2 had marked selectivity for FFA2 over FFA3 (\u232cpEC 50 of \u03fe1.8 and \u03fe1.3 for C1 and C2, respectively, where positive \u232cpEC 50 indicates selectivity for FFA2 and a negative number represents FFA3 selectivity).

SCAs with polar substituents, like 26 and 27, or larger structures, like 28, were close to inactive on both receptors.

Isobutyrate, isovalerate (2), and pivalate (3), representing bulkier methyl-substituted analogs of propionate and butyrate, have previously been reported to be at least an order of magnitude more selective for FFA3 over FFA2 (7). We also found these ligands to be selective for FFA3 over FFA2 (\u232cpEC 50 \u03fd\u03ea0.4 for 2 and \u03fd\u03ea0.7 for 3; Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1), and this relationship extended to sec-valerate (4; \u232cpEC 50 \u03fd\u03ea0.7; Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, although selective for FFA3, both 2 and 4 were poorly efficacious at this receptor in the DMR assay, an observation that was consistent at the other signaling assays for 4 but not 2. Cyclopropylcarboxylate (5), a somewhat bulkier analog of C3, exhibited moderate selectivity for FFA3, which was maintained upon replacing the cyclopropyl with cyclobutyl (6). The bulky cyclopropyl analog (7) was equi-potent with C3 on FFA3 and was \u03f330-fold selective for FFA3 over FFA2. A similar selectivity was observed for the cyclopropyl analog 8. In each instance these ligands displayed close to full agonism at FFA3 (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table 1). Based upon these findings, branched and cyclic SCAs appear to be selective for FFA3 over FFA2 at a variety of signaling readouts.",

Introduction of a triple bond with propargylate (14) resulted in a ligand markedly more selective for FFA2 (\u232cpEC 50 \u03fe 1.3; Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1) with little to no activity observed in either the Epic DMR assay or second messenger assays for FFA3. For FFA2, methyl substitutions were accommodated at all positions on acrylate (16-20) (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table 1). In contrast, FFA3 was far less tolerant to conjugated unsaturated compounds. Of the ligands tested, trans-3-methyl (16), cis-3-methyl (17), and 2-methyl (18) substitutions were moderately active with reduced efficacy and, for 17, reduced potency in both the DMR and signaling assays (\u232cpEC 50 \u03ed 0.6).

Overall, we found that C1, C2, and all conjugated unsaturated carboxylic acids exhibited substantial selectivity for FFA2, whereas the remaining compounds exhibited selectivity for FFA3. Thus, we propose that ligands with sp 2 -or sp-hybridized \u2423-carbon preferentially activate FFA2, whereas FFA3-selective ligands contain a substituted sp 3 -hybridized \u2423-carbon. Furthermore, this relationship indicates that the binding pockets of FFA2 and FFA3 must be subtly different despite both receptors requiring the same four basic amino acids for SCFA binding (18).",

            "text": "To examine the molecular determinants of SCA ligand selectivity, we docked the FFA2-selective compound 20 (Fig. 5A) and FFA3-selective compound 7 (Fig. 5B) into our molecular models of the receptors. Because 12 also showed receptor-specific effects, albeit on efficacy rather than potency in the [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S assay, we also modeled 12 at FFA3 (Fig. 5C). We have previously demonstrated that SCFA binding requires two conserved arginine residues in both FFA2 and FFA3, ArgV:05/ 5.39 and ArgVII:08/7.35 (numbered according to the systems of Schwartz and Baldwin (25,41,42) and Ballesteros and Weinstein (26)), which are presumed to act as anchoring residues for the carboxylic acid on SCFAs (18). As expected, the carboxyl group of each of the ligands is coordinating these arginines in the models, and the ligands are placed in the cavity com- prising transmembrane helices 3, 5, and 6 ( Fig. 5, A and B). In particular, the SCA is surrounded by Tyr 90 (III:09/3.33), Glu 166 (ECL2), Phe 168 (ECL2), Leu 183 (V:08/5.42), Cys 184 (V:09/ 5.43), Tyr 238 (VI:16/6.51), and His 242 (VI:20/6.55) in hFFA2 and by Phe 96 (III:09/3.33), Leu 171 (ECL2), Phe 173 (ECL2), Met 188 (V: 08/5.42), Ala 189 (V:09/5.43), Tyr 241 (VI:16/6.51), and His 245 (VI: 20/6.55) in hFFA3. We noted that the non-conserved residues closest to the aliphatic moiety are residues at positions III:09/ 3.33, V:08/5.42, and V:09/5.43 and Glu 166 /Leu 171 in ECL2. The aromatic residues at position III:09/3.33 form hydrophobic interactions with the ligand; the tyrosine OH group at this position in FFA2 is predicted to interact with the carboxyl group of 20. It is unlikely that this hydrogen-bond is crucial for binding, however, because the conserved positively charged arginines already anchor this group; thus, this residue is not thought to contribute to ligand selectivity. Of the remaining non-conserved residues within the predicted binding pocket, amino acids at positions 5.42 and 5.43 are likely to provide hydrophobic interactions with the aliphatic moiety of the SCAs. Glu 166 (ECL2) of FFA2 forms a salt bridge with Arg 255 (VII:08/ 7.35), thereby coordinating the position of Arg 255 , whereas Leu 171 (ECL2) of FFA3 has hydrophobic interactions with ligands 7 and 12 ( Fig. 5C). Because our SAR data indicated that FFA3 preferred larger saturated or alicyclic moieties within the SCAs compared with FFA2, which preferred flat unsaturated moieties, we calculated the volume of the orthosteric binding sites. In accordance with our SAR studies, we found that the modeled binding site volume of FFA3 (105 \u00c5 3 ) is more than double the volume of FFA2 (41 \u00c5 3 ). This difference may be due to the presence of the non-conserved residues discussed earlier as well as different residue packing caused by overall sequence differences between the receptors. To verify that our models and, therefore, our binding pocket hypotheses were predictive, we next examined signaling at a series of orthosteric binding site mutants.",

By making such a triple mutant receptor, we aimed to change the architecture of the binding pocket to more closely resemble that of FFA3 and, if our hypotheses were correct, change the selectivity of ligands acting at this receptor. Thus, the FFA2 residues Glu 166 (ECL2), Leu 183 (V:08/5.42), and Cys 184 (V:09/5.43) were substituted by the corresponding FFA3 residues Leu, Met, and Ala, respectively (hereafter referred to as \"FFA2 triple\") within the context of hFFA2-eYFP (Fig. 7, A and B). Compounds 7 and 12 were subsequently docked in the model of FFA2 triple, indicating that mutation of these residues was consistent with facilitating FFA3 ligand binding. We again calculated the volume of the ligand binding site (this time at FFA2 triple) and found that exchange of the FFA3 residues within FFA2 increased the volume of the orthosteric site (50 \u00c5 3 ), favoring accommodation of the bulkier 7 (Fig. 7A) and 12 (Fig. 7B), which are now located deeper within the pocket. Thus, to examine whether the triple mutant could lead to reversal of ligand selectivity at FFA2, a stable inducible Flp-In T-REx 293 cell line was established. FFA2 triple expression was assessed using eYFP fluorescence as a surrogate parameter and found to be at a level similar to wild type hFFA2-eYFP and not significantly different from wild type hFFA3-eYFP (Fig. 7C).",

Propionate potency at FFA2 triple was identical to wild type FFA2 and FFA3 (Fig. 7D), indicating that these modifications to the orthosteric binding site of FFA2 did not cause gross changes in receptor conformation. Consistent with the Epic DMR assay data in Fig. 4A, 20 was selective for FFA2 because it was inactive at FFA3 (Fig. 7E). Critically, however, activity of 20 at FFA2 triple was markedly impaired, suggesting that the binding pocket could no longer effectively accommodate or be activated by this sp 2 ligand (Fig.  7E). Because of their differing effects on selectivity and efficacy in the [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S assay, we also examined both 7 and 12 at the FFA2 triple chimera. The highly selective and bulky compound 7 displayed \u03fe100-fold selectivity for FFA3 over FFA2 (pEC 50 \u03ed 3.76 \u03ee 0.26 at FFA3 and pEC 50 \u03ed 1.65 \u03ee 0.17 at FFA2; Fig. 7F). Mutation within the FFA2 orthosteric binding pocket was able to rescue 7 function at FFA2 as this ligand displayed equivalent potency at FFA2 triple and the FFA3 receptor (pEC 50 \u03ed 3.80 \u03ee 0.12) ( Fig. 7F), although full agonism was not achieved. Conversely, although ligand 12 was highly selective for FFA3 in the DMR and second messenger assays ( Fig. 3 and Table 1), in the [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S assay, it was equipotent at the wild type receptors but differed in the magnitude of signal effect. Interestingly, this poor efficacy at FFA2 wild type was completely reversed at FFA2 triple with maximum activation even exceeding that of wild type FFA3 (Fig. 7G). Thus, guided by developing a chemical rule for predicting specific activation of SCFA receptors and in conjunction with molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to transfer FFA3 selectivity to FFA2.

The physiological roles of the two receptors have largely been based on studies with knock-out mice. The expression of FFA2, however, was recently found to be reduced in FFA3 knock-out mice, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions from these studies (27). Limited endogenous ligand selectivity, the low potency of these ligands, and the absence of selective orthosteric compounds are therefore currently major obstacles to the exploration of the physiological and pathological roles of these receptors both in vitro and in vivo (15). In the present study, we sought to address this issue by examining the molecular determinants of ligand selectivity at FFA2. By screening a targeted library of SCAs at FFA2 and counterscreening at FFA3 using the holistic Epic DMR biosensor assay, we discovered a series of ligands with selectivity for either receptor. SAR analysis of the screening hits in combination with molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis enabled formulation of a general chem- ical rule to predict receptor preference of SCAs. Three amino acids were identified as critical for selective orthosteric activation of FFA2, and transfer of these residues to the binding pocket of FFA3 was sufficient to confer FFA3 ligand selectivity to the FFA2 receptor. Our findings therefore provide the first description of the determinants of selective orthosteric activation for FFA2.",

            "text": "Propionate is the most potent SCFA at both FFA2 and FFA3 and displays close to maximal LE for both these receptors; i.e. it is highly potent based on its size. Although increased potency requires larger ligands, here we demonstrate that development of small but selective ligands is indeed feasible. In fact, 20 and 21 represent two notable examples as they are both selective and potent given their size. These two ligands are expected to be instrumental for the design of novel selective orthosteric FFA2 activators. A multifaceted program combining the validated molecular model of FFA2 described herein with fragment-based drug discovery may facilitate the identification of ligands with enhanced potency either by \"growing\" the ligands stepwise or by linking the SCAs to fragments docked at accessible positions within the receptor (13). In recent times, a series of receptors have been shown to be activated by endogenous small molecule ligands that are more traditionally considered as products of intermediary metabolism (28 -31). All of these ligands have modest potency at their target receptors, and the concepts elucidated and discussed here may have general value in the identification of selective and more potent orthosteric agonists. This is particularly relevant as the potential therapeutic implications of many of these receptors, e.g. GPR109A, clearly define a need to develop potent and selective agonists rather than antagonists (32,33). A well defined shape was a criterion for selection of screening compounds to facilitate SAR analysis and modeling. Apart from C5, they only have zero to two rotatable bonds (defined as the number of non-cyclic single bonds where rotation leads to a change in the position of non-hydrogen atoms relative to the remaining molecule; e.g. 14 has zero rotatable bonds). These ligands adopt a very limited number of possible conformations and are therefore ideally suited for modeling and docking studies at the FFA2 binding site. Indeed, evidence of the accuracy of our FFA2 model and SCA docking is provided by the fact that we were able to identify the anchoring arginines for the carboxylic acid group in transmembrane domain V and transmembrane domain VII and transfer ligand selectivity between FFA2 and FFA3 by exchanging just three key amino acids. Very few examples of such a transfer of ligand selectivity between GPCR binding sites have been described. A notable example is the transfer of the binding of AMD3100 from CXCR4 to CXCR3 achieved by a double mutation and the presence of two essential aspartates conserved in both receptors (34).",

            "text": "It is well known from a number of studies that receptor pharmacology may vary depending on the cellular context and the signaling end point under investigation (35)(36)(37)(38). The SCFA receptors examined herein are known to engage with G\u2423 i/o family proteins (FFA3) or with both G\u2423 i/o and G\u2423 q/11 (FFA2). This implies that, at least for FFA2, ligands may be identified with preference for individual signaling pathways. To rule out the possibility that so-called biased ligands may escape detection when using a single functional end point assay, one can either gather biological information by testing compounds in several parallel assays or rather use one of the novel, label-free assay technologies that capture whole cell responses in a manner comparable with tissue bioassays (24, 39,40). The latter may also have the advantage that ligand activity will reflect an integrated response of a living cell rather than a readout determined in isolation and underappreciative of intertwined signaling networks that overlap in time and space. In our study, we took advantage of the Corning Epic biosensor, which translates receptor activation into real time optical traces in a pathwayunbiased yet pathway-sensitive manner (19) and chose this method for primary screening. Hit confirmation was performed with classical biochemical ([ 35 S]GTP\u2425S) or second messenger (cAMP and IP 1 ) assays as validation. The majority of hits identified using the holistic approach were also confirmed in the classical assays. However, we also noted the existence of compounds such as 10 with activity in the Epic but complete inactivity in [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S binding assays. Lack of [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S incorporation induced by 10 at FFA2 might be explained by its inability to engage G\u2423 i/o signaling; however, inactivity at FFA3 of 10 is hard to rationalize given that activity was also detected in parallel cAMP inhibition assays. Hence, it is possible that the receptor-proximal [ 35 S]GTP\u2425S binding assay is simply not sensitive enough to identify activators with poor potency and efficacy because this is likely to be linked closely to receptor occupancy, whereas more distal signals, such as those measured in the DMR assay, often provide substantial amplification and receptor reserve (39). In contrast, 2 was hardly active in DMR assays on either receptor but appeared to be a high efficacy agonist in GTP\u2425S binding. As DMR is an integrated signal, the absence of positive DMR for 2 may reflect additional but opposing cellular events triggered by this compound. Overall, these data demonstrate the strength of combining traditional end point with novel holistic assays to unravel mechanistic differences of compounds that would remain unexplored when using either method in isolation.",

Acrylate (13) is the parent compound of most of these and has agonist activity comparable with C3 yet preferentially activates FFA2 over FFA3. All substituted acrylates (16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21)(22) were FFA2 agonists and showed preference or in most cases significant selectivity for FFA2 over FFA3. These results indicate that the binding pocket of FFA2 has a narrow shape, and steric restrictions apply in the area around the \u2423-carbon atoms of the SCFAs. The preferred planar structure around the carboxylic acid due to conjugation is likely to be a significant factor in FFA2 selectivity. These observations have led to the identification of a general rule to predict FFA2 versus FFA3 selectivity of small (\u03fd6 carbon atoms) carboxylic acids with lipophilic tails: compounds carrying an sp 2 -or sp-hybridized \u2423-carbon will be FFA2-selective, whereas compounds carrying a substituted sp 3 -hybridized \u2423-carbon will be FFA3-selective.
