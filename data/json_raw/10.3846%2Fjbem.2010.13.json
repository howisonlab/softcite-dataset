Quantile regression was used as a more suitable methodology to measure the determinants of firm size. Our results show that the main sets of explanatory variables related to founder characteristics (age, experience, education, and vocation) provide a full explanation of firm size. We have also found evidence that a high degree strategic planning and a better competitive position are positively related to firm size as well. Finally, environmental factors were less representative."

Over the last several decades, new firm growth has become a popular research topic, especially since Birch (1979) found that new firms had created the majority of new employment in the U.S. In this respect, the SME sector's contribution to the economy has attracted the attention of academics and policy makers in both developed economies and those in transition (Krasniqi 2007).",

According Perry and Serven (2003) Argentina outperformed most other economies in the region until 1997 in terms of growth per capita (see Table 1) in a relatively benign external environment, in spite of a short-lived interruption in 1995 1 . But after the major slowdown in growth in 1999 that affected the whole region, mainly due to capital flow retrenchment after the Russian crisis, other countries in the region began a modest recovery, while Argentina plunged into a protracted recession, reversing most of her previous gains at poverty reduction. In this context, the bulk of papers are devoted to examine to which extent and why was the Argentine economy more vulnerable to adverse external shocks than other Latin American economies, and to what extent were policy mistakes the main culprit. In Roubini (2001), it examines the vulnerabilities associated with deflationary adjustments to shocks under a hard peg. In Sachs (2002) the focus is the public debt, the fragile fiscal position and the strength in the banking sector.",

In order to explain the firm growth and its determinants, this paper uses Storey's (1994) analytical framework as its main guide. This framework proposes three main factors that can be seen as a variety of different elements: resources and characteristics of the entrepreneur (individual), the firm (organizational), strategy and environment.",

In this respect, entrepreneurs consciously select strategies and their choices, at least in part, reflect their views on what the optimal strategy should be in a given environment. Porter (1980) identifies three broad business-level choices: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. Focus refers to competitive strategies that target a particular set of customers for a product line, or geographical market. The low-cost strategy involves the construction of efficient-scale facilities, the aggressive pursuit of cost reduction in all functions of organizations. Differentiation strategies are designed to create and market innovative, high-quality products and/or services. The three competitive strategies are alternative, viable options to deal with the environmental forces, and to outperform firms that implement combined strategies. However, various authors suggest that strategy should be adapted to the environment (Tushman and Romanelli 1985;Sandberg and Hofer 1987). In this respect, McDougall et al. (1992) found that, with regard to small firm growth, broad strategies were more successful, thus questioning the otherwise common niche argument (Davidsson et al. 2005).",

The present distribution does not conform to the statistical distributions that have been suggested in the literature which underlie the firm size distribution. However, our data do not have a normal distribution and thus dependent variables were transformed into a logarithm. As was mentioned before, one of the relevant factors to understand managerial growth is knowing the type of actions carried out by entrepreneurship. To determine this, three questions associated to the strategic aspects were formulated. First, How often is the planning process carried out? (annually, quarterly, monthly, or none). Second, which competitive position does their company occupy with respect to their most direct competitors? (1 = very weak to 5 = very strong  respect to their most direct competitors? (1 = smaller, 2 = equal, 3 = larger, 4 = not known). Likewise, market expectations play an important role mainly on the manager's decisions which have a direct impact on company growth, given the conditions during the Argentinean crisis to which this paper refers. In this respect, besides controlling with dummy variables for county and sector, the manager was asked about his/her market estimate (1 = expansive, 2 = recessive, 3 = stable, 4 = not known). Finally, this section ends by presenting the descriptive statistics of the variables used which can be found below in Table 4. ",

The model is developed along the lines of small business economic theory (see, for example , Evans 1987;Jovanovic 1982). According to Basu and Goswami (1999), for the purposes of statistical analysis, Equation (1) can be transformed into a double log linear specification as follows: The empirical model specified in Equation 2is estimated using the Regression Quantiles (RQ) estimator as was introduced by Bassett (1978, 1982). Quantile regression allows the effects of independent variables x is to be quantified at different points along the conditional distribution of the dependent variable y i . Assuming that the distribution function F of y is continuous, this is the \u03b8th quantile (0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1), and \u03a8 \u03b8 is the value at which P(y <\u03a8 \u03b8 ) = F(\u03a8 \u03b8 ) = \u03b8. While OLS measures the effect of explanatory variables on the conditional mean of y, quantile regression measures the effect at any point along the conditional distribution, for example at the 50 th percentile (i.e., median), 75 th percentile, etc. Mata and Machado (1996) point out a number of advantages of using the RQ estimator instead of standard lest square regression models. According to G\u00f6rg and Strobl (2002), one of the advantages is that RQ enables different slope parameters to be estimated at different quantiles along the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. This may prove particularly valuable when estimating the effect of industry covariates on the start-up size of firms, where one may expect, for example, small firms (or entrants) to be affected differently by, say, minimum efficient scale (MES) than large firms. This should then be reflected in differences in the coefficients on the MES for the low and high quantiles of the conditional distribution for start-up size.",

In this respect, in the 0.1 and 0.25 quantiles, as the manager's experience and age increases, firm growth increases, although the effects that a combination of age and experience have are negative.

The empirical answers provided by our analysis support the theoretical proposition that the higher the degree of general and specific Human this strongly related with the size of the firm. This result is related to those reached by Mata (1996) and Almus (2002). A positive effect of education on firm size has been extensively reported (Cooper et al. 1994;Burke et al. 2002). Personality theories point to the importance of personal predispositions for venture success. In this context, a number of traits and motives of successful entrepreneurs have been identified, but these concepts have typically produced weak relationships with venture performance (Baum et al. 2001). However, our results were able to confirm the positive influence of motivation on firm size.",

We have also found evidence that a better competitive situation and knowledge of the competition is connected with larger. This result is interesting because competitive strategies reflect the choices of managers. Thus, the determinants of individual decision making and behavior are among the determinants of strategy because people choose plans in part on the basis of: a) what they are predisposed to do, b) what they are motivated to do, and c) what they think they can do (Bandura 1986;Hollenbeck and Whitener 1988).",

The relatively low impact of the environmental domain on firm size (market estimate, location, sectors) is perhaps surprising. Although other studies have found similar results in this direction, such as Baum et al. (2001). In our case, a possible explanation could be derived from the widespread crisis that existed during the period of analysis. However, De Jorge et al. (2007) indicated differences in regional dynamism as well as the relevant heterogeneity of the typology of different entrepreneurs in Argentina. In this respect, future research should explore the role played by environment on firm size and subsequent growth. It is also necessary to use longitudinal data for firms in order to monitor their employment change. Efforts should be made to further study the growth of new firms using data sets that are as comparable as possible across different countries in Latin America.",
