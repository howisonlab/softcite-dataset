            "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of DA-9801, an optimized extract of Dioscorea species, on diabetic peripheral neuropathy in a type 2 diabetic animal model. In this study, db/db mice were treated with DA-9801 (30 and 100 mg/kg, daily, p.o.) for 12 weeks. DA-9801 reduced the blood glucose levels and increased the withdrawal latencies in hot plate tests. Moreover, it prevented nerve damage based on increased nerve conduction velocity and ultrastructural changes. Decrease of nerve growth factor (NGF) may have a detrimental effect on diabetic neuropathy. We previously reported NGF regulatory properties of the Dioscorea genus. In this study, DA-9801 induced NGF production in rat primary astrocytes. In addition, it increased NGF levels in the sciatic nerve and the plasma of type 2 diabetic animals. DA-9801 also increased neurite outgrowth and mRNA expression of Tieg1/Klf10, an NGF target gene, in PC12 cells. These results demonstrated the attenuation of diabetic peripheral neuropathy by oral treatment with DA-9801 via NGF regulation. DA-9801 is currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study."

            "text": "Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus usually develop severe complications such as microvascular and macrovascular diseases, retinopathy, liver and brain dysfunctions, and neuropathy (Gerbitz et al., 1995;Toth et al., 2006). Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes mellitus, with nerve damage developing in over 50% of all diabetic patients. It is associated with chronic aberrant sensations, numbness, and pain, which affect quality of life, disrupt sleep, and can lead to depression (Vinik et al., 1995;Vinik et al., 2000;Calcutt, 2004;Canta et al., 2009). Currently, drugs for diabetic neuropathy have been limited to those that reduce pain and relieve other symptoms. The antiepileptics gabapentin (GABA) and the antioxidant \u03b1-lipoic acid (LA) are common drugs used to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. However, GABA has been reported to cause side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, and peripheral edema (FDA, 2009). LA can cause nausea or stomach upset, fatigue, and insomnia (Singh and Jialal, 2008). Therefore, research is underway to find safer candidates for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.",

They include long-standing hyperglycemia, increased flux of the polyol pathway, enhanced non-enzymatic advanced glycation end-product formation, free radical and oxidative stress, and impaired nerve growth factor (NGF) support (Zorrilla Hernandez et al., 1994;Sima and Sugimoto, 1999;van Dam, 2002;Obrosova, 2003;Vincent et al., 2004). Several studies suggest that NGF deficiency may be one of the major risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy (Hellweg and Hartung, 1990;Apfel et al., 1994;Hellweg et al., 1994;Ordonez et al., 1994;Anand et al., 1996).

            "text": "In oriental medicine, the dried rhizome of Dioscorea japonica Thunb (D. japonica, known as \"SanYak\" in Korea) is a representative nourishing and tonifying herb. Its taste is sweet, and its nature is neutral. It supplements Ki, fortifi es the spleen, supplements the lungs and the kidney, and secures the essence. It has been traditionally used for diarrhea and dysentery due to spleen defi ciency, fatigue, coughing and wheezing, wasting and thirsting, seminal emission, vaginal discharge, and frequent urination. The dried rhizome of Dioscorea nipponica Makino (D. nipponica) is called \"Buchema\" in Korea, and is an herb for clearing and transforming phlegmheat. Its taste is bitter and its nature is cold. It dissipates lumps and disperses goiter, clears heat, relieves toxicity, cools the blood, stops bleeding and coughing, and calms wheezing. It has been applied for goiter and scrofula, swelling and toxins of sores, poisonous snake bites, bleeding due to blood-heat, and whooping cough (Xu and Wang, 2002). Many species of Dioscorea have traditionally been used clinically in Asia for the treatment of various syndromes related to metabolic diseases. Moreover, the extracts of the Dioscorea species have been reported to have antidiabetic and antiobesity effects (Hikino et al., 1986;Gao et al., 2007;Maithili et al., 2011). In particular, D. japonica has inhibitory activities on polyuria and diabetes (Kim, 1998) and D. nipponica has antiobesity properties (Jung et al., 2003). Previously, we reported that furostanol saponins isolated from D. japonica upregulated NGF contents in rat glioma C6 cells (Kim et al., 2011a) and diosgenin from D. nipponica ameliorated diabetic neuropathy by increasing the endogenous NGF levels in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice (Kang et al., 2011). Therefore, we proposed that these two Dioscorea species might improve various symptoms of diabetic neuropathy via NGF regulation. Through activity-guided in vivo screening, we selected an optimized combination drug DA-9801, a mixture of D. japonica and D. nipponica (KR Patent No. 10-1341692-0000). NGF agonistic activities of DA-9801 in PC12 cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons were recently reported (Kim et al., 2011b). Jin et al. also reported that oral treatment with DA-9801 had therapeutic potential for peripheral neuropathy in a representative type 1 diabetic animal model, STZ-induced diabetic rats (Jin et al., 2013). According to this report, DA-9801 improved tactile and thermal hyperalgesia, and blunted the morphological changes and the reduction of intraepidermal nerve fi ber density. Moreover, it increased NGF and decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-6 protein levels in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord. These results indicated that DA-9801 might prevent peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats via enhancement of neurotrophic activity and anti-infl ammatory response. Previously, our group described that DA-9801 improved nerve conduction velocity (NCV) signifi cantly in type 2 diabetic db/ db mice (Choi and Son, 2011). However, further investigations of DA-9801 in peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic animal models have not been reported. Because of the higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than type 1, it is very importance to check the impact of DA-9801 on type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of DA-9801 on improvement of peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. In particular, to determine its therapeutic mechanism, we focused on the NGF regulatory activity of DA-9801.",

The contents of NGF in the medium were 31.7 \u00b1 5.8 pg/ml in control cells and 319.6 \u00b1 2.3 and 609.4 \u00b1 57.1 pg/ml in DA-9801-treated cells (100 and 200 mg/ml), respectively. Moreover, DA-9801 increased NGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner in rat primary astrocytes (Fig. 2B). We also measured NGF levels in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice treated with DA-9801. Our results showed that NGF levels in the sciatic nerves were increased by oral administration of DA-9801. The NGF content was 6.2 \u00b1 0.5 pg/ml in control mice. However, the DA-9801-treated mice secreted 9.9 \u00b1 0.3 pg/ml (DA-9801 30 mg/kg) and 11.6 \u00b1 1.0 pg/ml of NGF (DA-9801 100 mg/kg), respectively (Fig. 2C). In the plasma of db/db mice, NGF concentration was also increased by treatment with DA-9801 100 mg/kg (Fig. 2D). In both the sciatic nerves and the plasma of db/db mice, LA and GABA had no influence on NGF induction.",

            "text": "One of the important pathological factors of diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage. Nerve damage such as the loss and centripetal degeneration of small myelinated axons in diabetic neuropathy is likely associated with a marked deprivation of NGF. Jin et al. reported the therapeutic potential of DA-9801 on the peripheral neuropathy via enhancement of neurotrophic activity in STZ-induced diabetic rats, a representative type 1 diabetic model (Jin et al., 2013). To extend the research on DA-9801, we investigated whether DA-9801 had therapeutic activity for peripheral neuropathy via NGF regulation in db/ db mice, a type 2 diabetic animal model. In the present study, oral administration of DA-9801 significantly reduced hyperalgesia by increasing the response latency to noxious thermal stimuli in db/db mice. DA-9801-administrated group showed higher NCVs of sensory and motor nerves than each diabetic control group. Accordingly, DA-9801 may have a therapeutic effect on nerve injury due to diabetic neuropathy by increasing the transmission speed of the nerves of db/db mice. Moreover, the therapeutic effect of the DA-9801 on the neuropathy was identified by measuring the histological change of the sciatic nerves. Namely, in the DA-9801-treated groups, the axon and the myelin sheath in the central part of the sciatic nerve clearly expanded. These data show that DA-9801 can protect and treat the shrunken sciatic nerves in the neuropathy in type 2 diabetic condition. Moreover, DA-9801 increased NGF production in rat primary astrocytes. In addition, the amounts of endogenous NGF in the sciatic nerves and the plasma of DA-9801-treated db/db mice were significantly higher than that of control mice. Therefore, our results indicate that oral treatment with DA-9801 might improve peripheral neuropathy by suppressing the degeneration and death of neurons in type 2 diabetes via NGF induction.",

            "text": "Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes, accounting for about 90% of all diabetes cases. Its main pathological cause is insulin resistance which associated with aging, obesity, and lack of physical activity (Boden, 2001). Therefore, the importance of investigating type 2 diabetes and its complications has increased markedly with the trends of an increasingly aging and obese society. Previously, Jin et al. reported that oral treatment with DA-9801 at a single dose of 100 mg/ kg/day for 16 weeks had therapeutic properties for peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats via enhancement of neurotrophic activity (Jin et al., 2013). They used Sprague-Dawley rats injected intraperitoneally with STZ 60 mg/kg in their research. Their animal model was a late-state type 2 diabetic or typical type 1 diabetic model. However, chemicalinduced diabetic animals have some disadvantages in a general type 2 diabetes study. Hyperglycemia develops primarily by direct cytotoxic actions on the \u03b2 cells and insulin deficiency, rather than as a consequence of insulin resistance. Moreover, these animals cannot show the phenotype of obesity. However, db/db mice, in which diabetes develops spontaneously with genetic background, can develop characteristic features resembling human type 2 diabetes (Srinivasan and Ramarao, 2007). Therefore, db/db mice are a more suitable animal model than STZ-induced diabetic rats in the study of human type 2 diabetes and its complications. Thus, our research showed the therapeutic effect of DA-9801 on peripheral neuropathy via NGF regulation in general type 2 diabetes. In comparison, Jin's research ascertained the attenuation of neuropathy by DA-9801 treatment in type 1 and late type 2 diabetes. And to conclude, DA-9801 might improve peripheral neuropathy via NGF regulation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",

GABA, as a first line drug for the regulation neuropathic pain, is used to relieve diabetic neuropathic pain. Also, there is evidence that LA may help with control of diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, we decided to use GABA and LA as alternative positive controls because they are drugs used to ameliorate the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Sure, GABA or LA is not perfect positive control of diabetic neuropathy because of its side effects and low efficacy. Considering these aspects, we used LA or GABA as a proper positive control. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of GABA and/or LA on neuropathic pain in www.biomolther.org db/db mice have not been reported yet.

However, the effects of DA-9801 on blood glucose levels, NCVs and nerve histology might be independent of the dose. The thermal response latencies and NGF levels in sciatic nerves showed increasing tendencies but there was no statistical significance between the two doses. These dose-independent effects may be caused by various ingredients in DA-9801. Therefore, more research on various doses of DA-9801 and its most active compounds in diabetic neuropathy are needed in in vivo animal systems. According to previous studies, we suggest that furostanol sapogenins (Kim et al., 2011a) and diosgenin (Kang et al., 2011) may be the main active components of DA-9801.",

            "text": "Nerve damage and diabetic neuropathic pain can be induced by various pathological causes such as increased aldose reductase activity, angiotensin-converting enzyme activation, and the proinflammatory response (Obrosova, 2009). Previous studies reported that many Dioscorea species exert potential activities against these pathological factors in various experimental models. Dioscorea opposite prevents the increase of serum aldose reductase activity in STZ-induced diabetic mice (Hayes et al., 1987). The tuber storage protein of Dioscorea alata, dioscorin (Hsu et al., 2002), and red mold Dioscorea (Wu et al., 2009) exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities. Moreover, some Dioscorea species and their constituents are known to have anti-inflammatory properties (Oh and Lim, 2008;Hiransai et al., 2010;Nguelefack et al., 2010;Mbiantcha et al., 2011). Considering the previous references, the inhibitory activities of DA-9801 on diabetic neuropathy may be exerted by multi-targeted pharmacological activities of the Dioscorea species. Jin et al. also reported that DA-9801 had therapeutic properties for peripheral neuropathy in STZ-induced diabetic rats via NGF regulation and an antiinflammatory response. DA-9801 decreased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-6 protein levels in the sciatic nerve and spinal cord (Jin et al., 2013). Therefore, further studies of the potential mechanism of DA-9801, especially its anti-inflammatory properties, in peripheral neuropathy in a type 2 diabetic model are needed. Due to the different pathogenesis between type 1 diabetes and type 2diabetes, their induced inflammation may also be followed by different features. Especially, the main pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, results in complex alterations of lipid and glucose homeostasis, which lead to systemic inflammation (Pedicino et al., 2013). In previous comparative study of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, the level of an inflammation marker was higher in serum of type 2 diabetic patients than in that of type 1 diabetic patients (Pedicino et al., 2013). Therefore, if DA-9801 can promote peripheral neuropathy via its anti-inflammatory activity in type 2 diabetes, it is possible that this activity would be more sensitive in type 2 diabetes than type 1diabetes.",

            "text": "This study shows that DA-9801, a novel botanical drug from the Dioscorea species, reduced blood glucose levels and increased the response latency to noxious thermal stimuli. It also improved peripheral nerve damage by increasing NCVs and ameliorating abnormal nerve histology in db/db type 2 diabetic mice. These results may have occurred partially due to the effect of DA-9801 on NGF regulation. Currently, DA-9801 is being evaluated in a phase II clinical study. We expect that DA-9801 can be used as a botanical drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy."
