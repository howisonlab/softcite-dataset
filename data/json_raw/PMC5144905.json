For example, the annual cost of treatment for a patient with COPD is $9,981 in the USA and $3,224 in the UK. 4 Because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and an aging population, the global burden of COPD is expected to increase further in the coming years.",

Almost all patients have reduced physical activity, and they experience two or more symptoms every day. For this reason, patients with COPD must continuously use a high volume of medications, which produces a significant cost load. Although the possibility of reducing the cost of chronic medication is low, exacerbations might be reduced or prevented. Exacerbations   constitute 50%-75% of the economic load of COPD because of extra emergency department applications and increased hospitalizations. 18 Studies on the causality between treating exacerbations and slowing down the progression of COPD have indicated that successful management of the exacerbations is the main approach for reducing the costs, both directly and also indirectly, by slowing the progression of the disease. 1,16 In this study, the total cost of hospitalization due to COPD exacerbations was found to be $808. Previous studies have reported a wide range of cost per hospitalization (between $612 and $9,545). [5][6][7][19][20][21][22][23][24] In this study, while the cost of hospital stays composes the main portion of total costs (40.7%), other costs such as those for medication, consumption of materials, consultations, and doctor visits, plus laboratory expenditures, constitute a significant percentage of total costs. In previous studies, the main cost is associated with hospital stays, followed by laboratory expenditures and medication costs. 19,20 Therefore, a major reduction in COPD-related costs could be achieved by reducing the expenditures of staying in hospital.",

            "text": "The main reason for the hospitalization of COPD patients is the presence of comorbidities with or without exacerbation: these patients have a higher prevalence of comorbid diseases compared to the general population. 12,13 Although the mechanisms by which COPD-related comorbidities develop are still unclear, it has been suggested that systemic inflammation contributes to the disease process. However, the causes of comorbidities are more likely to be multifactorial (eg, inactivity, poor diet, hypoxia, and inflammation). 1 Comorbidity existence is a critical factor associated with high mortality in COPD. 12,13 Diabetes, heart failure, renal failure, cancer, and neuropsychiatric diseases are common with aging and often occur together; 25,26 if any of these diseases exists, the possibility that others exist is higher in these individuals compared to healthy adults. 27 In a previous study, more than three comorbid disorders were observed in 46% of COPD patients. 28 In our study, two comorbid diseases were recorded in 28.9% of patients, the most common being hypertension, followed by other cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure, as well as diabetes mellitus. Similarly, in the literature, cerebrovascular disease, mainly hypertension, was reported to be the most common comorbidity in patients with COPD. 13,14,29 In a study by Miyazaki et al, 30 36% of patients with COPD had hypertension and 32% had cardiovascular disease, while 25% had cancer, 17% had mental disorders, and 15% had diabetes mellitus. In this study, comorbid disease was observed in 808 patients; the most common comorbid disease was hypertension, followed by other cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, anemia, anxiety/depression, and other disorders.",

The presence of comorbidities significantly increased the total costs associated with COPD exacerbations. The costs of COPD exacerbation associated with pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, anemia, lung cancer, arrhythmia, and anxiety/depression were found to be significantly higher than those associated with COPD without comorbidities. Comorbidities most significantly related to high costs were anemia, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, likely because they are the most common comorbid diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between the yearly costs of COPD and the number of comorbid diseases. 15,23,31 Perera et al 23 assessed the factors responsible for increasing costs for patients hospitalized due to exacerbation and reported a significant relation between increased costs and comorbidities, such as acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, arrhythmia, pulmonary thromboembolism, and low body weight. COPD patients with comorbidities require hospitalization, which lead to increased costs. Moreover, ~50% of COPD patients use cardiovascular medications and, more frequently, analgesic, antibiotics, and psychotherapeutic drugs. 31 One study of COPD patients with comorbid diseases showed direct costs that were 4.7 times higher than those for COPD patients with no comorbidity. 14 Similarly, our study found that the costs associated with comorbid diseases were 4.3 times higher. Pneumonia was found to be associated with both direct and indirect costs. Some studies have demonstrated that pneumonia increases total direct costs by 1.9-2.5 times for outpatients and by 3.39-4.72 times for hospitalized patients. 15,32 In this study, costs were 1.6 times higher in patients with pneumonia compared to those without pneumonia.",

            "text": "In this study, age .65 years, female gender, hospitalization in an intensive care unit, intubation, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and a long duration of hospitalization were factors increasing costs for patients with COPD exacerbations who required hospitalization. The mean duration of hospitalization was 8.1 days in this study. In previous studies, the mean duration was 4.5-14.5 days. [5][6][7]19,[22][23][24] A longer hospital duration is also associated with increased daily costs due to treatment-resistant, severe cases with many accompanying comorbidities in addition to increased expenditures for hospital stays. The relationship between increased costs and a lengthy hospital stay has been demonstrated in many studies. 6,23,33 In our study, the rate of exacerbations requiring hospitalization in intensive care units was 16% (n=841), and the mean hospitalization duration was 10.4 days. The mean cost of hospitalization in an intensive care unit was $1,977, which was 3.4 times higher compared to cases without intensive care unit hospitalization. Being followed by noninvasive mechanical ventilation or intubation was also found to be associated with increased costs. In cases who require hospitalization in intensive care units, the costs of laboratory tests and medications increase as hospitalization time is extended. Similar to our study, Dalal et al 22 reported that the duration of hospitalization was longer in terms of exacerbations requiring hospitalization in intensive care units and the cost was nearly doubled for cases in which patients were hospitalized in intensive care units compared to those who did not require intensive care hospitalization. Stanford et al 36 found that costs were nearly six times higher, and \u00d6rnek et al 6 noted that costs were tripled for COPD patients hospitalized in intensive care units.",

During routine follow-up, questioning the patient about, as well as managing the most common comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and arrhythmia might reduce the cost load. Furthermore, COPD patients have a sedentary lifestyle due to limitations of daily physical activities, which causes a tendency toward anxiety and depression. Thus, during routine visits, patients with advanced COPD should be evaluated with respect to their psychological mood and be provided with psychosocial support, pulmonary rehabilitation, and physical exercise programs. The implementation of these measures would decrease the cost load of COPD and increase the costeffectivity of managing the disease. Finally, the prevention of pneumonia through vaccination of COPD patients and avoiding the usage of unnecessary and high-dose inhaled steroids should also be considered in efforts to decrease the cost of COPD management."
