            "text": "In the present study, we developed a self-assembled biodegradable polyglutamic acid (PGA)-based formulation of amphotericin B (AmB) and evaluated its in vitro antifungal potential against Candida albicans. The AmB-loaded PGA nanoparticles were prepared in-house and had a mean size dimension of around 98\u00b12 nm with a zeta potential of-35.2\u00b17.3 mV. Spectroscopic studies revealed that the drug predominantly acquires an aggregated form inside the formulation with an aggregation ratio above 2. The PGA-based AmB formulation was shown to be highly stable in phosphate-buffered saline as well as in serum (only 10%-20% of the drug was released after 10 days). The AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles were less toxic to red blood cells (\ue02c15% lysis at an AmB concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL after 24 hours) when compared with Fungizone \u00ae , a commercial antifungal product. An MTT assay showed that the viability of mammalian cells (KB and RAW 264.7) was negligibly affected at AmB concentrations as high as 200 \u00b5g/mL. Histopathological examination of mouse kidney revealed no signs of tissue necrosis. The AmB\u2212PGA formulation showed potent antimicrobial activity similar to that of Fungizone against C. albicans. Interestingly, AmB-bearing PGA nanoparticles were found to inhibit biofilm formation to a considerable extent. In summary, AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles showed highly attenuated toxicity when compared with Fungizone, while retaining equivalent active antifungal properties. This study indicates that the AmB\u2212PGA preparation could be a promising treatment for various fungal infections.",

            "text": "Effective antifungal therapy often requires long treatment regimens lasting up to 30 days; this in turn leads to various toxic manifestations (eg, nausea, chills, fevers, vomiting). 5,6 Moreover, clinical use of AmB-D is often marred with acute and chronic infusion-related toxicities, the most serious being dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. 5,7,8 To circumvent AmB-D-related toxicity issues, various lipid formulations of AmB have been developed, including the commercially available AmBisome \u00ae (AmB-L), ie, liposomal AmB. 2,[9][10][11] AmB-L has a far superior therapeutic index with highly attenuated toxicity when compared with AmB-D. However, the complex process involved in the production of AmB-L, 12,13 its high cost, 14,15 and issues related to stability tend to offset its benefits and limit its utility, especially in third world countries. Since lipids are the principal constituent of the formulation, it is difficult to imagine AmB-L ever becoming affordable. Efforts to make generic forms that have efficacy comparable with existing formulations have met with limited success. 16,17 Furthermore, the existing AmB formulations are not therapeutically bioequivalent and are reported to have clear differences in toxicity. 16,18 Taking into consideration the various limitations associated with lipid formulations of AmB, 19 it would be desirable to develop alternative drug delivery systems that can be used widely in the treatment of an array of fungal diseases.",

            "text": "Much preclinical research on polymeric nanoparticles has suggested some potential for delivery of active drug substances. 20 Polymer nanoparticulate technologies can be used to improve water solubility and bioavailability of the active drug component. 21,22 Nanoparticles shield the drug from interacting directly with normal healthy cells, thus minimizing its detrimental effects to a considerable extent. Biodegradable polymers have also been shown to optimize pharmacokinetics (including controlled and prolonged release of the drug with tissue retention), improve efficacy, and address drug safety issues. 23 Our earlier efforts to develop a biodegradable polymer drug complex based on PLGA (poly[lactic-co-glycolic acid]) have been quite encouraging, 24,25 and led us to hypothesize that a delivery vehicle based on an analogous polymer, ie, polyglutamic acid (PGA), would have potential to circumvent the toxicity of AmB to a greater extent. PGA was selected for its biodegradable, nontoxic, and biocompatible properties. Pilot studies established PGA to be nonimmunogenic and well tolerated, even at high doses. Moreover, nanoparticles composed of PGA have been shown to immobilize proteins, peptides, and other related chemicals onto their surfaces and/or interior bulk. 26,27 PGA has also been extensively evaluated in cancer chemotherapy and been implied at various stages of clinical trials. [28][29][30] Moreover, the development of PGA based nanoparticles involves simple and easy preparation protocol, making it a superb strategy for the encapsulation of AmB. AmB-bearing PGA nanoparticles prepared in-house were investigated for their physical characteristics, stability, safety (both in vitro and in vivo), and in vitro antifungal efficacy in comparison with two commonly used formula tions of AmB, ie, AmBisome and Fungizone.",

This solution was filter-sterilized and stored at -70\u00b0C. Prior to each assay, an aliquot of stock XTT was thawed, and menadione (10 mM prepared in acetone; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to obtain a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M. The solution was filter-sterilized using a 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filter (Millipore). The biofilms (developed as above) were then incubated in the presence of the different concentrations of AmB\u2212PGA formulation (final concentrations from 0.195 to 100 \u00b5g/mL) for 48 hours. After treatment with the AmB\u2212PGA formulation, 100 \u00b5L of XTT was added to each prewashed biofilm (to remove nonadhered cells). The plates were then incubated in the dark for up to 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. A colorimetric change in the XTT reduction assay, a direct correlation of the metabolic activity of the biofilm, was then measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at 450 nm and expressed as percent viability in comparison with control cells. Untreated biofilms containing RPMI 1640 medium were included as positive controls. AmB-D and AmB-L were also included in the study as controls. Wells without biofilms served as a blank. Four replicate biofilms were included for each experiment.",

            "text": "Despite a worldwide search during the last three decades for a broad-spectrum, nontoxic, and well tolerated antifungal drug, AmB remains an ideal therapeutic agent for patients with unidentified invasive fungal infections. In the present scenario, a cheap, nontoxic, effective, and highly stable delivery system for AmB is needed to address the limitations of its existing delivery systems. Investigators have employed different watersoluble polymers to develop encapsulated, conjugated AmBbased delivery systems, but have met with little success. [40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48] In some of the earlier efforts, polymers synergized the toxicity of AmB, 49 while in others the AmB was unable to retain the beneficial physicochemical properties associated with its liposomal form (AmB-L). 50 Although, AmB-cyclodextrin complexes showed improved water solubility, 49,51 they were found to be toxic to human red blood cells. 52,53 On the other hand, polyvinylpyrrolidone has been shown to complex AmB, but suffers from very low (0.249% w/w) AmB loading. 54 Polymeric micelle systems have also been developed; however, encapsulation in the polymeric micelles decreased the in vitro antifungal activity of the drug. 40 Moreover, these micelles have been shown to be unstable in the presence of serum due to disruption of their integrity, 55 resulting in rapid and near-complete release of core-loaded molecules from circulating micelles in an uncontrolled fashion. 56 Herein, we aimed to develop a stable, easy-to-prepare, nontoxic preparation of AmB with physicochemical characteristics comparable with those shown by AmB-L. Replacing the lipid moiety with a water-soluble homopolymer could reduce the costs and stability issues associated with the lipid components of AmB-L. In addition, an amphiphilic PGA-based delivery system may have some advantages, including biocompatibility, biodegradability, 27,57 negligible toxicity, and cytoplasmic delivery of the entrapped molecules. The homopolymer contains carboxylic groups that can form ionic complexes with a charged compound such as AmB. Furthermore, PGA has the potential to encapsulate or immobilize a variety of molecules. 26,27,57 For example, PGA has been used in clinical trials in the form of a covalently bound conjugate with paclitaxel (Opaxio, Cell Therapeutics, Seattle, WA, USA). 29,30 The low aqueous solubility of amphiphilic AmB (\ue02c1 \u00b5g/mL) 58 makes it a suitable candidate for association with an amphiphilic PGA homopolymer. The initial reaction of AmB with PGA was carried out in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide, a water-miscible organic solvent. Next, an aqueous solution of PVA (a base) was added followed by extensive dialysis against water. In high abundance of an aqueous environment, AmB can either choose to associate with the PGA polymer or can form precipitates. The amphiphilic nature of both AmB and the PGA polymer enables them to remain in association, resulting in spontaneous formation of nanoparticles. The base is added to increase the solubility of the PGA, which ensures that the polymer remains in solution. The nanoparticles show unusually high stability in the presence of PVA. 59,60 The simple and straightforward preparation protocol makes development of a AmB\u2212PGA formulation an excellent strategy. The AmB\u2212PGA formulation was found to be readily and rapidly soluble in water ( Table 1). The EE was found to be around 20.5% and 45% for the two polymers in the 20-40 kDa and 50-70 kDa molecular weight range, respectively (Table 1). Since high AmB loading (\ue02e40%) ensures applicability in the clinical setting, the PGA nanoparticle having a molecular weight of 50-70 kDa (with high complexation efficiency and aqueous solubility) was used in the subsequent studies.",

Generally, a high zeta potential (either positive or negative), more than 30 mV, maintains a stable system. 61,62 Extremely positive or negative zeta potential values cause larger repulsive forces; this repulsion between similarly charged particles prevents aggregation of the particles and thus ensures easy redispersion. 63,64 Thus, it can be said that AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles prepared using a 50-70 kDa molecular weight polymer are more stable than nanoparticles prepared with PGA having a molecular weight of 20-40 kDa ( Table 1).",

It has been reported that the monomeric form of AmB absorbs maximally at about 405-409 nm (\u03bb max ), 77 while soluble self-aggregates display an absorption with a \u03bb max of about 328-340 nm. 73 In higher order aggregates, the maximum absorption shifts to wavelengths lower than 322 nm. Nonetheless, the optimum aggregation state is not simple, and cannot be defined using a single measure.",

When AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles were suspended in water, shifting of \u03bb max toward a shorter wavelength was observed (ie, a hypsochromic effect), suggesting the presence of aggregated AmB. The principal absorption was found to be at around 345 nm, with AmB showing a minimal peak at 410 nm (Figure 2A). As AmB is known to exist in monomeric form in organic solvents, we also determined its absorption spectrum in dimethyl sulfoxide. AmB showed an absorption pattern characteristic of a heptaene chromophore, with the lowest peak at around 355 nm and the highest peak at 415 nm ( Figure 2B). The spectral modifications induced by aggregation may be represented by the ratio of absorbance at two different peaks (A 340 /A 410 ), ie, 340 nm (peak I) and 410 nm (peak IV). The degree of aggregation of AmB can be easily monitored using this ratio. 33 The higher the aggregation ratio, the lower the amount of monomeric AmB present. When the PGA nanoparticles were dispersed in water, this ratio was found to be 2.39, whereas when dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the solvent, this ratio decreased to 0.24.",

Interestingly, it has been shown that AmB exists in a highly aggregated form in both AmB-D and AmB-L formulations. However, in AmB-L, there is an hypsochromic (blue) shift of 7\u22129 nm at \u03bb max . 78 This shift could be attributed to the close association between AmB and the lipid bilayer in AmB-L. 79 Interaction of AmB with the PGA polymer in an aqueous environment results in formation of AmB aggregates that become entrapped inside the selfassembled PGA nanoparticles during their formation.",

AmB-D was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. Liver and renal function tests (Table 2) suggest that while AmB-D imparts significant toxicity to the host liver and kidney, the AmB\u2212PGA formulation was not toxic even at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight and did not significantly alter serum biochemical parameters for renal and hepatic function. There was no significant elevation in serum alanine transaminase levels, while aspartate transaminase levels were slightly elevated. However, animals treated with AmB-D exhibited significantly elevated levels of both alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Creatinine concentrations were within the normal range for mouse serum in the AmB\u2212PGA-treated groups, whereas mice treated with AmB-D showed relatively higher levels of creatinine ( Table 2). The AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticle was well tolerated by the experimental animals up to a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, with no signs of illness or loss of body weight (data not shown).",

As observed under light microscopy, features of the renal parenchyma from animals treated with the AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles ( Figure S1C) were very much comparable with those of healthy controls ( Figure S1D) as well as AmB-L ( Figure S1B). There were no changes in the normal morphology of the kidneys, which showed normal renal corpuscles in terms of glomerular mass, cellularity, and urinary space. Intact renal tubules with characteristic cell linings as well as interstitial space could be identified. Both the proximal and distal convoluted tubules appear normal in architecture. AmB-D showed toxic effects on the kidney, with varying degrees of tissue necrosis ( Figure S1A). These results are consistent with preclinical reports by other investigators that AmB-D is more toxic than AmB-L and ABLC (amphotericin B lipid complex) at the cellular level 86,87 and more toxic than AmB-L and AmB colloidal dispersion (Amphotec \u00ae ) in organs. 88,89 In vitro antifungal activity",

            "text": "Occasionally, the dimorphic C. albicans may opt for intracellular life cycle inside the macrophages in order to avoid antibody onslaught. This intracellular abode also offers protection against the circulating antibiotics. Taking this fact into consideration, we assessed the antifungal potential of AmB entrapped in PGA nanoparticles against macrophages harboring intracellular C. albicans. It should be noted that no complete eradication of C. albicans was observed up to a drug concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 7). Overall, AmB-L was found to be less effective for killing intracellular C. albicans than either of the formulations tested (ie AmB-PGA and AmB-D). At a dose of 5 \u00b5g/mL, AmB-D showed higher intracellular antifungal activity than AmB-L (log 2.5 versus log 3.9, respectively). For AmB-D, doses higher than 10 \u00b5g/ mL were not studied because of their detrimental effects toward the host cell. The antifungal activity of AmB\u2212PGA was comparable with that of AmB-D (log 1.6 versus log 1.5, respectively) at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL AmB equivalent; with a log 2 decrease in CFU (Figure 7). A further increase in AmB dose (to 50 \u00b5g/mL) caused a 1 log decrease in CFU. The reduced toxicity of AmB following liposomal encapsulation (ie, AmBisome) seemed to be associated with a substantial reduction of its direct antifungal activity.    Low antifungal activity of AmB-L against intracellular C. albicans has also been reported by other investigators. 37 This may be accounted for by the low uptake of AmBisome (demonstrated in the J774 macrophage-like cell line) in comparison with other lipid based AmB formulations. 90 A higher level of uptake of AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles than of AmBisome in murine peritoneal macrophages and RAW 264.7 cells (our unpublished data) seems to be responsible for the observed high antifungal activity of the AmB\u2212PGA formulation. The particulate nature of PGA nanoparticles allows them to be efficiently taken up by these cells, giving rise to a higher concentration of drug. Simultaneous endocytosis of the AmB\u2212PGA complex and C. albicans brings them into close proximity, which favors more pronounced killing, presumably by apoptosis of target cells. 91 regression of C. albicans biofilm induced by amB-Pga",

            "text": "In order to determine the potential of AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles to interfere with formation of C. albicans biofilm, we studied their antibiofilm activity. Preliminary experiments on the antibiofilm activity of the nanoparticles were performed using phase contrast microscopy. Surprisingly, the AmB\u2212PGA formulation prevented formation of biofilm to a considerable extent ( Figure S2). This effect was unexpected, given the fact that the AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles would only reduce cell growth and not completely inhibit it. These encouraging results prompted us to examine its antibiofilm activity employing SEM and XTT studies. SEM studies revealed that complete eradication of the biofilms was not achieved by treatment with AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles, and fungal cells adhering to the biomaterial were still visible (Figure 8). However, compared with control (untreated) biofilms, AmB\u2212PGA-treated biofilms were less hyphal and some of the cells within the biofilms showed aberrant morphology. The XTT assay was also performed to quantitatively assess the potential of the AmB\u2212PGA formulation to inhibit C. albicans biofilm (Figure 9). Substantial inhibition of biofilm growth was observed upon exposure to the AmB\u2212PGA formulation. The AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles  showed concentration-dependent activity on C. albicans biofilm. Approximately 30%-35% of viable biofilm was observed in fully developed film at a concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ mL. AmB-L was the least effective against Candida biofilm, with a higher cell survival percentage (55.0%\u00b12.8%). On the other hand, AmB-D showed viability of 43.5%\u00b12.4% (Figure 9). The antifungal susceptibility of C. albicans biofilm was tested using highly developed biofilms of intermediate phase (24 hours) and maturation phase (48 hours). 92 All three antifungal formulations (AmB-D, AmB-L, and AmB\u2212PGA) were found to be more effective against 24-hour biofilm than 48-hour biofilm. AmB\u2212PGA nanoparticles demonstrated slightly higher activity than AmB-D for both 24-hour and 48-hour biofilm ( Figure S3), with AmB-L being the least effective. Despite the improved activity of the AmB\u2212PGA formulation, complete eradication of sessile organisms within mature biofilms was not observed ( Figure S3). For 24-hour preformed biofilm, AmB\u2212PGA reduced the optical density of the biofilm by 50% (P\ue02c0.001) after 4 hours of incubation time. In the case of 48-hour biofilm, the AmB\u2212PGA formulation achieved a 50% reduction in biofilm only after 24 hours. This decrease in antibiofilm activity as the biofilm matures is a common phenomenon with antifungal agents. 92 Similar results were obtained for AmB-D.",

            "text": "Consistent with our results (Figures 9 and S3), other researchers have shown that the antifungal killing effects of AmB against biofilms is generally more pronounced at the highest concentration (64 \u00b5g/mL) but not at therapeutic concentrations (0.125 and 0.5 \u00b5g/mL). 93 Researchers have observed that 20 times the MIC of commonly used antifungals was required to achieve a significant reduction in cell numbers. 94 Thus, higher levels of AmB-D are required to manage biofilm-related infection in the clinic, and this is not advisable because of the toxic behavior of AmB. We have shown here that our AmB\u2212PGA formulation prepared in-house is well tolerated even at high concentration and has little or no toxicity (Figures 4 and 5, Table 2). Therefore, it can be said that this AmB\u2212PGA formulation represents a good alternative to improve the management of Candida biofilm-associated infection, to disrupt biofilms, and to prevent the emergence of resistance.",

The mechanism behind the unique antibiofilm activity of our formulation prepared in-house is unknown. Given the size of the formulation, it is somewhat surprising that it can penetrate the extracellular matrix to target fungal cells; however, it can be speculated that the dispersion of AmB in the polymer may in fact facilitate passage through the charged polysaccharide extracellular matrix.",
