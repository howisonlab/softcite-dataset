            "text": "Morphogenesis of a columnar epithelium from cuboidal precursors involves the expansion of the lateral membrane. In contrast, formation of squamous epithelia requires shrinking of the lateral membrane and expansion of the apical and basal membranes. It is unclear how these changes in membrane size and cell shape are regulated. Previous studies suggest roles for cell junctions and the cytoskeleton. It has been shown that the reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is involved in the stretching of the Drosophila amnioserosa (Pope and Harris, 2008). A potential role of actin-Myosin-based contractility in preventing cell stretching can be deduced from data in the Drosophila follicular epithelium, where cells lacking Myosin function undergo a transition from a cuboidal to squamous cell shape (Wang and Riechmann, 2007). The same phenotype was observed when the function of adherens junctions is disturbed (M\u00fcller, 2000;Tanentzapf et al., 2000). The finding that compromised cell adhesion results in cell flattening suggests that squamous cell morphogenesis can be induced by reducing adhesion between cells. This raises the possibility that epithelial cells control the size of their lateral membrane by regulating the abundance or localization of cell adhesion molecules. An increase in the number of adhesion molecules could lead to an expansion of the lateral membrane, whereas their reduction allows membrane shrinking.",

            "text": "Two important protein families mediating cell adhesion are cadherins and immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules. A prominent member of the latter family is N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) and its insect homologue Fas2 (Fasciclin 2), which mediate homophilic interactions in the R egulation of epithelial cell shape, for example, changes in relative sizes of apical, basal, and lateral membranes, is a key mechanism driving morphogenesis. However, it is unclear how epithelial cells control the size of their membranes. In the epithelium of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, cuboidal precursor cells transform into a squamous epithelium through a process that involves lateral membrane shortening coupled to apical membrane extension. In this paper, we report a mutation in the gene Tao, which resulted in the loss of this cuboidal to squamous transition. We show that the inability of Tao mutant cells to shorten their membranes was caused by the accumulation of the cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 2, the Drosophila N-CAM (neural cell adhesion molecule) homologue. Fasciclin 2 accumulation at the lateral membrane of Tao mutant cells prevented membrane shrinking and thereby inhibited morphogenesis. In wild-type cells, Tao initiated morphogenesis by promoting Fasciclin 2 endocytosis at the lateral membrane. Thus, we identify here a mechanism controlling the morphogenesis of a squamous epithelium.",

Two recent studies show that Tao is also involved in growth regulation of imaginal discs, in which Tao activates the Salvador-Warts-Hippo (SWH) pathway by phosphorylating Hippo kinase (Boggiano et al., 2011;Poon et al., 2011). Here, we report the generation of a Tao allele lacking kinase activity, which allowed us to study a new function of Tao in regulating morphogenesis of the follicular epithelium. Tao reduces lateral adhesion between epithelial cells by promoting Fas2 endocytosis. Decreased cell adhesion permits shrinking of the lateral membrane and initiates the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium.",

To identify a possible function of Tao during Drosophila oogenesis, we performed an ethane methyl sulfonate (EMS) screen, in which we generated one chromosome with a point mutation in the second exon of the Tao gene (Tao eta ), resulting in a premature stop codon at aa 64. The predicted protein harbors only a 37-aa fragment of the kinase domain lacking its active site. As homozygous Tao eta mutants are lethal, we recombined the mutation onto a FLP recombination target (FRT) chromosome to generate genetic mosaics with the FRT/FLP technique (Xu and Rubin, 1993). Par-1 controls the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis of the oocyte by polarizing the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is necessary for the localization of Oskar to the posterior pole of the oocyte (Shulman et al., 2000;Tomancak et al., 2000). Surprisingly, neither Oskar localization nor microtubule polarity is affected in Tao mutant oocytes, indicating that Tao is not necessary for establishment of anterior-posterior polarity (Fig. S2 A).",

Posterior clones show milder morphological defects, which are reflected by an increase in the length of the lateral membrane compared with wild-type cells ( Fig. 1 A, right clone). To test whether Tao eta behaves as a lossof-function allele, we generated a chromosome with a small deletion that uncovers the entire open reading frame of Tao and two neighboring genes (see Materials and methods).

This organ is composed of follicles of different ages, which are subdivided into 14 different developmental stages (Horne-Badovinac and Bilder, 2005). Follicles or egg chambers consist of an inner cyst of germline cells (made of 15 nurse cells and one oocyte) surrounded by a monolayered follicular epithelium with initially cuboidal-shaped cells (Fig. S1 A). During early oogenesis, the germline cyst grows in size, leading to a volume increase that is accommodated by cell divisions in the epithelium. This changes after stage 6 when cell divisions cease because of the expression of Delta in the germline activating Notch signaling in the epithelium (Deng et al., 2001;L\u00f3pez-Schier and St Johnston, 2001). Although the germline cyst continues to increase its volume after stage 6, the epithelium undergoes morphogenesis and subdivides into an anterior squamous and a posterior columnar part ( Fig. S1 B). As a result, egg chambers develop with a posterior columnar epithelium covering the oocyte and an anterior squamous epithelium consisting of large and flat cells covering the nurse cells.",

            "text": "Morphometric analysis and mechanical modeling suggest that the growth of the inner cyst is a critical force for the morphogenesis of the squamous epithelium. Kolahi et al. (2009) propose a model in which the volume increase of the inner cyst exerts a tensile force on the outer epithelium inducing flattening of cells specifically in anterior epithelium. In the posterior epithelium, this force is counteracted by the apical actin cytoskeleton, which is organized by \ue062-Spectrin and contracted by Myosin (Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999;Wang and Riechmann, 2007). Anterior cells are unable to counteract cyst pressure and flatten. A possible reason for their inability to resist pressure is the locally restricted disassembly of their adherens junctions at positions where three or four cells meet (Grammont, 2007). As the adherens junctions anchor the actin cytoskeleton, their local breakdown could destabilize the apical actin network and trigger cell flattening (Kolahi et al., 2009). Adherens junction disassembly proceeds from anterior to the middle region of the follicle concomitant with stretching, suggesting a critical role for squamous cell morphogenesis (Grammont, 2007). It has been shown that Notch signaling is required for adherens junction breakdown during stretching (Grammont, 2007), but other genes contributing to epithelial stretching are unknown. Here, we identify the gene Tao as a critical regulator for squamous cell morphogenesis.",

This is in contrast to the mean value of 1.2 measured in egg chambers, in which Tao mutant clones and Fas2 knockdown have been induced. Thus, a reduction of Fas2 protein levels suppresses the morphogenetic defects of Tao mutant cells. Interestingly, Fas2 knockdown in Tao mutant cells suppresses not only the morphological defects but also the overaccumulation of Arm at the membrane (Fig. 2 D). As no other gene knockdown in our candidate approach was able to suppress Tao defects, we conclude that the overaccumulation of Fas2 protein in Tao cells is a major reason for their inability to undergo morphogenesis.",

However, we could recover small clones in stage 8/9 egg chambers, which all stretch normally (n = 8; Fig. 2, I and J). Moreover, double mutant clones accumulate normal Arm protein levels at their membranes, indicating a complete rescue of the Tao phenotype.

            "text": "The transmembrane protein Fas2 harbors five immunoglobulin domains, which mediate homophilic cell adhesion between the lateral membranes of follicle cells (Szafranski and Goode, 2004). The homophilic adhesion properties of Fas2 suggest a simple explanation for the stretching failure of Tao mutant cells: the increased accumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane results in increased cell-cell adhesion, which prevents membrane shrinking and hence morphogenesis. As this hypothesis implies that Fas2 is lost from the lateral membrane before stretching, we reexamined Fas2 localization during morphogenesis. It has been reported that the Fas2 protein is absent from anterior follicle cells at stage 8 (Szafranski and Goode, 2004). Our analysis of the temporal changes in Fas2 localization showed that anterior epithelial cells loose Fas2 when they are still cuboidal, indicating that down-regulation precedes stretching (Fig. 3 B). This supports the idea that Fas2 has to be removed from the lateral membrane to allow stretching. Fas2 is no longer detectable in stretching follicle cells (Fig. 3, C-D\ue039), whereas DE-cadherin forms a zonula adherens ( Fig. 3 D, red channel). This suggests that cell adhesion in stretching cells is mainly mediated by DE-cadherin. In contrast to the anterior cells, posterior cells maintain Fas2 at their microtubules between wild-type and Tao mutant cells. Neither the density of \ue061-Tubulin-stained microtubules nor microtubule polarity revealed by the localization of \ue067-Tubulin, Nod-lacZ, and Kinesin-lacZ is affected in Tao mutant cells ( Fig. S3, A-D). Moreover, Tao mutant cells do not show significant differences in the distribution of F-actin, \ue061-Spectrin, and Myosin activity, indicating that Tao does not act on the actin cytoskeleton (Fig. S3, E and F). We therefore conclude that Tao does not regulate morphogenesis via the cytoskeleton.",

Tao mutant follicle cells localize all aforementioned proteins correctly, indicating that the overall apicobasal polarity of the follicular epithelium is not affected (Fig. 1, E-H). Analysis of the adherens junction components DE-cadherin and \ue062-Catenin/Armadillo (Arm) revealed that they are present in the apicolateral region of the epithelium but accumulate at higher levels compared with neighboring wild-type cells (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). Moreover, their localization is not restricted to the apicolateral region but spreads into the apical membrane domain of Tao mutant cells. The apical marker Crb, Par-6, and aPKC also accumulate at higher levels but are still restricted to their domain (Fig. 1, E and F). Among the lateral markers, only Fas2 shows an increased membrane accumulation, whereas we detected no obvious difference in Dlg and Coracle levels ( Fig. 1, E, G, and H). Thus, although Tao is not essential for the establishment of membrane polarity, it regulates the accumulation proteins at the plasma membrane.",

To identify possible mediators of the defects, we performed a candidate in vivo RNAi interaction screen. We generated Tao mutant cell clones, in which candidate proteins are knocked down by inducing UAS-RNAi and UAS-Flippase transgenes with the same Gal4 driver line (see Materials and methods). In this screen, we included not only proteins that accumulate in Tao mutant cells but also other possible Taointeracting genes, such as par-1 and Eb1 (encoding a microtubule plus end-binding protein), and genes encoding members of the SWH pathway (Table S1). Fig. 2 compares the results for the interaction of Tao with genes encoding the transmembrane proteins Crb, DE-cadherin, and Fas2 as examples. Among the 10 genes tested in this approach, only Fas2 RNAi rescues Tao morphogenesis defects. In approximately half of the analyzed stage 9 egg chambers, the stretching defects of Tao mutant cell clones (n = 16) were clearly suppressed when Fas2 function was simultaneously reduced by RNAi. Analysis of Fas2 expression in this experiment revealed residual protein after RNAi, indicating an incomplete shrinking. Thus, timely controlled removal of Fas2 is critical for stretching of the anterior follicle cells.",

Fas2 overexpression delays stretching and results in the formation of elongated egg chambers, in which anterior follicle cells retain a cuboidal cell shape at stage 9 ( Fig. 3 E). Interestingly, these cell shape defects are accompanied by increased levels of the adherens junction component Arm at the apical membrane closely resembling Tao mutant cells (Figs. 3 E and 2 A, compare insets). Thus, Fas2 overexpression mimics the Tao phenotype, strongly supporting the hypothesis that increased Fas2 levels cause the defects of Tao mutant cells. In summary, our data show that Fas2 is lost from anterior follicle cells before they undergo stretching and that prolonged Fas2 expression interferes with lateral membrane shows an optical confocal section at the level of the zonula adherens, revealing the onset of stretching in the anterior-most cells. Arm overaccumulation is suppressed.

This analysis revealed a continuous increase in the number of Fas2 vesicles between stages 6 and 8 (Fig. 4 D). Moreover, the total number of Fas2-Rab5-positive vesicles per cell increases strongly during this period (Fig. 4 E). Similarly, the proportion of Fas2-Rab5 vesicles in relation to the total number of Rab5 vesicles rises from 3 to 13%, suggesting that an increasing part of the endocytic machinery is engaged in the internalization of Fas2 before stretching occurs (Table S3).

This analysis showed many Fas2 puncta that colocalize with one of the two Rab proteins, indicating that Fas2 is endocytosed and recycled at the membrane (Fig. 4, B and C).

            "text": "To further characterize the endocytosis defect in Tao mutants, we quantified the formation of Rab5-positive Fas2 vesicles in homozygous mutant and heterozygous cells. To this end, we recombined the Fas2 exon trap GFP insertion with the Tao eta mutation. To mark cell clones independently of GFP, we generated a P(neoFRT)19A chromosome with a follicle cell-specific enhancer trap, enabling us to detect follicle cell nuclei that are wild type for Tao with \ue062-Galactosidase (M\u00fcller, 2000). Using these chromosomes, we generated cell clones colabeled for Fas2-GFP and Rab5 and quantified confocal pictures by counting the number of Rab5 vesicles, vesicular Fas2 structures, and their colocalization. Moreover, we determined the subcellular localization of vesicular Fas2-Rab5 structures described for mutants that affect vesicle scission and endocytosis in the epithelium of the Drosophila notum (Georgiou et al., 2008;Leibfried et al., 2008). To test whether Tao is required for endocytosis, we performed uptake experiments, in which we incubated mosaic egg chambers with fluorescently labeled dextran. Quantification of dextran vesicle numbers in confocal pictures revealed that dextran internalization is significantly reduced in Tao mutant cells compared with neighboring heterozygous cells (Fig. 5 B). We also tested whether this approach monitors Fas2 endocytosis by staining ovaries after dextran incubation with an anti-Fas2 antibody. Notably, many dextran vesicles were Fas2 positive in wild-type cells, indicating that dextran was included in Fas2 endocytotic vesicles ( Fig. 5 D, arrowheads). In Tao mutant cells, the number of dextran vesicles colocalizing with Fas2 is strongly reduced, by distinguishing between cytoplasmic puncta (Fig. 5 E, arrowheads) and semicircular or tubular structures associated with the plasma membrane ( Fig. 5 E, arrows). This analysis revealed that in Tao mutant cells, plasma membrane-associated Fas2-Rab5 structures were increased, whereas Fas2-Rab5 vesicles in the cytoplasm were reduced ( Table 1). The increased accumulation of Fas2-Rab5 structures at the plasma membrane suggests that formation or scission of endocytic Fas2 vesicles is impaired in Tao mutant cells. Moreover, it is possible that Tao predominantly affects the formation of endocytotic Fas2 vesicles, as the spatial distribution of other (Fas2 negative) Rab5 vesicles was not affected in Tao mutant cells. Collectively, these results suggest that Tao activates Fas2 endocytosis by promoting the formation of Rab5 vesicles.",

In this process, Tao initiates morphogenesis by promoting Fas2 endocytosis from the lateral membrane, which reduces adhesive forces and thereby provides plasticity for the cuboidal to squamous cell shape change.

Similarly, we found no evidence that Tao regulates cell stretching via the cytoskeleton. Moreover, our results argue against a role for Tao in transcriptional repression of Fas2, indicating a function in posttranslational regulation. Indeed, our quantitative analysis of Fas2 vesicles in wild-type follicles indicates that membrane shrinking is initiated by enhanced endocytosis. Tao mutant cells have a reduced ability to internalize Fas2 vesicles, contain tubular Fas2 structures typical for endocytosis defects, and show fewer endocytotic Fas2 vesicles in the cytoplasm. This indicates that the overaccumulation of Fas2 at the lateral membrane is caused by defective Fas2 internalization, suggesting a role for Tao in promoting endocytosis at the lateral membrane. A similar function of Tao in triggering endocytosis of homophilic adhesion proteins has been identified in cultured hippocampal neurons (Yasuda et al., 2007). In contrast to the follicular epithelium, however, Tao is acting via the p38 MAP signaling pathway in this cell type.",

We therefore propose that the accumulation of Arm, DE-cadherin, and apical proteins in Tao mutant cells is not caused by impaired endocytosis but a result of the inability of these cells to increase their surface area. Consistent with this, we found that cells whose stretching is prevented by Fas2 overexpression (and which are wild type for Tao function) also concentrate Arm within their restricted apical surface (Fig. 3 E). A membrane domain-specific endocytosis function for Tao is also supported by experiments, which deplete Fas2 in Tao mutant cells. If Tao would act all along the plasma membrane, Fas2 removal from the lateral membrane should selectively rescue the lateral defect (i.e., Fas2 accumulation) but should not suppress the accumulation of apical and apicolateral proteins (e.g., Arm). However, Fas2 Tao double mutant cells do suppress Arm accumulation (Fig. 2 J). Thus, the primary defect of Tao mutants is Fas2 accumulation, which prevents stretching and expansion of the apical surface. The concentration of Arm is only a secondary effect of the cell shape defect.",

Before morphogenesis, all epithelial cells are cuboidal and adhere apicolaterally via DE-cadherin and more basolaterally via Fas2 interactions. In this period, Fas2 is endocytosed and recycled back to the membrane (Fig. 6, stage 6). Morphogenesis is primed by the Tao kinase, which promotes the endocytosis of Fas2 vesicles. We assume that a large proportion of the Fas2 vesicles enter the lysosomal pathway, leading to Fas2 degradation (Fig. 6, stage 8). The removal of Fas2 from the lateral membrane is a critical first step, which allows morphogenesis to occur. Once Fas2 has disappeared, the cuboidal shape of the epithelial cells is solely stabilized by the zonula adherens. Cell flattening requires a tensile force, and morphometric analysis indicates that this force originates from the continuously growing germline cyst, which stretches cells in the anterior epithelium (Fig. 6, stage 9; Kolahi et al., 2009). Flattening correlates well with the local breakdown of the zonula adherens, suggesting an important role for adherens junctions remodeling in cell stretching (Grammont, 2007). Although the exact molecular mechanism controlling remodeling has still to be elucidated, our data indicate that before cell stretching, lateral cell adhesion has to be reduced to provide morphogenetic plasticity to the lateral membrane.",

However, a similar scenario has been shown for the morphogenesis of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in Drosophila. Here, Fas2 has to be endocytosed in axons to allow glia cell migration. Despite this important function for Fas2 down-regulation, Fas2 mutants Using a HA fusion protein, we detected Tao protein at the lateral membrane and in the basolateral cytoplasm of the follicular epithelium. Interestingly, Tao protein accumulation appears as a gradient with the lowest levels in the apical and the highest levels in the basal region of the follicular epithelium (Fig. 1 I). As our rescue experiments demonstrate the functionality of the fusion protein, a gradient of endogenous Tao activity might also exist. This raises the possibility that Tao promotes endocytosis more strongly in basal regions of the lateral membrane. We speculate that there is a switch in Tao activity at the border between the lateral and the basal membrane and that the basal membrane domain is protected from Tao function. A spatial restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane could be achieved by the localization of a yet unidentified target of Tao kinase. Such a Tao mediator could exclusively localize to the lateral membrane.",

            "text": "The finding that not only Fas2 but also apical and apicolateral proteins, such as DE-cadherin and Crb, overaccumulate in Tao mutants might argue against a restriction of Tao function to the lateral membrane. However, in the light of the dramatic change in the geometry of stretching cells, an alternative explanation for the accumulation of these proteins seems more likely. Squamous cell morphogenesis involves a 15-fold surface expansion, which is accompanied by a strong increase in the amounts of proteins determining the apical membrane and forming the adherens junctions. Interestingly, also, posterior cells expand their surface, albeit in less dramatic manner (Kolahi et al., 2009). Tao mutant cells are unable to increase their surface area, but they nevertheless produce the same amount of apical and apicolateral bath for 1 h for a consecutive 3 d. After eclosion, females were kept at 27\u00b0C for 2-3 d and dissected. Alternatively, a UAS-FLP was induced in follicular epithelium using the GR1-Gal4 driver. To this end, flies were raised at 27\u00b0C and, after eclosion, shifted to 29\u00b0C for 28-48 h and dissected.",

To assess the interaction, the apical-basal cell length of both Tao eta + RNAi and RNAi only (or wild-type control) cells was measured at the level of the nuclei using the confocal microscope (LSM 700) software or ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). The apical-basal length proportion show no gross morphological defects in the PNS (Silies and Kl\u00e4mbt, 2010). Thus, although Fas2 down-regulation is critical for epithelial and PNS morphogenesis, both tissues can compensate for the complete loss of the protein. We propose that Fas2 helps to stabilize a morphological state and allows development to proceed only after its timely controlled endocytosis. This mechanism guarantees the correct timing of morphogenesis and thereby helps to coordinate the development of different cell types and tissues. In the follicular epithelium, Fas2 might collaborate with the zonula adherens in counteracting the pressure from the growing germline cyst. As a result, the cuboidal cell shape is stabilized and premature, and uncontrolled stretching is prevented. Subsequently, Fas2 internalization overcomes this control mechanism, and epithelial morphogenesis proceeds.",

This transposon neither affects viability nor fertility of the mutant flies. EP elements integrate UAS sequences into the genome, allowing the overexpression of adjacent genes by a Gal4 driver line. Induction of Tao expression by combining EP1455 with the ubiquitous driver Tubulin-Gal4 results in lethality. We used this lethal combination of chromosomes to screen for suppressor mutations. To this end, we fed males harboring the EP element with EMS and crossed them to females expressing the Tubulin-Gal4 driver. After screening of more than 10,000 crosses, we obtained 13 suppressors of lethality, which are good candidates to carry mutations in the Tao locus. Among those, one suppressor mutation was lethal by itself, which we named Tao eta . Sequence analysis revealed a point mutation in the kinase domain of Tao, in which a CAG triplet encoding glutamine (aa 64) is mutated to TAG, resulting in a stop codon.",

The statistical analysis of Fas2-GFP-Rab5 colocalization for the three categories, between Tao eta homozygous and Tao eta heterozygous cells, was performed with a t nonequal variance test. The criteria used to count a colocalization event as positive were that 50% or more of the Fas2 structure colocalized with Rab5 or Rab11.",

Subsequently, the ovaries were washed with 1 ml PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Staining procedures were performed as described in Antibodies and histology. To assess dextran-Fas2 colocalization, the Fas2 antibody was used at a 1:25 dilution. To quantify the dextran uptake in the Tao mutant genetic mosaics, the total number of dextran vesicles within the wild-type and Tao mutant clone was quantified and averaged by the number of cells analyzed within each clone. To quantify the dextran-Fas2 colocalization, the total number of dextran-Fas2-colocalizing vesicles was counted in the wild-type and mutant clones (only the cytoplasmic Fas2 signal was considered). The total number of dextran-Fas2 vesicles was averaged by the number of cells analyzed within each clone.
