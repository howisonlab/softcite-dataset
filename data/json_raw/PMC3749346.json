            "text": "In established obesity, inflammation and macrophage recruitment likely contribute to the development of insulin resistance. In the current study, we set out to explore whether adipose tissue infiltration by neutrophils that occurs early (3 days) after initiating a high-fat diet (HFD) could contribute to the early occurrence of hepatic insulin resistance and to determine the role of cytosolic phospholipase A 2 a (cPLA 2 a) in this process. The 3-day HFD caused a significant upregulation of cPLA 2 a in periepididymal fat and in the liver. A specific antisense oligonucleotide (AS) effectively prevented cPLA 2 a induction, neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue (likely involving MIP-2), and protected against 3-day HFD-induced impairment in hepatic insulin signaling and glucose over-production from pyruvate. To sort out the role of adipose neutrophil infiltration independent of cPLA 2 a induction in the liver, mice were injected intraperitoneally with anti-intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) antibodies. This effectively prevented neutrophil infiltration without affecting cPLA 2 a or MIP-2, but like AS, prevented impairment in hepatic insulin signaling, the enhanced pyruvate-to-glucose flux, and the impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production (assessed by clamp), which were induced by the 3-day HFD. Adipose tissue secretion of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) was increased by the 3-day HFD, but not if mice were treated with AS or ICAM-1 antibodies. Moreover, systemic TNF-a neutralization prevented 3-day HFD-induced hepatic insulin resistance, suggesting its mediatory role. We propose that an acute, cPLA 2 a-dependent, neutrophil-dominated inflammatory response of adipose tissue contributes to hepatic insulin resistance and glucose overproduction in the early adaptation to high-fat feeding. Diabetes 62:3053-3063, 2013 E stablished obesity, particularly if associated with insulin resistance-related morbidities, is characterized by systemic and adipose tissue inflammation (1)(2)(3). The complexity of the adipocytokines and inflammatory cell types involved in adipose inflammation is constantly increasing, and today, most myeloid cell types have been implicated in the process, including macrophages, B cells, various T-cell classes, and even eosinophils and mast cells (4)(5)(6). In contrast, much less is known about adipose tissue and liver adaptation to a short-term high-fat diet (HFD) before overt obesity is present. Metabolically, it appears that hepatic insulin resistance may be a front-line response to a short-term (3 days) HFD (7,8), representing \"physiological adaptation\" and/or an early maladaptive response on the causal pathway to obesity-induced whole-body insulin resistance. It currently remains unclear to what degree this early response to an HFD involves immune cells in general and, specifically, in adipose tissue.",

Adipose tissue protein levels of the neutrophil-specific myeloperoxidase (MPO) were increased, and correspondingly, histology detected an increased number of neutrophils within the parenchyma of adipose tissue (i.e., not restricted to blood vessels). This early appearance of neutrophils in adipose tissue was recently confirmed (10), suggesting that adipose tissue inflammation in obesity largely follows the classical inflammation paradigms of acute versus chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates, predominated first by neutrophils, then lymphocytes in the subacute period, and finally, by mononuclear macrophages when inflammation becomes chronic. Yet, the co-occurrence of increased adipose neutrophil infiltration (9,10) with the early hepatic insulin resistance (7,8) prompts the question of whether the former phenomenon is causative for the latter.",

It plays a major role in the stimulus-initiated production of eicosanoids (prostaglandins and the chemoattractant leukotrienes) and platelet activating factor (11). In a previous study, we demonstrated that cPLA 2 a is upregulated in vascular endothelial cells in adipose tissue of mice in response to the 3-day HFD and that it mediates the elevated expression of the endothelial intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) (12) that is used for adhesion by neutrophils and monocytes. In addition, cPLA 2 a has been demonstrated to regulate superoxide generation by NADPH oxidase activation (13), thus promoting phagocyte-induced oxidative stress. Intriguingly, in humans, even a single exposure to a high-fat meal induced NADPH activation and inflammatory cascades in circulating leukocytes (14)(15)(16). These findings suggest that cPLA 2 a could participate in priming/activation of circulating cells upstream in inflammatory cascades that ultimately lead to adipose tissue infiltration by neutrophils, way before obesity has developed. In the current study, we set out to reveal the role of cPLA 2 a and adipose tissue neutrophil infiltration in the acute adaptation to a 3-day HFD, with emphasis on whether these early inflammatory responses could underlie the development of hepatic insulin resistance.",

Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated by multiplying fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU/L) with fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) divided by 22.5 (25)(26)(27). Plasma insulin levels were determined by ELISA (ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH). Glucose clamp studies. Glucose clamp studies in freely moving mice were performed as described (28). Steady-state glucose infusion rate was calculated once glucose infusion reached a near-constant rate to maintain glucose at 5 mmol/L for 20 min. The glucose disposal rate was calculated by dividing the rate of [3-3 H]glucose infusion by the plasma [3-3 H]glucose-specific activity (29,30). Endogenous glucose production during the clamp was calculated by subtracting the glucose infusion rate from the glucose disposal rate (29,30). Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate was calculated by subtracting basal endogenous glucose production (equal to basal glucose disposal rate) from the glucose disposal rate during the clamp (31).

At different times after initiating the HFD, mice received an intravenous insulin injection 5 min before livers were harvested. Three days after initiating the HFD, hepatic insulin-stimulated Ser473-Akt phosphorylation was markedly attenuated ( Fig. 1A). At this time point of marked diminution of insulin signaling in the liver, adipose tissue exhibited normal insulin-stimulated Ser473-Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). Insulin resistance in this tissue required a longer duration of HFD to manifest (data not shown). Nevertheless, the 3-day HFD was already sufficient to induce a statistically significant increase in adipose tissue weight ( Fig. 1C) and a notable increase in adipocyte cell size ( Fig. 1D). As reported in a previous study (9), multiple neutrophils were visible between adipocytes, indicating infiltration of the tissue parenchyma. (Fig. 1D). Concomitantly, histologic analysis showed hepatic lipid content was notably mildly increased in mice fed the 3-day HFD (Fig.  1E), as were fasting glucose levels (Table 1). Calculated HOMA-IR values revealed systemic insulin resistance induced by the 3-day HFD (Table 1).",

This approach was based on previous findings demonstrating 1) the effectiveness of AS administration in inhibiting neutrophil recruitment to the site of inflammation (13) and 2) that the 3-day HFD induces cPLA 2 a upregulation in adipose tissue (12). Mice received an intravenous tail vein injection of 1 mg/kg AS, 1 mg/kg corresponding (control) sense oligonucleotide, or saline 1 day before and then daily during the 3-day HFD. Weight gain was not affected by the AS or sense treatments ( Fig. 2A), but AS treatment significantly prevented the elevated cPLA 2 a protein expression detected in lysates of adipose tissue of the 3-day HFD mice (Fig. 2B). The AS treatment also significantly prevented the recruitment of neutrophils to the adipose tissue of the HFD mice, as detected by adipose protein levels of MPO ( Fig. 2C) and by quantitation of neutrophils by NIMP-R14 immunostaining ( Fig. 2D).",

However, no difference was observed between IgG-and ICAM-treated mice ( Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. 1). Insulin-mediated inhibition of endogenous (mainly reflecting hepatic) glucose production was significantly reduced in IgG-treated HFD-fed mice (Fig. 4H). In contrast, ICAM-treated HFD-fed mice showed a conserved response to insulin, suggesting improved hepatic insulin sensitivity in ICAM-treated compared with IgG-treated HFD-fed mice (Fig. 4H). Of note, the 3-day HFD did not significantly affect the insulinstimulated glucose disposal rate (mainly reflecting skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity), although a slight decrease was apparent in the group treated with anti-ICAM-1 (Fig. 4I). High variability in the insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate may have prevented a significant difference in the glucose infusion rate between the two HFD-fed groups (Fig. 4G). These hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp results are consistent with a state of selective hepatic insulin resistance induced by the 3-day HFD, which can be alleviated by anti-ICAM-1 antibodies that prevent adipose tissue neutrophil infiltration.",

D and E: Representative immunoblots and densitometry of a mouse model of sterile peritonitis (13), and the neutrophilselective chemoattractant IL-8.

Epididymal fat tissue from 3-day HFD-fed mice and control (3-day LFD) mice expressed similar levels of 5-LOX protein and released similar levels of LTB 4 , with no effect on these parameters by AS treatment (Fig. 5B and C). Similarly, secretion of the neutrophil chemoattractant KC was not affect by 3-day HFD or by the AS treatment (Fig. 5D). Yet, a significantly increased secretion of MIP-2 from adipose tissue of the 3-day HFD mice was detected ( Fig. 5E and F). AS-treated 3-day HFD mice secreted significantly lower levels of MIP-2, similar to those of the control mice ( Fig. 5E), suggesting that cPLA 2 a is involved in regulation of MIP-2 production. In contrast, treatment of the 3-day HFD mice with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies did not attenuate MIP-2 secretion (Fig. 5F), suggesting that cPLA 2 a upregulation, but not the consequential neutrophil infiltration, is involved in adipose tissue MIP-2 production. Jointly, these findings suggest a putative role for adipose MIP-2 as a chemoattractant involved in neutrophil recruitment to the epididymal fat tissue early after initiating the HFD.",

Our studies reveal that: 1) Hepatic insulin resistance develops as early as 3 days after initiating an HFD, consistent with recently published studies (7,8). 2) Recruitment of neutrophils to adipose tissue is critical for the induction of hepatic insulin resistance in response to the 3-day HFD. Increased adipose tissue TNF-a secretion may constitute a mediator in this response, because increased TNFa secretion and hepatic insulin resistance were both prevented when neutrophil infiltration was attenuated, and neutralizing TNF-a significantly prevented hepatic insulin resistance.",

            "text": "Consistent with our previous (9) and present studies, recruitment of neutrophils to adipose tissue after 3 days of the HFD was recently confirmed by others (10), and the role of adipose tissue neutrophils in insulin resistance was also demonstrated. Adipose tissue recruitment of neutrophils is also consistent with a study demonstrating increased leukocyte-endothelial cells-platelet interaction in the microcirculation of visceral adipose tissue in obesity (39). Moreover, in humans, pregnant obese women with preeclampsia exhibited extensive vascular inflammation characterized predominantly by neutrophils, demonstrable in adipose tissue blood vessels (40). The current study, however, offers several novel observations and mechanistic insights: the 3-day HFD constitutes a unique state predominantly affecting hepatic insulin responsiveness, independent of skeletal muscle, and/or adipose tissue insulin resistance that apparently takes longer to develop. Under such conditions of \"isolated hepatic insulin resistance,\" we were able to demonstrate that neutrophil recruitment, specifically to adipose tissue (and not to the liver), is necessary for hepatic insulin resistance to develop. Moreover, induction of adipose cPLA 2 a upregulation is deemed necessary for adipose tissue neutrophil infiltration and is upstream of an inflammatory pathway involving the upregulation of the neutrophil chemoattractant MIP-2, the upregulation of the endothelial adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (12), and the adipose tissue neutrophil-dependent increased production of TNF-a. Importantly, although cPLA 2 a is upregulated also in the liver, as was neutrophil elastase in a recent study, (10) our results assign a role specifically for adipose, and not hepatic, cPLA 2 a upregulation in the induction of hepatic insulin resistance and glucose analyses of p-Akt (serine 473) and p-GSK (serine 9). For each group of mice, liver lysate of a mouse that was not treated with insulin (-) and lysates from two different mice treated with insulin (+) are presented.

We thus provide compelling evidence that adipose cPLA 2 a-mediated neutrophil infiltration, specifically to adipose tissue, contributes to hepatic insulin resistance in response to acute short-term high-fat feeding. It may be speculated that this early inflammatory response to a HFD, consistent with studies in human circulating leukocytes (14)(15)(16), represents, at least in the short-term, a physiological adaptation: isolated hepatic insulin resistance with preserved adipose tissue insulin sensitivity would assist in directing more storage of excess calories in adipose tissue and less in ectopic sites.",

These include CD11c + , M1-like macrophages (2,4,41,42), and B and CD8 + T cells (43)(44)(45). However, the recruitment of lymphocytes to adipose tissue was not directly linked with induction of insulin resistance (5). Although Kupffer cells were proposed to mediate the induction of hepatic insulin resistance by 3-day HFD 7, another study reported opposite results (8), suggesting that whereas macrophage-mediated tissue inflammation is a key component of chronic obesity-associated insulin resistance, it is not critical for the decrease in insulin sensitivity at the early adaptation to HFD feeding. We therefore propose that most likely, in the acute response to HFD, neutrophils may well constitute the major driver of adipose tissue inflammation and hepatic insulin resistance.",

In the current study, prevention of cPLA 2 a upregulation by AS treatment in the 3-day HFD mice did not interfere with weight gain. Thus, cPLA 2 a regulates the adaptation to the 3-day HFD independent of weight gain or adipocyte hypertrophy. The results of the current study suggest that MIP-2, a mouse ortholog of human IL-8, signals neutrophils recruitment downstream of cPLA 2 a (Fig. 6). This observation may also be highly relevant for humans in whom adipose tissue IL-8 levels were elevated (48-50). MIP-2 has been shown to be one of the major inducible chemokines with the ability to attract neutrophils to the site of inflammation (51). KC and MIP-2 have temporally distinct patterns of expression and cell type-specificity (52). MIP-2 was shown to be produced by resident macrophages and by neutrophils (36,51). Therefore, in response to the 3-day HFD, MIP-2 is likely produced by resident macrophages and not by neutrophils, because MIP-2 production was reduced only with the AS treatment and not with anti-ICAM-1 antibodies treatment, whereas in both treatments, the recruitment of neutrophils to the adipose fat was prevented. Because MIP-2 synthesis is Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent (36) and saturated free fatty acids act as a naturally occurring ligands of macrophage TLR4 (53), it is possible that elevation of free fatty acid in the intra-abdominal adipose tissue by the 3-day HFD triggers FIG. 5.

            "text": "We show here that circulating neutrophils are activated in mice fed the 3-day HFD, as shown by the release of superoxides (Fig. 5A). This is consistent with the immediate activation of circulating neutrophils, the release of superoxides, increased expression of NADPH oxidase, and the increased proinflammatory cytokines demonstrated in healthy human subjects exposed to a high-fat meal or a high-fat-carbohydrate meal or during a glucose challenge (14)(15)(16)(54)(55)(56)(57). The activated adipose neutrophil-produced factors that mediate hepatic insulin resistance have yet to be identified. Although neutrophil elastase is a likely candidate (10), it should be remembered that this was demonstrated at 12 weeks of the HFD, when its expression was also elevated in the liver. LTB 4 or PGE 2 were shown to impair insulin signaling (37,58), and adipose tissue LTB 4 secretion was recently reported to contribute to elevation of adipose macrophages and T cells at 15 weeks of an HFD (59). Yet, they are unlikely to be involved in the response to the 3-day HFD. Elevated local and circulating levels of FIG. 6. TNF-a is the possible adipose mediator for the induction of hepatic insulin resistance in response to short-term HFD. A: A representative immunoblot of COX-2 in adipose lysates of LFD mice, control HFD sense (SE)-treated mice, and AS-treated HFD mice. Densitometry analyses were performed as for cPLA 2 a in Fig. 2A. Release of PGE 2 (B) and IL-6 (C) from adipose tissue explants. No statistically significant differences among the groups were noted. D: TNF-a release from adipose tissue explants was significantly increased (*P < 0.001) in control HFD mice (SE) compared with HFD mice with AS treatment or LFD mice. E: TNF-a release from adipose tissue explants was significantly increased (*P < 0.001) in control HFD mice (open circles) and HFD mice with IgG treatment (down gray triangles) compared with HFD mice with anti-ICAM-1 treatment (up gray triangles) or LFD mice (filled circles). F and G: TNF-a neutralization prevented insulin resistance in the 3-day HFD liver. Representative immunoblots and densitometry analyses are shown for p-Akt (serine 473) and p-GSK (serine 9). For each group of mice, liver lysate of a mouse that was not treated with insulin (-) and lysates from two different mice treated with insulin (+) are presented. Densitometry analyses for p-Akt and p-GSK were performed as in Fig. 1A. *P < 0.001, significant decrease in control and IgG-treated HFD mice compared with TNF-a-depleted HFD mice or LFD mice. 3-day LFD (filled circles), 3-day HFD (open circles), 3-day HFD treated with anti-TNF antibodies (up gray triangles), and 3-day HFD treated with control IgG (down gray triangles). t, total.",

Although there was no increase in adipose secretion of IL-6 at the 3-day HFD, here we show that adipose tissue released significantly higher levels of TNF-a and that prevention of neutrophil infiltration to adipose tissue significantly attenuated this response. TNF-a blood levels were significantly elevated by the short-term HFD, consistent with a recent study (8), and neutralizing these elevated TNF-a levels prevented the development of hepatic insulin resistance by the 3-day HFD, further supporting its causal role in the process. In accordance with our results, a much higher increase in TNF-a than in IL-6 gene expression in adipose tissue at day 3 of the HFD was reported (8). We thus propose TNF-a as a potential mediator of primed adipose tissue neutrophils in causing hepatic insulin resistance induced by the 3-day HFD.",

Adipose cPLA 2 a has a major role in promoting infiltration of activated neutrophils to adipose tissue in a short-term HFD, probably by increasing the production of the neutrophil chemoattractant MIP-2 and upregulating ICAM-1. The presence of neutrophils in the adipose tissue induces elevated secretion of TNF-a, which likely contributes to the early development of isolated hepatic insulin resistance."
