            "text": "We have found that expression of \u03b3\u03b4T cells is increased in pathological mucosa of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) compared with normal nasal mucosa. This increase is correlated with the infiltration of eosinophils in CRSwNP. Here, we investigated the expression of \u03b3\u03b4T cells, inflammation and tissue remodeling factors as well as their probable relationships in different types of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in China. Methods: A total of 76 surgical tissue samples that included 43 CRSwNP samples (15 eosinophilic and 28 non-eosinophilic), 17 CRS samples without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and 16 controls were obtained. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells, V\u03b34 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), interleukin (IL)-8, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b22, metalloproteinase (MMP)-7, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-4 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the protein level of ECP and MMP-7 in CRSwNP. The eosinophils were counted and the level of edema was analyzed with HE staining. Results: The mRNA expression levels of the V\u03b31 subset, ECP and MMP-7 were significantly increased in CRSwNP with histological characteristics of eosinophilic infiltration and edema. The expression of the V\u03b31 gene in CRSwNP correlated positively with the expression of both ECP and MMP-7. No significant decreases in the mRNA expression levels of TGF-\u03b22, TIMP-4 or HIF-1\u03b1 were observed in the CRSwNP samples. The expression levels of V\u03b31 gene, ECP and MMP-7 were significantly increased in eosinophilic CRSwNP compared to non-eosinophilic CRSwNP. Conclusions: Our results suggest the associations between V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells, ECP and MMP-7 in CRSwNP, indicating that V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells can induce the eosinophilic inflammation, which has a further effect on the formation of edema.",

            "text": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common chronic diseases, with an estimated prevalence of 12% in the United States. 1 CRS has a substantial influence on the quality of life and is a burden to the social economy. 2 Clinically, there are 2 types of CRS: chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). These different types of CRS have distinct inflammatory features and tissue remodeling patterns. CRSsNP is characterized predominantly by a T-helper type 1 (Th1)-induced neutrophilic inflammation with elevated expressions of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs), which result in remodeling that includes excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, interstitial fibrosis, basement membrane thickening and goblet cell hyperplasia without obvious pseudocyst formation. 3 CRSwNP is featured by a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-skewed eosinophilic in-flammation that involves prominent edema formation and a decreased level of TGF-\u03b21, which lead to fibrosis and increased levels of metalloproteinases (MMPs), which in turn lead to pseudocyst formation. 3 According to the inflammatory pattern, CRSwNP is further divided into eosinophilic CRSwNP (Eos CRSwNP) and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP (non-Eos CRSwNP). There are differences between the two subtypes of CRSwNP.",

None of the enrolled patients had histories of surgery or the use of corticosteroids or antibiotics within the month prior to surgery. The nasal polyps (NPs), diseased ethmoid sinus mucosa or uncinate processes of the patients with CRS were collected during functional endonasal sinus surgery as the case group. The normal nasal mucosa of the inferior turbinate, ethmoid sinus or uncinate process were taken from the patients with deviations of the nasal septum, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea or traumatic optic neuropathy who presented with no sinus inflammation as the control group. All tissue samples were stored as duplicates at -80\u00b0C after rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen; one sample was used for quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the other was used for histological analysis.

Previous studies based on Caucasian patients have sug-gested that CRSwNP is primarily characterized by eosinophilic inflammation and edematous remodeling patterns. 2,25 However, this situation is different from that of Asian patients. Recently, a few studies based on Asians have shown that minor eosinophilic inflammation accounts for the distinctive features of CRSwNP. 16,26,27 Moreover, the expanding racial differences that have been reported indicate that Caucasian patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma are more common than Chinese patients with both conditions. 28 Studies have shown that the NP samples from Caucasians exhibit Th2-skewed and eosinophilic inflammation patterns, and NP samples from Chinese people exhibit both Th1/Th17 and Th2 cell patterns with neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation. 12,16,27 In the present study, the CRSwNP samples from Chinese patients also exhibited similar characteristics and a greater proportion of noneosinophilic inflammatory patterns. Moreover, it is noteworthy that evidence indicates that \u03b3\u03b4T cells participate in Th2 immune responses. In contrast, the available data suggest that a small fraction of \u03b3\u03b4T cells act as effective suppressors. 10,29,30 Taken together, distinct subsets of \u03b3\u03b4T cells likely produce certain cytokines that induce the infiltration of different inflammatory cells, such as eosinophils and neutrophils. However, the functions and capacities are not yet clear.",

            "text": "Correspondingly, our previous reports proved that \u03b3\u03b4T cell numbers are increased in CRSwNP pathological mucosa and positively correlated with the infiltration of eosinophils. The V\u03b31 gene expression is also increased in CRSwNP pathological mucosa. 9 A study conducted by Hahn et al. 10 demonstrated similar results; these authors found that V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells appeared to strongly enhance AHR and airway inflammation, whereas V\u03b34 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells unambiguously suppressed AHR. The mRNA expression of V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells was proven to positively correlate with that of ECP in CRSwNP in the present study, but the expression of V\u03b34 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells was not found to be negatively correlated with either ECP or eosinophils. Again, these findings support the hypothesis that distinct subsets of \u03b3\u03b4T cells can be inhibitors or enhancers depending on the specific \u03b3 and \u03b4 TCR chains. Additional support for this notion is provided by the increasing \u03b3\u03b4T cells are correlated with ECP and MMP-7 in CRSwNP number of studies based on murine models or humans that suggest that \u03b3\u03b4T cells mediate inflammatory cell infiltration and remodeling in many diseases, such as liver inflammation and fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, lung inflammation, asthma, allergic rhinitis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. 5,6,24,31,32 However, studies of the relationships of \u03b3\u03b4T cells, inflammation and remodeling in CRS are scarce. Hence, additional observations and data are needed to address this question. Tissue remodeling is a dynamic process that is closely related to the extracellular matrix (ECM). If the balance between the formation and degradation of the ECM is disrupted, the rebuilding process occurs. When the body is attacked by exogenous or endogenous stimulation, the immune system promotes the accumulation and production of inflammatory cells including eosinophils, which are activated to release a variety of proteins and cytokines, including ECP, TGF-\u03b2, MMPs, TIMPs and ILs. Eosinophils and ECP have been clearly suggested to initiate the formation of edema. Flood-Page et al. 33 showed that anti-IL-5 treatment reduces eosinophils and fibrosis in the airways of asthmatics. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 has been indicated to be a key regulator of ECM production and tissue remodeling, whereas MMPs are known to be important regulators of the degradation of the ECM. Matrilysin MMP-7 is upregulated, which disturbs the tissue homeostasis and progresses to the formation of edema. TIMPs act as inhibitors of MMPs. Finally, all of these confounding and multiple regulators may ultimately contribute to tissue remodeling. 3,34 Eosinophilic inflammation with the index by ECP can lead to the downregulation of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22, and the decreased expression of TIMP-4. Without the inhibitor of MMPs, the activity of MMP-7 and MMP-9 increased, which promoting degradation of ECM and formation of edema. 3,12,35 And vice versa, neutrophilic inflammatory may release IL-8 and lead to the increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and TGF-\u03b22, as well as TIMP-4, which finally result in the deposition of collagen and fibrosis. 3,35 Moreover, studies have shown that under anoxic conditions, HIF-1\u03b1 distributed in the airway of patients can be activated and lead to epithelialto-mesenchymal transition. 36 The current study revealed that the general histological features of CRSwNP are characterized by correlated edema and eosinophil infiltration, with the increased expressions of V\u03b31 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells, ECP, and MMP-7, and a positive correlation between the two. No significant difference in the expressions of V\u03b34 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells was observed in the different groups. As previously mentioned, V\u03b34 mRNA expression should have decreased. The failure to observe this phenomenon might have been due to the patients themselves or the progression of chronic disease. In long-term CRS, the body has defended against the course of disease and has received some treatment. Furthermore, no significant increases in the mRNA expression levels of TGF-\u03b22, TIMP-4 or HIF-1\u03b1 were found in the CRSsNP samples in this study, and these results are inconsistent with the results of oth-er studies. 3,35 Because the mRNA expression levels of these regulators in mucosa are minimal, and the majority of the CRSwNP samples belonged in the non-eosinophilic subset, there were no substantial differences between the CRSwNP and CRSsNP groups.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that \u03b3\u03b4T cells are activated in the presence of pathogens, antigens and stimulation by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) because macrophages promote NF-\u03baB signaling that results in the release of IL-23, which is recognized by the corresponding receptor IL-23R of the \u03b3\u03b4T cells and activates nuclear translocator ROR\u03b3t to produce IL-17A. This process leads to inflammatory cell infiltration or recruitment, which eventually causes edema or fibrosis. 5,6,37 IL-17A has been suggested to induce MMPs secretion. 36 Several studies have demonstrated that IL-17A upregulates Th2 cellmediated eosinophilic airway inflammation and plays an important role in the remodeling of nasal polyps. 37,38 Additional evidence found in our previous study indicated that the expression of IL-17A is upregulated in CRSwNP. However, the role and the related mechanisms of IL-17A in remodeling have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, all of the current studies have demonstrated the potential significant mechanism by which \u03b3\u03b4T cells are related to inflammation and remodeling in CRS. In addition to benefiting scientific research, these findings provide another pathway for the management and intervention for CRS patients. However, the mechanisms underlying IL-17A production and the roles of IL-17A in inflammation and the early damage and remodeling of the mucosa in CRS remain unclear.",
