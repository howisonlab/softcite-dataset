            "text": "Background: The rate of entry of cocaine into the brain is a critical factor that influences neuronal plasticity and the development of cocaine addiction. Until now, passive diffusion has been considered the unique mechanism known by which cocaine crosses the blood-brain barrier. Methods: We reassessed mechanisms of transport of cocaine at the blood-brain barrier using a human cerebral capillary endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) and in situ mouse carotid perfusion. Results: Both in vivo and in vitro cocaine transport studies demonstrated the coexistence of a carrier-mediated process with passive diffusion. At pharmacological exposure level, passive diffusion of cocaine accounted for only 22.5% of the total cocaine influx in mice and 5.9% in hCMEC/D3 cells, whereas the carrier-mediated influx rate was 3.4 times greater than its passive diffusion rate in vivo. The functional identification of this carrier-mediated transport demonstrated the involvement of a proton antiporter that shared the properties of the previously characterized clonidine and nicotine transporter. The functionnal characterization suggests that the solute carrier (SLC) transporters Oct (Slc22a1-3), Mate (Slc47a1) and Octn (Slc22a4-5) are not involved in the cocaine transport in vivo and in vitro. Diphenhydramine, heroin, tramadol, cocaethylene, and norcocaine all strongly inhibited cocaine transport, unlike benzoylecgonine. Trans-stimulation studies indicated that diphenhydramine, nicotine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (ecstasy) and the cathinone compound 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) were also substrates of the cocaine transporter. Conclusions: Cocaine transport at the BBB involves a proton-antiporter flux that is quantitatively much more important than its passive diffusion. The molecular identification and characterization of this transporter will provide new tools to understand its role in addictive mechanisms.",

            "text": "Cocaine is a psychoactive drug that acts predominantly as an inhibitor of solute carrier family (SLC)6A3, also known as the dopamine transporter (DAT), and is involved in dopamine uptake at the synaptic cleft. This inhibition is considered to be the main contributor to the reinforcement and behavioral properties of cocaine (Volkow et al., 1997b). Cocaine has been shown to be more addictive when smoked (crack use) or intravenously injected compared with nasal inhalation (or snorting) (Gossop et al., 1992;Cone, 1995). Neurobehavioral and molecular studies have demonstrated the critical role of the rate of cocaine delivery to the brain in the neuronal plasticity and reward effects induced by cocaine (Samaha et al., 2004;Samaha and Robinson, 2005;Volkow et al., 2012;Minogianis et al., 2013). Increasing the rapidity of cocaine administration leads to an increase of its abuse liability (Volkow et al., 2000;Abreu et al., 2001;Samaha et al., 2004). Variability in the rate of brain cocaine uptake may thus have significant consequences on its acute and chronic effects in the central nervous system (CNS).",

            "text": "The rate at which drugs reach the brain parenchyma depends not only on their route of administration but also on their ability to cross the cerebral endothelium, also called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which constitutes the main brain interface modulating exchanges of compounds between the brain and blood (Abbott et al., 2010). Passive diffusion is the primary route by which solutes cross membranes. According to the pH partition theory, nonionized drugs cross cell membranes, and neuropharmacodynamic events depend solely on their neutral unbound fraction in the plasma. The relative \"sufficient\" lipophilicity (estimated by log P) of the neutral form has been historically correlated with the rate of drug diffusion at the BBB. As 6% of cocaine is uncharged (clog P 3.1) at pH 7.4 (clog D 7.4 1.5; pK a 8.6), it has been assumed that this 6% crosses the BBB by passive diffusion and fast enough to produce its CNS effects, whereas the 94% of positively charged cocaine cannot cross the BBB. Although the pH partition theory is physicochemically relevant, it leads to the misinterpretation of the CNS effects of many psychotropic drugs, such as ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine [MDMA]; clog P 1.8; clog D 7.4 \u22120.9; pK a 10.1), which are 99.8% cationic at neutral pH. An alternative hypothesis is that a carrier-mediated transport process, capable of carrying at least the cationic form of these psychostimulant substances across the BBB, may also be involved.",

            "text": "The question of how CNS drugs are transferred to the brain parenchyma has been poorly addressed, mainly because of these redundant mechanistic assumptions concerning passive diffusion. Although some pharmacokinetic studies suggest that passive diffusion is not the only mechanism by which cocaine crosses the BBB (Benuck et al., 1987;Gatley et al., 1990;Telang et al., 1999;Raje et al., 2003), this mechanism of transport has not yet been elucidated at the BBB. Although our knowledge of carrier-mediated systems is still incomplete, it is known that ABC transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) or BCRP (ABCG2) could be involved in the unidirectional transport of their substrates by limiting their brain uptake and/or increasing their efflux from the brain into the blood. Some bidirectional SLC transporters are also known to be involved in the transport of compounds at the BBB (Abbott et al., 2010;Giacomini et al., 2010;Tournier et al., 2011). Functional studies have previously established that a drug/proton-coupled antiporter present at the mouse BBB speeds up the transport of nicotine or clonidine and that it can unlikely be saturated by their in vivo pharmacological plasma concentrations (Andre et al., 2009;Cisternino et al., 2013). Cocaine has also been shown previously to modulate the clonidine transporter at the mouse BBB (Andre et al., 2009).",

Both models permit the qualitative and quantitative properties of drug transport to be determined (Takasato et al., 1984;Dagenais et al., 2000) and can be used to evaluate the contribution of carrier-mediated systems by assessing the concentration dependency of the transport through exposure of these models to cocaine concentrations high enough to surpass the concentration at the half-maximal carrier velocity (K m ) of the transporter (Kell et al., 2013). Our results show that the transport of cocaine across the BBB mainly involves a carriermediated system functionally identified as a proton/cocaineantiporter, in addition to a relative minor passive component in the pharmacological vascular/extracellular concentration range. The features of this molecularly unknown transporter highlight its importance in governing the delivery of cocaine to the mouse and possibly to the human brain.",

            "text": "We performed drug-cocaine interaction studies on hCMEC/D3 cells and mice using cis-inhibition of [ 3 H]-cocaine transport to discriminate between the effects of known transporters possibly involved in drug influx and to gain more insight into the molecular features of drugs that could interact with the cocaine transporter. Many compounds inhibit/modulate transporters, although they are not necessarily transported themselves, as is known for cocaine and SLC6A3. The concentrations used do not reflect or predict in vivo drug-drug interactions, as the unbound concentrations used can never be reached by their systemic administration in mice or humans. We used broad-range inhibitors like tetraethylammonium (TEA), choline, and carnitine, which inhibit a wide range of known organic transporters, including Octs (Slc22a1-3), Mate (Slc47a1), and Octn (Slc22a4-5), both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds used at concentrations surpassing the cocaine transporter K m did not significantly modulate the transport of [ 3 H]-cocaine in vitro or in vivo, suggesting that these SLC transporters are not involved in cocaine transport at the BBB (Tables 1A and 2). It has previously been demonstrated that Oct1-3, Pmat, and Mate1 are not expressed or functional at the mouse BBB (Agarwal et al., 2012;Andre et al., 2012). However, the hCMEC/D3 cell line has been shown to express some OCTs that could affect its functional properties (Weksler et al., 2013). In parallel experiments in the hCMEC/D3 cell line, we found that MPP + , a known substrate of the OCTs, was significantly inhibited by TEA (2 mM), a substrate/inhibitor for OCTs (data not shown). However, the same TEA concentration did not affect [ 3 H]-cocaine transport in these cells (Table 1A). Previous reports have also identified a range of substrates of a drug/proton-antiporter, such as clonidine, nicotine, diphenhydramine, oxycodone, and naloxone; these significantly affected [ 3 H]-cocaine transport with varying potencies (Tables 1 and 2). Some cocaine metabolites were also tested: benzoylecgonine and ecgonine altered [ 3 H]-cocaine transport in vivo and/or in vitro but with low potencies, whereas a few other cocaine-related compounds such as norcocaine, cocaethylene, and ecgonine methylester significantly decreased the BBB transport of [ 3 H]-cocaine at lower concentrations (Tables 1B and 2).",

The trans-efflux zero or exit of [ 3 H]-cocaine was strongly stimulated (P < 0.001) by MDMA, MDPV, nicotine, and diphenhydramine (Figure 3), suggesting that they may also be substrates of the cocaine transporter.

Cocaine is 0.06% neutral at pH e 5.40, 0.6% at pH e 6.40, and 5.9% at pH e 7.40. The incubation of hCMEC/D3 cells with KH buffer set to yield a pH e of 5.40, 6.40, or 7.40 shows a 2.5-and 4.6-fold increase (P < 0.001) in [ 3 H]-cocaine uptake at pH e 6.40 and 7.40, respectively, as compared with pH e 5.40 (Figure 4a). Similarly, the brain transport of [ 3 H]-cocaine measured for 60 seconds at pH e 6.40 and 7.40 in mice was significantly increased (P < 0.001) by 4.7-and 16.9fold, respectively, as compared with its transport measured at pH e 5.40 (Figure 5a). This increase could be related to the higher neutral cocaine fraction in the perfusate and/or to a change in the transport rate according to the proton extracellular concentration. Adding unlabeled cocaine (10 mM) led to a significant 1.8-, 2.0-, and 1.9-fold decrease in [ 3 H]-cocaine transport at the mouse BBB at pH e 5.40, 6.40, and 7.40, respectively, confirming that a carrier-mediated process is involved (Figure 5a).

It can be difficult to study the influence of ions such as sodium on a putative H + -coupled transport system in situ, because acute exposure to an Na + -free extracellular medium can alter the Na + -dependent transporters involved in controlling the pH i and thus indirectly alter the activity of proton-dependent transporters. We then perfused the brains of mice with [ 3 H]-cocaine in lithium buffer, which does not significantly affect the pH i at the BBB (Figure 5b)  (Andre et al., 2009), and compared this with [ 3 H]-cocaine in regular Krebs-carbonate buffer.

            "text": "Cocaine saturability studies of brain endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro demonstrate the coexistence of an additive carrier-mediated process along with the passive diffusion flux of cocaine at the BBB. The highest plasma cocaine concentrations reported in human or rodent studies are <10 \u00b5M (Benuck et al., 1987;Booze et al., 1997;Volkow et al., 2000). Therefore, according to the apparent K m , an unbound extracellular/vascular cocaine concentration <4.5 mM in mice or 0.12 mM in human cells would allow a cocaine flux across the BBB that is always proportional to its vascular/extracellular concentration. At the pharmacotoxicological range of cocaine concentrations (which are far less than the transporter K m ), the passive diffusion flux of cocaine accounts for about 22.5% of the total cocaine influx in mice and 5.9% of the flux in hCMEC/ D3 cells. A comparison of the in vivo passive (~4.5 \u00b5L/sec/g) and carrier-mediated (~15.5 \u00b5L/sec/g) transport rates suggests that the carrier-mediated influx of cocaine is 3.4 times greater than its passive diffusion when concentrations are less than the apparent carrier-mediated K m . This carrier-mediated component could be responsible for the fast rise in cocaine concentration in the brain parenchyma. Although both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that the proportion of passive cocaine flux is minor compared with its active flux, quantitative differences do exist between the 2 types of models. Some in vitroin vivo studies have identified a few factors that could affect these proportions. The presence of an unstirred water layer in static in vitro models, but not in in situ perfusion model, could contribute to a boundary layer of water that decreases passive diffusion in vitro (Avdeef et al., 2004). The greatest biophysical difference between models comes from the lack of a pressure gradient in in vitro systems, which could allow passive diffusion to be described simply by Fick's law. The existence of a hydrostatic pressure gradient in vivo/in situ permits a greater convective solvent effect that also affects and increases the convective/passive transport of the solute in accordance with the Navier-Stokes equations. This also contributes to a greater passive diffusion rate in vivo compared with in vitro experiments. Although speculative, differences between the K m and V max measured in vitro/human and in vivo/mouse models could possibly be linked to interspecies differences and expression levels, respectively. Better molecular tools are needed to understand the differences between models in this polyspecific, high-capacity, carrier-mediated system.",

            "text": "Our studies suggest that P-gp is not involved but reveal a carrier-mediated system that favors the influx of cocaine at the BBB, which could result from its ability to interact with an SLC transporter. The lack of in vitro or in vivo inhibition by known transporter inhibitors and the lack of differences in Oct1,2knockout mice suggest that at least Octs, Mate, and Octn are not likely to be involved in the active handling of cocaine in these models. The diverse chemical or biochemical approaches used in in vitro and in vivo protocols altered the transport of cocaine at the BBB in a way that suggests the presence of a sodium-independent cocaine/proton-antiporter with features similar to those found for nicotine, diphenhydramine, tramadol, and clonidine transport at the mouse BBB (Andre et al., 2009;Cisternino et al., 2013). A transporter with similar biochemical features has also been found in some rodent BBB cell lines, where it transports oxycodone, diphenhydramine, and codeine (Okura et al., 2008;Fischer et al., 2010;Sadiq et al., 2011). The trans-stimulation of cocaine transport in hCMEC/D3 cells by nicotine, diphenhydramine, MDMA, or MDPV suggests that they share the same transporter. Interestingly, an analogous MDMA/ proton-antiporter, which interacts with some other amphetamines, has also been functionally characterized in Caco-2 cells (Kuwayama et al., 2008). The lack of a trans-stimulation effect of benzoylecgonine could also indicate that it is not a substrate, in accordance with certain studies showing that benzoylecgonine has no significant brain uptake (Gatley et al., 1994;Chow et al., 2001). To obtain more information on the chemical structures able to interact with this transporter, we performed cis-inhibition experiments with substrate-related compounds that shared a similar DAT and with other pharmacological substances targeting the CNS, such as opioids, diphenhydramine, and nicotine. Compounds like heroin, diphenhydramine, or imipramine were shown in vitro to exhibit a high potency of inhibition. In the smaller set of compounds tested in vivo, diphenhydramine was shown to be the strongest. However, the concentration needed to significantly inhibit cocaine transport precluded any potential for drug-drug interactions in vivo.

            "text": "Neurobiological studies have recently confirmed that the BBB transport rate of drugs of abuse like nicotine, morphine, or cocaine is a critical factor that affects the neurobehavioral plasticity involved in addiction (Samaha and Robinson, 2005;Minogianis et al., 2013;Seleman et al., 2014). A higher rate of cocaine brain delivery is associated with a greater risk of addiction in rodents (Minogianis et al., 2013). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have also shown that the pharmacokinetic profiles of drugs of abuse like nicotine and cocaine, and in particular the speed/rate at which drugs enter the human brain, are crucial for their reward effects (Volkow et al., 2012). Indeed, these PET studies have shown that the rate of cocaine entry into the brain is the key factor associated with the subjective \"high\" effect rather than the overall presence or extent of drug distribution into the brain (Volkow et al., 1997a(Volkow et al., , 1997b(Volkow et al., , 2000. Interestingly, some differences in pharmacokinetics and cocaine conditioning have been shown depending on the strain of mice used and suggest that the DAB strain is more resistant to cocaine conditioning in the place preference paradigm (Niculescu et al., 2005;Eisener-Dorman et al., 2011). However, our experiments did not reveal a difference in cocaine transport at the BBB of DAB mice, suggesting that such cocaine conditioning differences are more likely linked to a neural mechanism (Eisener-Dorman et al., 2011). Remarkably, a clinical PET study performed in cocaine abusers abstinent for 3 months (detoxification unit) and who were defined by a history of cocaine use of >4 g/wk of snorting and/or crack for at least 6 months has shown a decreased brain uptake of [ 11 C]-cocaine without any change for DAT availability (Volkow et al., 1996). In light of our results, this decrease in BBB cocaine uptake in recent cocaine abusers could be related to decreased activity of this cocaine transporter, possibly representing an endothelial cell-related brain mechanism involved in tolerance.",
