We show that a two-sided monopolist may find it short-run profit-maximizing to charge a price below marginal cost on one side of the market. Hence showing that the price is below marginal cost on one side of a two-sided market cannot be considered a sign of predation. We then argue for a two-sided Areeda-Turner rule that takes into account price-cost margins on both sides of the market. Two examples highlight that applying a one-sided Areeda-Turner rule may lead one to assess legitimate prices as predatory or to consider predatory prices as legitimate.",

            "text": "In this paper, we extend the Areeda-Turner rule to two-sided markets. We do so by following the original logic of Areeda and Turner (1975). In their seminal article, the authors set out to identify a rational dividing line between legitimately competitive prices and prices that should be regarded as predatory. Adopting the classical definition of predation as the deliberate sacrifice of present revenues for the purpose of driving rivals out of the market and then recouping the losses, they proposed that '' [u]nless at or above average cost, a price below reasonably anticipated (1) shortrun marginal costs or (2) average variable costs should be deemed predatory, and the monopolist may not defend on the grounds that his price was 'promotional' or merely met an equally low price of a competitor''. In addition '' [r]ecognizing that marginal cost data are typically unavailable'' they concluded that '' [a] price below reasonably anticipated average variable cost should be conclusively presumed unlawful''. 1 Following the original logic of Areeda and Turner (1975), we seek a threshold for the price, such that a price below this threshold should be deemed predatory. We argue that such a threshold needs to take into account the specificity of two-sided markets. In these markets firms act as platforms and sell two different products or services to two distinct groups of customers. 2 An example is the newspaper market, in which publishers sell content to readers and advertising slots to advertisers.",

Readers may or may not be affected by the amount of advertising in the newspaper, 4 but for the market to be two-sided already the presence of one indirect network effect is sufficient. 5 Whereas customers do not internalize the externality (or externalities) above, two-sided platforms do internalize it (them) when deciding their optimal pricing 1  Areeda and Turner (1975, p. 733).",

Indeed in the latter case there is only one group of customers who typically buy both goods (e.g. the ink-jet printer and the ink-jet cartridge) and thus, unless they are naive, they respond to changes in the prices of both. In a newspaper market, instead, a reader does not care about the price charged to advertisers and vice versa advertisers do not decide whether to place an ad in a newspaper based on the cover price of the latter. 4 Empirical evidence so far seems to suggest that on average readers of daily newspapers are either indifferent to or slightly like advertising (which is usually not targeted but avoidable). See Argentesi and Filistrucchi (2007), Fan (2013) and Filistrucchi et al. (2012). Readers of magazines seem instead to attach a positive value to advertising (which is avoidable and more targeted). See Kaiser and Wright (2006) and Kaiser and Song (2009). 5 See . strategies.

A recent review discussing these issues is Evans and Schmalensee (2015). Parker and Alstyne (2005) were among the first to present an economic model that highlights that in two-sided markets pricing below marginal cost on one side may be a (nonstrategic) profit-maximising strategy. Indeed, by pricing below marginal cost on one side of the market a firm increases sales on that side, thus boosting demand and profits on the other side. Wright (2004) included the claim that ''price below marginal cost on one side of the market is a sign of predation'' among the eight fallacies that derive from applying a one-sided logic to two-sided markets. 8 Despite the warnings of the economics literature, competition authorities and courts tend to analyse predatory claims with a one-sided logic. In the recent case Bottin Cartographes versus Google, 9 for instance, the Commercial Court of Paris 6 One can also express the price level in terms of advertising pages. In that case it is the sum of the advertising price and the circulation revenues per-advertising-page. 7 Note that such a ratio is equivalent to the ratio between the revenues from the two sides. In the newspapers' business the ratio of circulation revenues to advertising revenues (or vice versa) is sometimes called the 'financing mix'. 8 To our knowledge, no paper discusses the conditions for predation in prices to take place in a two-sided market. A partial exception is Motta and Vasconcelos (2012) who present a model of platform competition in which below-cost pricing can be used to deter the entry of a more efficient rival. However, the result in Motta and Vasconcelos (2012) crucially depends on the fact that one of the two firms is already present in the market, while the other is trying to enter. 9 Bottin Cartographes v. Google Inc. and Google France Srl, Commercial Court of Paris, 15th chamber, 31 January 2012, available at http://www.legalis.net/spip.php?page=jurisprudence-decision&id_article= 3327. In July 2009 Bottin Cartographes SAS (hereafter 'Bottin') filed a lawsuit before the Commercial Court of Paris (Paris Tribunal de Commerce) against Google Inc. and Google France Srl (hereinafter collectively 'Google') for alleged abuse of a dominant position in the market of online mapping services found Google guilty of the abuse of a dominant position in the market for online maps that allow stores' geolocation. 10 The Court reached its decision by simply considering that the price of Google Maps API, being equal to 0 \u20ac, was necessarily lower than the production costs of the service. Interestingly, the Court stopped just short of recognizing the implications for competition policy of the two-sided business strategy of Google, as it recognized that Google, according to the contracts, would be able to insert advertising in its Google Maps API service and therefore sell targeted advertising.",

Testing for predatory pricing in a two-sided market must take into account the presence of the indirect network effects between the two sides. Hence, it has to recognize that pricecost margins on the two sides of the market are interrelated. We thus show that one needs to compare the overall price level with the joint marginal cost of the two-sides of the market. Since, as already noted by Areeda and Turner (1975), marginal cost data are difficult to obtain, one should compare the overall price level with the overall average variable cost.",

While Bottin offers its service in exchange for an annual fee and an ex post compensation based on actual consumption, the ordinary version of Google Maps API is provided to its customers on a free basis. Bottin claimed that this had to be considered a predatory pricing and that by doing so Google aimed to extend its dominant position in the market of online search to the connected relevant market. 10 More precisely, with its decision of 31 January 2012 the Commercial Court of Paris found Google guilty of the abuse of a dominant position pursuant to Article L-420-2 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code and, as a consequence, awarded Bottin 500,000 \u20ac damages and interests, in addition to ordering Google to publish the judgment at its expense in several French and international newspapers. 11 Bottin Cartographes v.

Two-sided non-transaction markets are characterized by the absence of a transaction between the two sides of the market and, even though an interaction is present, it is usually not observable, so that a per-transaction (or per-interaction) fee or a two-part tariff is not possible. Typical examples are media markets. Two-sided transaction markets are instead characterized by the presence and observability of a transaction between the two groups of platform users. As a result, the platform is able to charge not only a price for joining the platform, but also one for using it, i.e. it can ask a two-part tariff. Examples in this category include payment cards schemes, virtual marketplaces, auction houses and operating systems.",

It turns out that the latter intuition is, to some extent, true also for two-sided non-transaction markets. By deriving our conditions from a formal model, we explain what this extra term is in a two-sided non-transaction market and highlight that one also needs to take into account the extra cost incurred on the other side of the market.",

To understand these total elasticities, note that the total elasticity gQ R P R includes, in addition to the changes in Q R directly due to the change in P R ; also the additional changes in Q R due to the indirect network effects. Consider the newspaper example: Suppose that the monopolist increases the price to the readers P R while keeping the price to the advertisers P A unchanged; as a result the quantity of readers Q R decreases. This effect would be captured by a direct (or partial) elasticity g Q R P R . However, the decrease in the number of readers Q R also decreases the quantity of advertising sold Q A (as advertisers willingness to pay for an advertising slot in a newspaper increases with the number of readers). In turn, the decrease in advertising sold Q A increases the quantity of readers Q R (if readers of newspapers are annoyed by advertising), and so on. A similar reasoning applies to the total elasticities gQ A P R ,gQ R P A and gQ A P A , which measure the effects of an increase in P R on Q A and of P A on Q R and on Q A . From (9) one can check that the total own-price elasticities, gQ R P R and gQ A P A , are negative when the condition for the existence of the reduced form demand functions is satisfied (i.e. when (4) holds). As a result, the first term on the right hand side, in both Eqs. (10) and (11), is positive. In both cases it resembles the term on the right hand side in the Eq. (1), but differs in that the elasticities in Eqs. 10and 11include the indirect network effects.",

On 23 June 1994, while The Daily Telegraph matched the new price of The Times (lowering its price by 37.5 %), The Independent was offered on a one-day sale for 20 p, with the following announcement appearing on its first page: ''We remain dedicated to journalism of the highest quality and integrity. Readers will understand that this can never be cheap''. On 24 June 1994 The Times lowered its price by another 33 %, from 30 to 20 p, bringing the overall price cut to 55 %. Finally, on 1 August 1994 The Independent was also forced to lower its price by 40 %, from 50 to 30 p. Figure 1 depicts this price war graphically. 20 The Independent claimed to be the target of a predatory attempt by the Times. It held that the prices of 30 and 20 p per copy of The Times amounted respectively to a ''\u00a318m a year'' and a ''\u00a330m a year'' subsidy. It filed a complaint with the OFT. A 'deep pocket' predator story was put forward, according to which NIN (which owned The Times) could afford to sustain higher losses than could The Independent, thanks to cross-subsidization from other profitable media businesses that it owned. The OFT investigations into the price cuts of September 1993 and June 2004 led to the conclusion that The Times was not dominant in The readers' market for national daily newspapers and that The Independent was just one of its competitors. Hence The Times could not reasonably expect that the losses that it would incur in the ''predatory'' campaign would be recouped by a higher price after The Independent would have exited the market. As a result the OFT dismissed the claims of predation.",

We thus use this estimate (adjusting it by the monthly CPI) to estimate the overall markups of the Times from 1991 to 1997 per copy sold, taking into account both the cover price and the revenues from advertising as suggested by the two-sided Areeda-Tuner rule in (18). 23  Figure 2 shows that, although the overall per copy markup of The Times dropped substantially during the price war, it always remained above zero. Clearly, with a marginal cost of 32.5 p at a price of 30 p or 20 p, the price-cost margin solely on the readers' side was negative.

The OFT also concluded that Aberdeen Journals had engaged in predation against its only rival in the relevant market, the Aberdeen & District Independent: it deliberately incurred losses on its free newspaper, the Herald & Post, by pricing advertising space at below average variable cost in an attempt to exclude the Aberdeen & District Independent. According to the OFT, predatory pricing started in response to the launch of the Aberdeen & District Independent in 1996 and continued until 29 March 2000, 4 weeks after the Competition Act came into force. In order to assess predation, the OFT conducted an empirical analysis that was aimed at establishing whether advertising revenues were higher than average variable costs. 25 While the Herald & Post did not incur losses prior to the entry of the Independent, it started to make losses in March 1996 after it heavily decreased advertising rates, increased pagination and increased circulation.",

Also, the pagination, i.e. the number of pages per month, of the Herald & Post was significantly increased following the launch of the Independent from under 100 pages per month in the period October 1995 to April 1996 to 148 pages in May 1996 and peaking between September 1998 and October 1999 when it was in the range of 350 to 480 pages a month. Lastly, the distribution of the Herald & Post substantially increased after the entry of the Independent from below 100,000 to as much as 126,000 in 1999.",

In particular, it carried out its analysis with reference to both a shorter time frame (the month) and a longer time frame (the alleged predation period). Clearly, considering a larger time frame implies considering more costs as variable and makes a finding of predation more likely. When taking the longer time horizon, the OFT included among variable costs the costs of printing, distribution, editorial staff (i.e. costs on the readers side) and advertising staff (i.e. costs on the advertising side). It thus estimated that The Herald & Post was selling below average variable costs at least through March 2000. Furthermore, treating editorial staff and the advertising team as fixed and the cost of printing and distribution (i.e. only costs on the readers side) as variable, the OFT estimated that the Herald & Post's revenues exceeded variable costs only on five occasions between July 1996 and March 2000.",

In fact, even if on one-side of the market the platform gives away the product for free, as it is the case with free newspapers, then one still needs to apply the two-sided Areeda-Turner rule given by Eq. (18). However, since on the readers' side of the market the newspaper was given away for free, Eq. (18) reduces to P A \u00c0 AVC A \u00c0 Q R Q A AVC R \\0 when the OFT takes as a reference the longer time frame and to P A \u00c0 Q R Q A AVC R \\0 when it chooses the shorter time horizon. 26",

Furthermore, for a two-sided monopolist, even in the absence of actual or potential competition, it may be profit-maximizing to charge a price below marginal cost on one side of the market. As a result, the Areeda-Turner rule that the price is below average variable cost or marginal cost on one side of the market cannot be considered as a sign of predation in two-sided markets.",

We argued that one should apply the rule by taking into account revenues and costs from both sides of the market. Hence, in a two-sided market the rule should be rephrased as requiring that the weighted average of the prices, with the weights given by the marginal network effect, is below the weighted average of the marginal costs. As in a one-sided market, given the difficulty to measure marginal costs, for most practical purposes, courts should presume as unlawful a (weighted) price level that is below the (weighted) average variable cost level. The only partial exception to this rule is the particular case in which one of the two sides of the market is indifferent to the other side. In that case, to assess the predatory nature of prices on the side that exerts no externality on the other, a one-sided Areeda-Turner rule can be applied.",

The first case, the Times-Independent price war, concerns a two-sided market where customers on both sides pay for the product or service that they receive. The Independent claimed that the cover prices of The Times were predatory because they were lower than the average variable cost of a copy of the newspaper. We showed that if one took into account the revenues from advertising, as suggested by a two-sided Areeda-Turner rule, the prices could not be presumed predatory. The Aberdeen Journals case illustrates how one should deal with those two-sided markets in which one side of the market does not pay, as the case concerned predation by a free daily newspaper. Correctly, the OFT took into account costs from both sides of the market (in addition to the price of advertising) when calculating profit margins.",
