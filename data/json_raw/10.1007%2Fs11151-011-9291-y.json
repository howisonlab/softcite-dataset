Advocates of \"net neutrality\"-including President Obama and the current FCC majority-believe that owners of broadband distribution systems (hardware used to distribute Internet and video services) and producers of certain \"must-have\" video content should be subject to prophylactic regulation that transcends present-day antitrust law enforcement. In the economic terms that are used in debates on competition policy, the concern is with vertical integration that may give firms both the opportunity (through denial of access or price discrimination) and incentive (increased profit) to restrict competition. This paper's central point is that virtually every production process in the economy is vertically integrated, and economics predicts changes in the extent",

            "text": "The antitrust policy revolution that began, to choose a somewhat arbitrary date, with Justice Potter Stewart's dissenting opinion in U. S. v. Von's Grocery (1966), led to the introduction of modern economic analysis in antitrust enforcement. One result was the gradual withdrawal of per se antitrust condemnation of vertical restraints, under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, along with a tendency to treat vertical mergers and acquisitions with less suspicion than had been the case, for example, in Brown Shoe (1962). In Brown Shoe the U.S. Supreme Court condemned as anticompetitive vertical \"market foreclosure\" the acquisition of a retail chain of shoe stores (with 2% of the retail market) by a shoe manufacturer with 4% of shoe production. 1 Vertical restraints (tying, exclusive dealing, and some forms of price discrimination, among other practices) are sometimes regarded as the contractual counterpart of vertical integration. 2 In spite of the general trend toward reduced antitrust concern with vertical relationships, 3 vertical integration has remained a policy problem in certain regulated industries, including communications, transportation, and energy. In this sector certain stages of production have traditionally been seen as \"bottlenecks\" that are capable of exercising monopoly power and are often subject to price regulation on that account. An incentive to escape the effects of such regulation sometimes has led to vertical integration that would otherwise be privately inefficient, and to anticompetitive behavior that is aimed at suppressing competition in the vertical products. The best-known example is the old Bell System, in which AT&T defended its long distance and telephone equipment monopolies by denying competitors' access to vertically integrated local telephone networks (Noll and Owen 1994). Similar issues have arisen in electricity transmission and distribution, in rail transport, and in gas and oil pipelines. Antitrust litigation, regulatory reform, and other remedies have mitigated many of these problems, but vertical issues remain in each industry.",

This controversial and complex case was characterized by Microsoft as an unwise attack on its success in developing new technology. This view builds in part on Joseph Schumpeter's (1950) idea that an important form of competition involves innovation-stimulating struggles for market dominance, success at which generates economic rewards that incentivize investment in research and development of successive generations of technology (Evans and Schmalensee 2002;Schmalensee 2000). From a Schumpeterian perspective, Microsoft's monopoly of operating system software, far from being regrettable, was a necessary and temporary stimulant of continued technological progress. 4 Hahn and Passel (2010) put the point succinctly in a recent online posting: Regulators need to recognize that in markets driven by rapidly changing technology and huge economies of scale, it's natural for one firm or another to be king of the hill-albeit temporarily. So market share alone is no indicator of anticompetitive behavior or of the difficulty a newcomer with a better idea would have in competing for the business.",

The original complaint was about a longhaul/short-haul rate differential that was attributable to the exploitation of demand elasticity variation along a rail line. Later, concern focused on discrimination aimed at raising rivals' costs, which was typified by John D. Rockefeller's efforts to disadvantage competitors, who were shipping oil from western Pennsylvania and Ohio to eastern markets. Common carrier regulation of railroads, in the end, promoted rather than discouraged discrimination in rates and tended to restrain competition in both rail shipments and other modes of surface transportation (Kahn 1988;Owen 2007).",

That is, specialization and therefore productivity is limited by scale, and scale is limited by the extent of the market. The extent of the market is determined by many factors including transport costs and trade policies. As Stigler (1951) noted, the principle that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market suggests that large scale production should permit vertical \"disintegration,\" with separate agents that specialize in each stage of production, and relying on the market to deal not only with preceding and succeeding stages of production but also trade between the previously integrated specialties. Disintegration permits the industrial organization of each stage of production to be optimized, for it would be surprising if all stages of production had the same minimum efficient scale. Evidence of industries disintegrating in this way as they grow is not abundant, however. Evidently, vertical integration provides benefits that usually outweigh those of optimizing scale at each stage of production.",

It is also clear that machinery is labor-saving-it enhances the productivity of each hour of labor-and that the machinery need not be used in fixed proportion to labor. 7 However, Smith makes no mention of the management of production or of the details of the transition between one stage of the production process and the next. Nor does he make mention of a factory owner or a supplier of capital, either for the provision of machinery or to finance work in progress or inventories of raw materials and finished products. 8 On what terms were the semi-finished products of one stage of pin production transferred to the next? There is nothing in Smith's story to tell us whether each specialized worker or workers sold their intermediate products to the next, in what might be deemed a market, or whether the flow of production was directed by a supervisor or agent acting on behalf of the workers, or on behalf of one or more of the factors of production, or as an agent of the ultimate buyers of pins.

Smith reports on \"a small manufactory \u2026 where ten men only were employed,\" and implies that these workers performed all of the eighteen or so sequential tasks described, from drawing the wire to placing the finished pins into the paper. We know from other sources that pin-making was already a specialized category of metal-working by the time of King Henry VII Tudor. A small Yorkshire town called Sherburn-in-Elmet was described in the 1540s as \"a market town with many pinners.\" 9 Consideration of the limited extent of the medieval market suggests that these pinners were either individual cottagers, each fully integrated, or cottagers who were specialized in one step or another of the manufacturing sequence, or some combination. There were unlikely to have been \"many\" pinners each consisting of an establishment with 10 or more workers such as Smith observed more than 200 years later. But we do not know whether the cottagers were organized as individual entrepreneurs, selling semi-finished products amongst themselves or as contractors in a \"putting out\" system that was organized and directed by a merchant, as was common in the British textile industry by the eighteenth century.",

Fixing the head of the pin to the shaft remained the most time-consuming part of the process, accounting for almost half of all manufacturing costs. (Id., p. 176) Women and children were employed to reduce these costs, and factory owners contracted \"with overseers of workhouses and superintendents of gaols for the services of inmates.\" (Id.) Pin manufacturers \"often made rapid adjustments to heading capacity through the medium of outworkers.\" (Id.,p. 177) Descriptions of pin making in the U.S. have not been found, but metal-working factories in nineteenth-century America often used a form of organization called \"inside contracting\":",

Differences in the type and degree of integration between firms and over time clearly are much-influenced by path dependence. But it is clear that even in Smith's day some stages of the production of pins took place outside the factory walls, and were not generally brought inside until sometime in the nineteenth century. Even then the pin makers did not mine or refine the metal or own retail outlets. Despite significant outsourcing, there cannot have been a \"market\" in the extreme sense of a large number of anonymous agents buying and selling intermediate goods in an auction environment.",

And the same is true inside the walls. Vertical integration is a matter of degree even at a single stage of production. It responds to the historical path of the firm, its economic environment, available legal and political institutions, and social context. A gross change in the extent of vertical (dis)integration may take place either through (dis)investment in production or distribution facilities or by selling/purchasing existing facilities to or from suppliers or customers. But more subtly and probably commonly, a change in the degree of vertical integration takes place whenever the owners of a firm acquire or concede a degree of direct resource control in contractual arrangements with factor or input suppliers or customers.",

Holmstrom and Roberts (1998, pp. 83-84) describe an interesting practice in the steel minimill industry. Minimills produce steel from scrap metal rather than from iron ore and coke. Efficient steel production requires that the scrap and other material inputs with which the furnace is \"charged\" have a very specific composition in order to produce steel with desired characteristics. The exact specification of the appropriate charge is calculated by highly specialized experts. One producer delegates responsibility not just control over the design of the charge, but even over the steps necessary to assemble the charge itself and to insert the charge into the furnace. This is the very heart of the steel-making business. The minimill in this case outsources the service of supervising and even performing a crucial production step inside its own factory.",

As suggested above, however, at least some of the coordination may be accomplished by marketlike devices, such as relational contracts, incentive pay, profit sharing, out-sourcing, and inside contracting.

Participants include the owners of factors of production, as well as suppliers of inputs including such services as risk-bearing and management, middlemen, and consumers of outputs. The relationships among the participants can take many forms: anonymous counterparties in spot transactions, long-or short-term formal or relational contracts, employer-employee, and combinations or intermediate versions of these connections. Even the simplest process usually can be meaningfully decomposed into sequential or simultaneous actions that are undertaken by separate agents. Involving multiple agents requires cooperation, motivated by an increase in surplus compared to unilateral production.

Similar variations exist in the relationships between neighboring agents in a sequential production process, sometimes yielding dysfunctions that are the subject of an extensive literature (Gibbons 2010;Robinson 2008).

Of course, all contracts are incomplete because most contingencies are so remote or inconsequential that they are not worth negotiating. The theoretical remedy is a law of contract construction that requires judges to interpret the contract in the way that the parties would have done ex ante, or at least to have clearly predictable default rules for allocating risks. An incomplete contract has economic significance chiefly when it leads the parties to fail to maximize joint gains; the incompleteness is not a failure to enumerate exhaustively all contingencies but rather a failure to harmonize the parties' incentives. Of course this may not be possible in circumstances that would require unlawful (or otherwise unenforceable) constraints on the parties' ex post behavior.

This category consists of vertical integration that gives rise to, or more fully exploits, market power. There are essentially three points about these models: First, vertical restraints that appear to be associated with vertical integration can often be achieved through contracts instead, although not necessarily as effectively, and with different antitrust risks. Second, the welfare effects of market-power-motivated vertical integration are often positive or ambiguous. The best-known examples are the elimination of double marginalization and partial integration to support price discrimination. Riordan (2008, p. 48) provides a review of the literature on the competitive effects of vertical integration. Like many other economists, Riordan points out that vertical integration is generally a welfare-enhancing response to conditions that would otherwise be characterized as market failures. \"A general presumption that vertical integration is pro-competitive is warranted by a substantial economics literature identifying efficiency benefits of vertical integration, including empirical studies demonstrating positive effects of vertical integration in various industries.\"",

Summarizing, L&S conclude-[O]verall a fairly clear empirical picture emerges. The data appear to be telling us that efficiency considerations overwhelm anticompetitive motives in most contexts. Furthermore, even when we limit attention to natural monopolies or tight oligopolies, the evidence of anticompetitive harm is not strong. (L&S at 677) \u2026 As to what the data reveal in relation to public policy, \u2026 [w]e are \u2026 somewhat surprised at what the weight of the evidence is telling us. It says that, under most circumstances, profit maximizing vertical-integration decisions are efficient, not just from the firms' but also from the consumers' points of view. Although there are isolated studies that contradict this claim, the vast majority support it. Moreover, even in industries that are highly concentrated so that horizontal considerations assume substantial importance, the net effect of vertical integration appears to be positive in many instances. We therefore conclude that, faced with a vertical arrangement, the burden of evidence should be placed on competition authorities to demonstrate that that arrangement is harmful before the practice is attacked. Furthermore, we have found clear evidence that restrictions on vertical integration that are imposed, often by local authorities, on owners of retail networks are usually detrimental to consumers. Given the weight of the evidence, it behooves government agencies to reconsider the validity of such restrictions (Lafontaine and Slade (2007, p. 680)).",

In other words, regulation itself can have the unintended consequence of damaging consumer welfare. 15 The monopolization case brought against the old Bell Telephone System by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1974 provides a useful but apparently rare example. 16 The Bell System defended its vertical and horizontal integration by claiming the existence of economies of scale and scope, as well as economies of vertical integration. In AT&T's view, natural monopoly attributes justified exclusionary tactics to discourage inefficient entry. The government argued that vertical integration was motivated not by economies but by a desire to escape regulatory constraints on its profits. The local operating companies had no incentive to exclude AT&T competitors aside from their vicarious interest in the prosperity of their only stockholder (Noll and Owen 1994). After the breakup, competition flourished and prices fell precipitously at all three stages: long distance service, equipment manufacture, and local services. This evidence is consistent with the view that vertical integration in the old Bell System was the cause of considerable welfare loss. But generalizing from this example is difficult, in part because the role of regulators in the AT&T case was unique. For many years the FCC endorsed and facilitated the maintenance of the Bell System monopoly.",

Static price competition plays at best a minor role, although the interaction of pricing, any scale economies, and adoption lags might change this.

Over time, prices are falling or, equivalently, product quality is improving. Driving this process is the desire to capture quasi-rents during the period of market dominance.

Such behavior is traditionally within the scope of private and government actions that enforce the \"attempt to monopolize\" provisions of the Sherman Act Sec. 2. A particular form of such behavior is the acquisition of potential rivals who are in possession of promising new technologies or product designs. For example, Google has recently acquired small online advertising-or video-related firms such as YouTube, DoubleClick, AdMob, and ITA. These acquisitions are subject to review under the standards of the Clayton Act Sec. 7, which are much stricter than Sherman Sec. 2. But of course non-Schumpeterian dominant firms have the same or similar incentives. There is no obvious reason why \"new economy\" firms require a different set of either Clayton Sec. 7 or Sherman Sec. 2 attempt standards than do other firms that compete mainly the basis of price or product quality. 20 Regulatory standards are set both by (often vague or poorly drafted) statutes and by regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over specific industries. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the last decade chose to assign Internet-related businesses to \"information services,\" a regulatory category that was established in 1966 for the purpose of differentiating non-regulated services from regulated telephone services. Information services are not subject to common carrier access regulation or price regulation. The FCC thought that information services could or should be provided on a competitive basis by anyone, including regulated monopoly firms if they operated with certain safeguards, such as separate accounting systems. In this case the intervention standard was whether or not the business was or could be made competitive, not whether it was or could be supplied by a monopolist through vertical integration.",

This legal distinction involves issues of jurisdiction as well as a sharp difference in standards. From an economic point of view there is no good reason for the distinction. The usual rationalization is that \"organic\" expansion of the scope of a firm is less likely to be anticompetitive than expansion through merger or acquisition, but the basis for this assessment has never been clear. After all, if the current status of an organization is made inefficient due to changes in its economic environment, it is best to move as rapidly as possible to the new, more efficient organizational form.

The acquisition was subject to review by the Department of Justice as well as the FCC. The Commission, more generally, has a policy of opposition to vertical integration between content suppliers and distributors such as cable systems and has even designated certain cable channels (e.g., regional sports networks, or RSNs) as the equivalent of \"essential facilities\" for competing video distributors. The Commission's policy relies on statutory authority in the Cable Act of 1992 and in its ability to impose \"conditions\" on the approval of license transfers incidental to mergers and acquisitions in the industry. In the Adelphia case (2006), for example, the assignment to Comcast Cable and Time Warner Cable of licenses that were owned by the estate of bankrupt Adelphia Cable was required in order to facilitate the sale of the associated Adelphia cable systems. The FCC focused on the possibility that video distribution rights that were owned by Comcast or Time-Warner for a given territory could be profitably withheld from competing distributors, such as DirecTV, if those companies also controlled local cable systems in the territory. The FCC thought that this incentive would be enhanced if the Adelphia transaction increased the percentage of potential subscribers in a territory that patronized Comcast or Time-Warner Cable. To prevent this effect, the Commission ordered the two companies to make certain that \"must have\" programming (such as RSNs) would be available to competitors at non-discriminatory and reasonable market prices, as those prices would stand but for acquisition of the Adelphia systems. This is enforced by compulsory baseball-style arbitration.",

Given the ease with which wholesale distributors (networks) of sporting events can enter and exit, as well as RSNs owned by teams themselves, the bulk of the rents from the business must accrue to the teams or leagues. If RSNs were not integrated with cable companies (a number aren't), they would demand equivalent terms from retail video distributors, including exclusivity if that is profit maximizing. Vertical integration, however, has the potential to increase welfare by various means, such as eliminating double marginalization. Perhaps more important, multichannel video distribution and Internet access in no longer a monopoly of cable systems. Satellites provide video competition, and telephone companies offer Internet access competition (and in some cases also video). The growing capacity and speed of wireless \"3G\" and especially \"4G\" mobile device networks will offer competition on both fronts. It is now possible to watch some professional-quality video entertainment on portable computers as well as desktop computers. An iPad, for example, can receive and exhibit online video programming even on a 3G network. The most effective policy, based on past experience with such interventions, would be to ensure that wireless providers have sufficient spectrum to offer effective competition to the wireline and satellite incumbents. There is no reason, aside from regulatory constraints on uses of available spectrum, to suppose that broadband distribution is any species of natural monopoly.

There is no reason to single out the most recent change in structure as inherently suspicious from an antitrust perspective. Distinctions between \"firms\" and \"markets\" are artificial legal or taxonomic conveniences. Production takes place on account of agent relationships that span a multidimensional spectrum, of which one dimension ranges from fiat-like to market-like. An exclusive focus on fiat-like organizations is likely to miss a great deal of significant economic activity. Vertical integration by fiat-like organizations is much more likely to be an efficiency-enhancing reaction to environmental stress than to portend harm to competition and consumers. Section 2 of the Sherman Act is available for the exceptions. Toadying to uninformed populist fears of vertical integration between network providers and content creators by imposing investment-dampening ex ante regulatory constraints is likely to be far less useful to the public than are steps to ensure effective competition among network providers.",

Both vertical integration and changes in the extent of vertical integration are benign characteristics of efficient, dynamic, competitive markets. While there is no shortage of theoretical models in which vertical integration may be harmful, most such models have restrictive assumptions and ambiguous welfare predictions-even when market power is assumed to be present. Empirical evidence that vertical integration or vertical restraints are harmful is weak, compared to evidence that vertical integration is beneficial-again, even in cases where market power appears to be present. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that prophylactic regulation is not necessary, and may well reduce welfare.

In the 1992 Kodak case, for example, the court required an evidentiary showing that customers do not act irrationally when purchasing OEM equipment from OEM suppliers of aftermarket services. Many economists would see this inquiry as unnecessary, at least for commercial buyers. But seeGoldfine and Vorrasi (2004), arguing that the lower courts have resistedKodak.   ",
