            "text": "To determine the sequence specificity of dimeric Ss-LrpB, a high resolution contact map was constructed and a saturation mutagenesis conducted on one half of the palindromic consensus box. Premodification binding interference indicates that Ss-LrpB establishes most of its tightest contacts with a single strand of two major groove segments and interacts with the minor groove at the center of the box. The requirement for bending is reflected in the preference for an A+T rich center and confirmed with C\u2022G and C\u2022I substitutions. The saturation mutagenesis indicates that major groove contacts with C\u2022G at position 5 and its symmetrical counterpart are most critical for the specificity and strength of the interaction. Conservation at the remaining positions improved the binding. Hydrogen bonding to the O 6 and N 7 acceptor atoms of the G 5 0 residue play a major role in complex formation. Unlike many other DNA-binding proteins Ss-LrpB does not establish hydrophobic interactions with the methyls of thymine residues. The binding energies determined from the saturation mutagenesis were used to construct a sequence logo, which pinpoints the overwhelming importance of C\u2022G at position 5. The knowledge of the DNA-binding specificity will constitute a precious tool for the search of new physiologically relevant binding sites for Ss-LrpB in the genome.",

In vivo any sequence-specific DNAbinding protein will also bind to pseudo-sites with a reduced affinity. These pseudo-sites nevertheless play an important role both thermodynamically, by setting the concentration of freely available regulatory protein and kinetically, by regulating the rate of location of the specific targets. Furthermore, low affinity sites may have a considerable impact on the outcome of the regulatory response if they occur in proper juxtaposition with a high affinity site and are bound in a cooperative fashion. A detailed knowledge of the sequence specificity is therefore required to search for new binding sites and to distinguish between physiologically relevant regulatory sites and pseudo-sites.",

The lack of efficient tools in genetics and molecular biology, especially for hyperthermophilic archaea, constitutes a severe limitation for the analysis of regulator function and the identification of regulons, modulons and stimulons. Nevertheless, the (potential) binding sites of a handful archaeal regulators have been identified in upstream promotor/operator regions of their respective target genes through in silico or experimental approaches (in vitro or more rarely in vivo) [for a review on archaeal transcription regulation, see Ref. (1)]. Most of these sites are semi-palindromic.",

Lrp-like regulators are widely distributed among archaea, but with the exception of LysM from Sulfolobus solfataricus, the physiological role of these potential regulators in archaea remains mainly elusive (3). Lrp-like proteins show a variable degree of amino acid sequence identity, but share the same fundamental architecture. Crystal structure determination has been done for the archaeal members LrpA (4) and FL11 (5), both from Pyrococcus species and for the bacterial members LrpC from Bacillus subtilis and AsnC from Escherichia coli (6). The N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain is connected with a flexible linker to the C-terminal domain that shows a typical ab sandwich fold, also called RAM domain (regulation of amino acid metabolism) (7). The latter is involved in effector binding and oligomerization. In solution, Lrp proteins exist as dimers or oligomers of dimers. They usually bind cooperatively to operators carrying an array of degenerate semi-palindromic targets (2).",

            "text": "The DNA-binding sequence specificity of a regulator can be determined by using the SELEX strategy (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) (10). This technique will select a set of high affinity DNA sites that define a consensus-binding sequence for the protein. It has been applied for the Lrp-like regulators E.coli Lrp and Ptr1 and Ptr2 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (11,12). In the present study we have followed another strategy. We determined the DNA-binding sequence specificity of Ss-LrpB by measuring the in vitro binding to a set of mutated variants of the idealized symmetrical consensus box. This was done systematically for all possible single base pair substitutions of one half of the binding site (saturation mutagenesis) and also for targets containing an abasic position or a non-canonical base: inosine, uracil, 5-methyl cytosine or 2-aminopurine. The importance of the spacing between the two consensus-half-sites was assessed by including single and double base pair deletions and insertions. Binding profiles were constructed based on electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments, allowing an estimation of the apparent binding equilibrium dissociation constants (K D ). The quantitative binding data from the saturation mutants were represented in an energy normalized sequence logo (13,14). Combined with the results of a high resolution contact probing analysis of the Ss-LrpB:consensus box interaction, this provides a detailed view of how each base pair energetically contributes to the specific binding. Such an extended and detailed experimental analysis had not yet been performed for an archaeal regulator or a bacterial/ archaeal Lrp-like regulator.",

Here, the study of this interaction is extended by enzymatic and chemical footprinting and by premodification binding interference assays ( Figure 1). Ss-LrpB protected on both strands a 22 nt long stretch against DNase I cleavage. This stretch covers the 15-bp consensus box and extends 5 nt towards the 3 0 end and 2 nt towards the 5 0 end (Figure 1a and f). Protection on both strands is therefore offset by 3 nt towards the 3 0 end; this reflects how DNase I is positioned in the minor groove and cleaves phosphodiester bonds on opposing strands across the minor groove. The presence of hyperreactive sites at the 3 0 -boundaries of the consensus box are indicative of Ss-LrpB-induced DNA deformations resulting in local minor groove widening. The limits of protection areas and the sites of reactivity and hyperreactivity are fully symmetrical ( Figure 1f). This indicates that specific binding results in the alignment of the 2-fold symmetry of the Ss-LrpB dimer to the dyad axis of symmetry of the palindromic binding site.",

This resulted in a protection area that is on both strands limited to the 15-bp consensus sequence (Figure 1b and f). Remarkably, in the DNase I and in-gel footprinting experiments the bare DNA showed little cleavage activity in the consensus box whereas the flanking sequences were cleaved more efficiently. This heterogeneity in the sensitivity to both the enzymatic and the chemical nuclease reflects local conformational variations of the DNA and suggests a narrowing of the minor groove in the A+T rich (73.3%) consensus-binding site (20,21).",

These techniques are based on the creation of a pool of DNA molecules with on average one base-specific modification per molecule. Low and high affinity molecules are subsequently separated in an EMSA designed to result in $50% binding. Free and bound DNA are recovered from the gel, cleaved at the site of modification and analyzed by gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions to distinguish positions that are crucial for binding from sites that are irrelevant (see Materials and Methods). Experimental results are shown for the top strand only ( Figure 1c-e); a summary of all the effects is given in Figure 1f and in a helical presentation in Figure 1g. Methylation of the N 7 atom (major groove) of any of four guanine residues (at the adjacent positions 4, 5 0 and the symmetrical counterparts \u00c04 0 , \u00c05) strongly inhibited complex formation (Figure 1c and f) indicating that Ss-LrpB makes strong major groove contacts with these parts of the binding site ( Figure 1g). The methylation of the N 3 atom (minor groove) of 12 adenine residues (positions 0, 1 0 , 2 0 , 3 0 , 6, 7 and the symmetrical counterparts) resulted in a weaker but significant interference (Figure 1c and f). A similar effect was observed at two symmetrically related adenine residues juxtaposing the 15-bp target. These results suggest local minor groove contacts, mainly in the central part of the binding site and near its extremities (Figure 1g), though it can not be excluded that some effects might be indirect and result from subtle local alterations of the helix induced by the methyl group.",

            "text": "Base removal binding interference effects (missing contact) are usually considered to represent direct effects, which imply that they reflect interactions established between these bases and the interacting protein molecule (22). Alternatively, indirect effects might occur owing to structural alterations or changes in the DNA conformability generated by the absence of a base (8,23). Based on the observed effects ( Figure 1d-g) it can be concluded that the vast majority of the purine and pyrimidine residues of the consensus box contribute to Ss-LrpB binding. On the top strand the strongest effects were observed upon removal of G \u00c05 and any adenine of the stretch A \u00c03 -A 0 and of T \u00c07 , T \u00c06 , T 1 , T 2 and T 3 . Removal of the adenine 5 0 to the consensus box also interfered with Ss-LrpB binding. Weaker effects were observed upon removal of G 4 , C 5 and A 6 . In contrast, the removal of C \u00c04 and A 7 hardly affected complex formation. Therefore the inhibitory effect of premethylation of residue A 7 is likely indirect since it occurs in the minor groove, on the backside of the DNA molecule. The effects observed upon removal of residues of the lower strand provided essentially the symmetrical image of the results on the top strand (Figure 1f and g). It appears that Ss-LrpB establishes the vast majority of its tightest major groove contacts with one single strand segment in each half-site (Figure 1f and g). Generally, the results of the footprinting and missing contact probing assays performed with the consensus box are in good agreement with the results obtained previously with the array of three degenerate binding sites in the Ss-lrpB control region (8).",

The annealing of complementary oligonucleotides allowed to study in identical conditions all the substitution mutants, the abasic molecules and molecules carrying a non-canonical base. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of the interaction was determined by applying the EMSA technique ( Figure 2). This was done by quantitating the free DNA population by densitometry and plotting the fraction of bound DNA versus the concentration of Ss-LrpB. As demonstrated previously, the EMSA can provide estimates of the macroscopic binding constants of protein-DNA interactions (25). The construction of a binding profile by fitting the Hill equation allowed us to determine the apparent K D as the protein concentration required to shift a DNA fraction of 0.5. This also allowed us to determine the Hill coefficient, which is a measure of binding cooperativity. The affinity of binding to the 45-bp consensus duplex (K D of 91 nM) was $3-fold lower than binding to a 150-bp DNA fragment bearing the same consensus-binding site (K D of 33 nM) ( Figure 2 and Table 1). Similar differences in binding affinity depending on the length of the flanking sequence have been observed in other studies (26). Footprinting experiments (DNase I and in-gel Cu-OP) clearly indicate that the 150-bp fragment does not assemble >1 Ss-LrpB dimer. Therefore, the most plausible explanation of the size effect is that the flanking sequences provide 105 non-specific sites that contribute the equivalent of two specific sites. Furthermore, accelerated targeting by 1D diffusion along the DNA molecule and the possibility of having different dissociation rates from internal sites and the ends of the fragments may add to the observed differences in binding affinity to the 105-and 45-bp fragments (27).",

Given the more extensive reorganization of potential hydrogen bonding groups when substituting T\u2022A as compared with A\u2022T for C\u2022G (Figure 3a-d) one might have expected the latter to be the less detrimental change. The opposite was observed: this appears to be due to a position-dependent inhibitory effect of the hydrophobic methyl group of thymine, as demonstrated with the use of uracil and 5-methyl cytosine substitutions (Figure 5a and b; Table 2). Uracil is equivalent to thymine but lacks the C 5 methyl group on the major groove side of the base. Binding to the A\u2022U mutant [7.1-fold increase in K D as compared with wild type (WT)] was much better than to the A\u2022T mutant (>170-fold increase in K D ) and comparable with the T\u2022A mutant (8.9-fold increase). The substitution of C 5 by 5-methyl cytosine (C Me ), keeping the complementary G 5 0 residue intact, resulted only in a 2-fold increase in the K D .

Therefore, the C\u2022G base pair at position 5 and its symmetrical counterpart might very well be contacted by the side chain of one or more arginine residues of the recognition helix of Ss-LrpB. Ss-LrpB bears three arginine residues in its recognition helix, at positions 42, 44 and 47. Of these, R 44 is highly conserved among Lrp-like regulators. Alanine substitution of these residues might provide further molecular details on the interaction of Ss-LrpB with position 5 of the binding site.

This reflects the fact that a protein can hardly distinguish a T\u2022A base pair from an A\u2022T base pair on the minor groove side since their hydrogen bond acceptor groups (C 2 carbonyl from T and N 3 of A) will roughly switch positions. The effect of the A\u2022T to T\u2022A transversion was smallest at the central position 0 (1.2-fold increase in K D ). In fact, this base pair substitution leaves the 15-bp consensus box unchanged; it simply corresponds to reading the opposite strand. Therefore, the observed 1.2-fold difference in binding affinities reflects the experimental error and is within the error range observed in the EMSAs (see Materials and Methods).

The apparent prohibition of strong base pair might be related to the exocyclic C 2 -amino group of guanine, which plays a dual role in DNA structure and recognition. The introduction of an NH 2 group in the minor groove results in groove widening and consequently in a decrease of the electronegative potential as compared with weak base pairs. It also constitutes a steric hindrance for the compression of the minor groove upon bending of the operator DNA towards the interacting Ss-LrpB molecule (8,9). The need for bending of an operator site is generally reflected in the fact that there is a preference for A+T rich sequences at the midpoint of the target, where the minor groove has to be narrow. To evaluate the influence of the C 2 -amino group of guanine upon substitution of strong base pairs for A\u2022T and T\u2022A in the minor groove we measured complex formation with a pair of double base pair substitutions carrying G\u2022C and C\u2022G (positions \u00c01 and 1, respectively) and the equivalent construct carrying inosine instead of guanine (Table 3). Inosine lacks the C 2 -amino group of guanine on the minor groove side of the base and is also equivalent to C 6 -deaminated adenine. Therefore an I\u2022C pair resembles an A\u2022T pair in the minor groove and a G\u2022C pair in the major groove. The double guanine-bearing mutant exhibited an $7-fold reduction in the relative binding affinity compared with the WT; a similar effect was observed in a double G\u2022C for A\u2022T substitution at positions 0 and 1 ( Table 3). In contrast, the inosine bearing double mutant showed a 1.6-fold increase in K D , only. Therefore, inosine interferes significantly less with complex formation than guanine. This result emphasizes the importance of minor groove geometry in the central part of the Ss-LrpB binding site.",

            "text": "To examine the importance of the alignment of the two half-sites of the consensus box contacted through the major groove we studied the binding to insertion and deletion mutants (Table 4). These mutants had an insertion or deletion of either 1 or 2 bp in the A+T rich central segment contacted through the minor groove. The insertion of one extra T\u2022A base pair (ins1: in the stretch T 1 -T 3 ) still allowed the formation of the specific complex, though with a 3.3-fold increase of the K D as compared with the WT. In contrast, deleting a single A\u2022T base pair (del1: in the stretch of A \u00c03 -A 0 ) completely abolished Ss-LrpB binding (K D > 11 000 nM; Table 4). A similar result was observed with a double base pair deletion mutant (A\u2022T and T\u2022A). A double base pair insertion mutant (consecutive A\u2022T and T\u2022A base pairs in the center of the box) resulted in a specific binding with a 11.8-fold increased K D . These results indicate a limited conformational flexibility of the Ss-LrpB dimer. Increasing the separation between the two half-sites contacted through the major groove, thereby disturbing the helical alignment, is tolerated to a certain extent. In contrast, reducing their separation (thereby inducing a similar rotation of $34 per base pair but in the opposite direction) is highly detrimental. These results suggest that steric hindrance between the two subunits of the Ss-LrpB dimer might exclude the simultaneous binding of their HTH motives to the unproperly aligned major groove segments of the deletion mutants.",

            "text": "DNA-binding sequence motifs can be graphically represented by sequence logos, based on the information theory (13). The height of the stack of letters corresponds to the sequence conservation, expressed in bits of information. The relative heights of the bases correspond to their relative frequencies. Therefore, a sequence logo provides more information than a consensus sequence. Here, we generated two kinds of logos with a web interface called enoLOGOS: (i) based on sequence comparisons, (ii) based on binding energies (Figure 6a and b; 14). A sequence logo was constructed based on the three binding sites for Ss-LrpB in the control region of its own gene (Figure 6a; 8). An alignment of both forward and reverse sequences was used since Ss-LrpB binds as a dimer. Two corrections were applied in the creation of this logo: (i) A small-sample correction, since the information content tends to be overestimated in the case of a small dataset. (ii) A correction for background base frequencies in the case of genomes with a biased GC content such as S.solfataricus (GC content of 37%). The Ss-LrpB sequence logo confirms our previously deduced consensus sequence. Conservation is higher in the major groove contacted halfsites than in the A+T rich center. However, since only three binding sites have been used to create the logo, its significance is rather low. In contrast, the saturation mutagenesis dataset used to create an energy normalized sequence logo is much larger and therefore more significant (Figure 6b). Full symmetry was assumed to construct the logo for the complete 15-bp binding site. The correction for the biased GC content was not applied since it is irrelevant in this case. Compared with the logo based on the natural targets, this 'enologo' has a higher resolution. The relative importance of a C at position 5 (and G at position \u00c05) is highly emphasized. A cosine wave represents the twist of the DNA helix. Positions recognized in the minor groove have a maximal information content of 1 bit as opposed to 2 bits in the major groove (29). This is explained by the fact that in the minor groove a protein cannot discriminate weak base pairs from each other or strong base pairs from each other. Binding of the C 5 \u2022G 5 0 base pair in the major groove is confirmed since the information content exceeds 1. On the contrary, based on our binding affinity data, the sequence in the minor groove is relatively less important. This is certainly the case for positions \u00c01, 0 and 1, where little sequence preference is indicated in the logo. The total information content of this enologo is 7.2 bits as compared with 10.4 for the sequence logo based on the natural binding sites.",

Assuming additivity, which is usually a good approximation in order to find new sites (30), the binding affinity of each sequence can be predicted. Nevertheless, setting the threshold such that relevant high affinity sites are retrieved and the amount of false positives is minimalized, is a delicate and not so straightforward process. The algorithm will be designed to allow an extra 1 or 2 bp in the center of the box. The joint occurence of high and low affinity sites should also be considered. When correctly aligned the latter will be bound in a cooperative manner and consequently acquire a physiological role, as already demonstrated by the concentration-dependent formation of structurally very different complexes of Ss-LrpB with the control region of its own gene (9).",
