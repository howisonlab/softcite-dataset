Michigan (MI) cystic fibrosis (CF) centers' QNS rates were 12% to 25% in 2009. This project was initiated to reduce sweat QNS rates in MI. Methods/Steps. (a) Each center's sweat testing procedures were reviewed by a consultant. (b) Each center received a report with recommendations to improve QNS rates. (c) Technicians visited other participating centers to observe their procedures. Results. A total of 778 infants were identified as positive via CF newborn screening over a 2-year period. The mean age at time of sweat test was 23.2 days (SD \u00b1 13.0 days). The overall QNS percent decreased from 14.4% to 9.5% (P = .04) during the study. Conclusion. This project and teamwork approach led to a decrease of sweat test QNS rates, opportunities to solve a common problem, and improved quality of care."

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common lifethreatening inherited diseases with a prevalence of about 1 in 3500 live births. 1 Newborn screening (NBS) for CF has now been implemented in all the states in the United States and in many countries worldwide. Infants as young as 1 week of age with positive NBS for CF are routinely referred to accredited CF centers for sweat testing to confirm the diagnosis. 2,3 Sweat collection requires sweat gland stimulation with pilocarpine iontophoresis and collection of sweat via Gibson and Cook technique (GCT) or Macroduct Sweat Collection System (MSCS; Wescor, Logan, UT). 2,4 For adequate sweat samples, the collected sweat must be \u226575 mg (via GCT) or \u226515 \u00b5L (via MSCS). 2 Lower weights or volumes of sweat specimens cannot be analyzed and are labeled as \"quantity not sufficient\" (QNS). 3,4 One recent study compared the performance of the MSCS to the GCT in determining the sweat testing QNS rate in infants with a positive CF NBS over a period of 4 years in Minnesota. 5 This report found a higher QNS rate using the GCT compared to the MSCS (15.4% vs 2.1% respectively). 5 Younger infants are more likely to produce a higher QNS rate than older children. 6,7 Accordingly, infants with QNS samples need repeat testing, which leads to increased time to diagnosis, additional stress to the infants and their families, and an extra cost for testing. 8 Currently, the cost of sweat testing is approximately $500 per test. The CF Foundation has placed a great importance on minimizing QNS rates and established several guidelines to standardize performance of sweat testing. The recommended QNS rate for children older than 3 months of age is \u22645%. 2,3 Since younger infants are being increasingly referred for sweat testing via the CF NBS programs, the CF Foundation added a standard stipulation of QNS rate \u226410% for patients \u22643 months of age, 3,4 a goal many centers struggle to meet.",

Blood spots from infants having an IRT concentration \u226596th percentile undergo further analysis with a panel of 40 CF gene mutations. Infants with one or more DNA mutations are referred to 1 of 5 CF Foundationaccredited care centers in Michigan for confirmatory sweat testing. Three hundred and fifteen infants born in 2008 underwent sweat testing at a mean age of 26 days. 9 Of the 315 infants, 63 (20%) had QNS results, with the center-specific rates ranging from 12% to 30%. 9 A literature search comparing the QNS rates in Michigan to the QNS rates of other state NBS programs revealed only 2 studies that listed QNS rates from a population of infants in the United States referred for confirmatory sweat testing following a positive newborn screen. 3,7 Massachusetts reported the QNS rate ranged from 3% to 17% for sweat tests conducted during the first 8 weeks of life. 7 Illinois had a QNS rate of 10% with a median age at sweat test of 22 days for those with sufficient tests and 17 days for those with insufficient tests. 3 LeGrys et al reported summary QNS rates for infants \u22643 months of age of 7% from a national survey of CF care centers and 8% from a survey of state leaders involved in NBS, though the sitespecific QNS rates displayed wide variability. 3 Many reports have examined the association between specific characteristics and QNS results focusing either on a single infant characteristic or a combination of infant factors. 6,7,[9][10][11][12][13] We previously conducted a study using a population-based cohort of all infants identified by NBS in Michigan and referred for confirmatory sweat testing to evaluate predictors of QNS rate and to devise a quality improvement (QI) strategy to reduce the QNS rate in neonates during confirmatory testing in order to meet the CF Foundation guidelines. 9 The study found that corrected age at the time of sweat test, defined by summing gestational age and postdelivery age at the time of test, should be considered when determining the appropriate time to perform a sweat test. As a result of this study, Michigan's NBS Program adjusted its CF algorithm to wait until infants screening positive for CF reach 39 weeks of corrected age prior to sweat testing in order to reduce the QNS rate. 9 Our current QI study looked at different ways to reduce sweat testing QNS rate among infants \u22643 months of age. To our knowledge, this is the first populationbased cohort study to evaluate sweat testing QNS rates before and after implementation of several recommendations for improvement.",

Four CF Foundation accredited care centers in Michigan participated directly in this QI study (Centers A-D). Each of the 4 participating CF centers reviewed its QNS rate and the sweat testing procedure as outlined by the CF Foundation Guidelines. CF care centers in Michigan employ 2 different methods of sweat testing. One center uses GCT, whereas 3 centers use the MSCS. Both methods were equally recommended for appropriate collection of sweat samples from subjects of all age groups including newborns. 2 A clinical laboratory consultant with expertise in sweat testing was invited to visit each center. The expert reviewed the sweat test procedure at each center and provided suggestions for improvement on techniques, methods of collection, and analysis of the collected sweat samples. A list of best practice recommendations from the expert was provided to the participating CF Care Centers to improve the sweat testing techniques. The steps that were implemented by each center were noted, as well as the date implemented. Information from site visits at all 4 centers was collected, and helpful steps in lowering QNS rates shared.",

Using the Macroduct system, CAP-certified technicians cleaned the area to be tested with water, inserted a new pilogel disc at each electrode, secured electrodes to the newborn's limb, and applied 1.5 A of current for 5 minutes. After removing the electrodes, the Macroduct sweat collection coil was secured to the area of the positive electrode for 30 minutes. If the sweat retention capacity of the coils was exceeded before 30 minutes, collection was stopped when the coils were full. When a patient did not produce a sweat sample of 15 \u00b5L, the attempt was counted as QNS. When using the Gibson-Cooke Apparatus, 2 electrodes were each covered by a 2 \u00d7 2 inch gauze pad soaked in 2 to 3 mL of 0.4% pilocarpine nitrate at the positive electrode, and a current of 2 to 3 mA was applied for 5 minutes.

To allow for time for the recommended changes to be implemented, QNS rates were determined for 2 time periods: 6 months after the visit and the subsequent 12 months. The average age at time of sweat test overall and by NICU status were calculated for each center, and t-tests were used to test for significant differences in the 18-month period following the site visit compared to the 18-month period before the visit.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics for all patients who received a sweat test in the 18 months before and after the site visit at each of the centers. The QNS percent significantly differed by gestational age, birth weight, NICU admission, and CF Care Center, but did not significantly differ by race. The QNS percent was approximately 2 to 4 times greater among those who were <39 weeks or <2000 g compared to their counterparts.

The overall QNS rate was significantly reduced from 14.4% in the 18 months prior to the site visits by a clinical laboratory expert to 9.5% in the 18 months following the visits. Reducing the QNS sweat testing rate is important not only to adhere to the CF Foundation guidelines 3,4 but also to expedite completion of the screening process, thereby reducing associated parental anxiety and confusion regarding results. 14  Missing data are as follows: race (n = 36), gestational age (n = 27), birth weight (n = 9).
