RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdPatients were randomized to subcutaneous (SC) EQW 2.0 mg + oral placebo (n = 248), MET 2,000 mg/day + SC placebo (n = 246), PIO 45 mg/day + SC placebo (n = 163), or SITA 100 mg/day + SC placebo (n = 163) for 26 weeks. MET and PIO therapies were increased to maximum-tolerated dosages. Injections with EQW or placebo were administered weekly, while oral medication or placebo was administered daily. RESULTSdBaseline characteristics were as follows: 59% men, 67% Caucasian, mean age 54 years, HbA 1c 8.5%, fasting serum glucose 9.9 mmol/L, body weight 87.0 kg, and diabetes duration 2.7 years.

Common adjunctive treatments not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy include the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone (PIO), the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin (SITA), and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist exenatide twice daily (BID) (2)(3)(4)(5). PIO and exenatide BID are included in the second tier (less well-validated) of preferred agents in the ADA/EASD algorithm. SITA is not indentified, but may be an appropriate choice for selected patients (1). These agents, commonly used only in MET-intolerant patients as monotherapy, have unique risks, benefits, and mechanisms.",

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of EQW monotherapy, in comparison with MET, PIO, and SITA monotherapy, in drug-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. Treatment with EQW, MET, and PIO all resulted in improvements in glycemic control, achieving mean HbA 1c concentrations at 26 weeks of ,7%. EQW demonstrated superiority to SITA and noninferiority to MET but not to PIO with regard to HbA 1c reduction at 26 weeks. The lack of noninferiority of EQW monotherapy compared with PIO monotherapy was unexpected based on DURATION-2 study results, where EQW was superior to PIO on a background of MET (10), and the fact that the HbA 1c reduction with PIO was greater than that reported in other PIO studies with a similar baseline HbA 1c (2,3,(11)(12)(13)(14). Several disparate factors could have contributed to the incongruent outcomes, including differences in background therapy and mean duration of type 2 diabetes.",

The similar effects obtained with EQW monotherapy and MET monotherapy in terms of HbA 1c and body weight reductions support the appropriateness of considering MET as the first-line antihyperglycemic agent in type 2 diabetes. For example, the ADA/ EASD recommends MET as a first-line agent; other antihyperglycemic agents are added in stepwise fashion with disease progression after MET failure (1). Findings from DURATION-4 demonstrate that both EQW and PIO offer similar improvements in glycemia as MET, with one key difference between these agents being the effect on body weight.

Similar to previous studies evaluating PIO as monotherapy (3,13), patients treated with PIO in the current study gained weight. EQW and MET led to similar significant reductions in body weight after 26 weeks, whereas SITA led to a lesser reduction. Although variability based on study design and patient characteristics was expected, weight reduction observed in this study with EQW was on the lower end of the range (22.0 to 23.7 kg) observed in previous DURATION studies (6,7,10,17). Conversely, reductions observed with SITA and MET in the current study tended to be greater than results from meta-analyses and recent monotherapy trials of similar duration (5,(18)(19)(20). The potential for improvements in HbA 1c and body weight in studies with placebo injection therapy has been noted in a previous study of exenatide therapy (21). These data show that EQW and MET provided the best profile in terms of improving glycemic control as well as reducing weight, without increased risk of hypoglycemia, particularly important for treatment of overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes.",

            "text": "The findings with respect to safety and tolerability were consistent with previous studies, including the observance of gastrointestinal adverse events in patients treated with EQW and MET, and hypertension and peripheral edema with PIO (3,5,6,10,17,20,(22)(23)(24). Most notably, the safety profile of EQW in the current trial was consistent with previous DURA-TION studies (6,10,17), with low rates of confirmed minor hypoglycemia and few patients discontinuing treatment due to nausea (one patient) and vomiting (zero patients). Less nausea and vomiting with EQW have previously been reported in head-to-head studies versus exenatide BID. In general, hypoglycemia incidence and incidence of serious adverse events were low across all treatment groups during the current study. The small percentage (2%) of patients experiencing minor hypoglycemia with EQW monotherapy was similar to that observed with EQW adjunct to MET in previous clinical trials (0-3%) (6,7,10,17). Most treatmentemergent adverse events in this study had resolved by the end of the 10-week safety follow-up period, with few treatmentemergent adverse events starting during the safety follow-up. There were several limitations to this study. First, patients were enrolled based on specific criteria and were followed according to the study schedule, which may not reflect real-world use. Second, no specific compliance data were collected; however, patient-reported outcomes indicated that both oral and injectable therapies were associated with increases in treatment satisfaction and quality of life in these previously drug-naive patients. Additionally, 26 weeks is too short a study duration to evaluate long-term glycemic control, weight loss, and b-cell preservation (25). For example, potential implications of the upward shift in HbA 1c , observed in the EQW group between weeks 16 and 26 ( Fig. 2A), cannot be assessed further without additional data points.",

This study recognizes that guidelines typically recommend MET as the first agent used, because it is inexpensive and supported by long-term data. Of the agents studied, EQW and MET provided similar improvements in glycemic control along with the benefit of weight reduction and no increased risk of hypoglycemia. There were no unexpected findings with regard to safety or tolerability. Based on these 26-week data, EQW is a onceweekly dosing option for initial therapy. Longer-term studies will be required to assess the durability of the observations in this study.",
