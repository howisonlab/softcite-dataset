Marandu pasture receiving four levels of glycerin in their supplementation. Thirty-six crossbred heifers with average initial weight of 264.83\u00b13.83 kg and 20 months of age were distributed into a completely randomized design with four treatments and nine replications: control (0%), 4.82%, 10.12%, and 15.56% glycerin in the dry matter. The grazing time reduced linearly (p<0.05), whereas the time spent on activities like rumination, idleness, trough and total chewing time were quadratically affected (p<0.05). Bite rate and number of bites/day were quadratically influenced (p<0.05). The number of bites/swallowed cud and the number of bites/minute, however, increased linearly (p<0.05). Although the time spent on each cud and number of chews per cud were not affected (p>0.05).The number of rumination periods reduced linearly (p<0.05), whereas the number of grazing, idle and trough periods, and the times per grazing, idle, rumination and trough periods were quadratically affected (p<0.05). The feed and rumination efficiencies of the dry matter, non-fibrous carbohydrates, pasture dry matter and concentrate were quadratically affected (p>0.05) whereas the feed efficiency of neutral detergent fiber reduced linearly (p<0.05). Addition of glycerin in substitution of corn in supplements for animals managed on pastures does not influenced feed intake, but reduces the grazing time and increases the idle time. The supplementation also improves feed and rumination efficiencies.",

            "text": "The performance of animals managed on pasture is directly related to the quantitative and qualitative availability of forage, which is subjected to variations throughout the year. Thus, strategic supplementation is an alternative to improve productive efficiency through providing the limiting nutrients to achieve the objectives of the production system. Nutrient intake, digestibility and metabolism are factors that affect animal performance, however feed intake, can be influenced by factors inherent to the feeds such as palatability, texture, visual appearance, and factors linked to the animals, like emotional state, social interaction and apprenticeship (Mertens, 1994). The effect of supplement on intake can be additive, when the supplement intake is aggregated to the current ingestion of the animal; and substitutive, when the supplement intake reduces forage intake without improving animal performance (Barbosa et al., 2001). Additionally, the ingestion of supplement changes the ingestive behavior of grazing ruminants (Marques et al, 2005) and when part of the required nutrients is met by supplement intake, the efficiency in the use of the energy from the diet may improve due to the better conditions for the activity of the ruminal microbiota (Silva et al, 2005). Thus, the grazing time may reduce, the idle and rumination times may increase and the feed intake by the animals may improve. Therefore, the ingestive behavior can be influenced according to the type of ingredient used in the supplement. Additionally, the physical structure and chemical composition can also affect the ingestive behavior, influencing the feeding time.",

Hence, alternative energy sources can be efficient in reducing the production costs provided they do not compromise intake or animal performance. Among the alternative sources of food energy is glycerin, a by-product from the biodiesel industry, which has been used in supplementation systems as a substitute for corn, because it presents similar energy characteristics and also because ruminants are able to use the glycerol present in the glycerin as a gluconeogenic precursor (Chung et al., 2007) for the maintenance of plasma glucose levels.",

The supplement was provided once daily (10 00 h) in an uncovered plastic trough. The diets were formulated according to the NRC (2000) to contain equal amounts of protein and energy (Tables 1 and 2), with a roughage-toconcentrate ratio of 63.40:36.6. The glycerin utilized was produced in a soybean biodiesel-extracting company (BIOPAR, Rol\u00e2ndia, PR, Brazil) and contained 81.20% glycerol. The chemical composition of glycerin was determined at Instituto de Tecnologia do Paran\u00e1 (TECPAR).  The pasture was evaluated every 28 days to estimate the DM availability (Table 2) by removing 12 samples collected from the soil level with a 0.25 m 2 frame according to the method described by Wilm et al. (1944). To reduce the influence of biomass variation among paddocks, the heifers remained in each paddock for seven days, and then randomly transferred to another paddock. The daily residual biomass of DM (Table 2) was estimated in the four paddocks according to the double-sampling method (Wilm et al., 1994). Before the cut, the DM of the biomass of the sample was visually estimated. The values of the visually estimated samples cut when the frame was thrown 40 times were utilized, and subsequently the forage biomass was calculated and expressed in kg/ha, by the equation proposed by Gardner (1986).",

(2009), glycerol is almost totally converted to propionate in the rumen, which is the first to signal the end of the meals by increasing adenosine triphosphate production due to its use for glucose production, which signals satiety (Krehbiel, 2008). Thus, because 91% of the glycerin utilized in this experiment consisted of glycerol, a momentary satiation can be observed, caused by the rapid energy uptake, thereby increasing the idle time by the animals.",

The variation in rumination time can be attributed to the Table 3. Effect of addition of glycerin levels on nutrient intake and times spent on the grazing, idle, rumination and trough activities by supplemented heifers on a Brachiaria brizantha pasture  exclusive nature of each activity performed by an animal, therefore two activites cannot to be performed at the same time. In the present study, the rumination time was inversely proportional to the time the animals remained idle. Another explanation for the variation observed in grazing time is that the formation of cuds is proportional to the grazing time (Bremm et al., 2008). Under similar conditions to those of the present experiment, Farias et al. 2012did not observe an effect of increasing levels of glycerin on the rumination time of heifers reared on pasture. Silva et al. (2005) also did not observe changes in the rumination time of supplemented grazing heifers. The time eating at the trough (trough; Table 3) was also quadratically affected (p<0.05): with 8.8% addition of glycerin to the diet, the animals remained approximately 53 minutes at the trough. This result is in line with the observation of Farias et al. (2012), who added 2.8%, 6.1%, and 9.1% glycerin to the diet of supplemented heifers on Brachiaria brizantha pasture. According to these authors, the increase in trough time with up to 6.1% of addition of glycerin to the diet was due to the difficulty shown by the animals to adapt to the glycerin. However, in the present study, it was observed that this adaptation difficulty occurred until glycerin reached 10% of the diet. After a certain level of ingestion, the animals would be used to the sweet taste of glycerin, which promoted rapid ingestion of the concentrate. We must stress that even with reduction of trough time with 15% of glycerin, concentrate intake was not lower. On the other hand, for Elam et al. (2008), addition of glycerin to the concentrate increased the time of permanence at the trough, due to the substitution of the time intended for grazing or rumination with the ingestion of concentrate (Bremm et al., 2005;Bremm et al., 2008).",

On the other hand, the number of cuds per day (cuds/d) was quadratically affected (p<0.05), and with 6.8% glycerin the animals increased the number of cuds to 289.1, indicating a greater need to form cuds to be chewed. Once the cud was formed, the average chewing time was similar (p>0.05) among the levels of replacement of corn by glycerin. The average number of chews/cud (46.05) was similar to that observed by Silva et al. (2005), who supplied different levels of supplement to heifers on a Brachiaria decumbens pasture. Farias et al. (2012), on the other hand, observed quadratic effect on the same variable, adding crude glycerin to the diet of supplemented heifers on a Brachiaria brizantha pasture. Quadratic effect (p<0.05) was observed on the number of periods of the activities performed by the heifers, with increments of 0.12 grazing periods (NGP), 11.59 idle periods (NIP) and 4.41 periods at the trough (NTP) with addition of 2.97%, 11.59%, and 8.14% glycerin to the diet, respectively. These results indicate that although there was reduction in the total grazing time (Table 3) and a trend towards reduction in NGP with levels of addition above 3% (Table 6), no reduction in pasture DM intake was observed (Table 3), which indicates that the animals utilized other behavioral elements to maintain the DM intake. However, addition of glycerin to the diet linearly reduced the number of rumination periods (NRP), which indicates that glycerin inclusion may affect both the total time (Table 3) and the number of rumination periods (Table 6) in a similar way. However, Farias et al. (2012) reported that both the duration (time) and number of rumination periods are affected by other types of mechanisms and not by the glycerin levels.",

Likewise, the time per idle period was quadratically affected (p<0.05) therefore, with addition of 5.27% glycerin the animals spent the least time idle (20.8 min) ( Table 6).

In this case, the linear decrease in NRP was not sufficient to determine the total rumination time of heifers, in min/d (Table 3).

Thus, we can infer that levels similar to those utilized in this study did not impair forage intake.",

Glycerin supplementation also improves the use of DM and neutral detergent fiber from pasture and concentrate through the better feed and rumination efficiencies.",
