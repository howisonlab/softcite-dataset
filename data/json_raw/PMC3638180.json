In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used to examine the experience of the actors and stakeholders participating in the design and implementation of EHRs. Results indicate that the main driving force behind the use of EHRs was to improve reporting to the two of the main government health and social development programs. Significant challenges to the success of the EHR include resistance by physicians to use the ICD-10 to code diagnoses, insufficient attention to recurrent resources needed to maintain the system, and pressure from federal programs to establish parallel information systems. Operating funds and more importantly political commitment are required to ensure sustainability of the EHRs in Colimaima.",

            "text": "The electronic health record (EHR) is a tool with the potential to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health services. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] It can also provide data for assessing the health status of the population and the performance of the health system itself. 10 11 Many countries in the developing world are considering EHR adoption. 12 In Mexico, different public and private healthcare institutions have adopted EHRs, including Mexico's Social Security Institute, 13 the Institute for Social Security and Services for Government Employees, and the health services of several states and many private hospitals. As part of the national strategy for monitoring and improving the quality, functionality, and interoperability of EHRs in Mexico, in 2010 the General Directorate of Health Information published the Official Mexican Standard NOM-024-SSA3-2010. 14 However, the way in which EHRs have been introduced and their specific functionality have varied between institutions and states, mainly because they were developed and implemented before publication of the official standard. 13  15 16 Mexico's health system consists of public institutions and private providers, all of which are under the governance of the Ministry of Health. The public social security institutions provide services to the employees of the formal economic sector and civil servants, as well as other public sector specific institutions (eg, the federal oil company PEMEX and the Armed Forces). Together these account for approximately 44% of the population. 17 The rest of the population is served either by the System for Social Protection in Health (SSPH), also known as Seguro Popular, or by private providers. The SSPH is a health insurance program for the poor and other vulnerable individuals and has become one of the main funding agencies for the health system in Mexico. Its beneficiaries receive healthcare services through the Ministry of Health and the 32 decentralized State Health Services (SHS). Colima's SHS provide health care to approximately 42% of the state's population including the beneficiaries of the SSPH and the Oportunidades Program, a conditional cash transfer program designed to address health and poverty. 18 These two programs are important sources of funds for the operation of the SHS and demand detailed and systematic information about their affiliates, most often by imposing specialized parallel systems.",

The information technology department of the state office of the SSPH was at first in charge of the design and development of the EHR but this responsibility was later transferred to Colima's SHS IT department. The SSPH Affiliation Director, in cooperation with IT specialists from the Colima SHS, physicians, and consultants, continued to lead the development effort. All participants understood that the EHR was being developed to meet the information needs of the SSPH, including the need to provide data to the federal health information system (box 2: quote 2). Although the EHR was not designed to provide information to physicians and other caregivers at the point of care as the key   objective, it does make some relevant information available to them. It was also clear that a key objective was that the EHR should comply with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). At the time SAECCOL was first conceived and developed, the official standard NOM-024-SSA1-2010 for EHRs had not yet been published, but there is now pressure for 100% compliance with it within the next 3 years.",

Training in how to use the system was conducted by the SHS IT department both through facility-specific sessions attended by physicians and facility directors, and through pre-service training of residents of the University of Colima's Medical School (box 3: quote 3). The first phase of implementation took place from 2005 to 2006 with the acquisition of 300 computers, and covered almost 80% of the state's health centers and hospitals.

For example, physicians expressed suspicion that the SHS introduced EHRs in order to monitor medical staff. Respondents at the state level mentioned that federal program administrators sometimes have a paternalistic view of state officials, are dubious about the quality of EHR information, and insist on receiving paper-based reports. A frequently mentioned issue during the interviews and focus group discussions was the ICD-10 classification scheme, which plays a large role in the EHR system. Physicians complained about the difficulty in identifying ICD-10 disease codes, which was not part of their medical education (box 5: quotes 7-9). They mentioned that they are not trained to use ICD-10, and that although most cases are easy to code, a small portion are difficult, resulting in substantial frustration. SHS officials and staff insisted that physicians must make diagnoses using ICD-10, but were trying to develop alternative ways to facilitate physician coding of diagnoses according to ICD-10 to address physician concerns. To help implement diagnosis coding according to ICD-10, at the time of the study, the IT department was building a list of the most common diagnoses (as usually reported by physicians) with their respective ICD-10 codes; however, this effort has still not completely resolved the coding issue. Other challenges mentioned include insufficient training, which causes excessive time to be spent on entering data, frustration with features that ensure the security of records, the rigidity of the system, and resistance to change.",

While young doctors found no difficulty in adapting their workflow in the consultation room to work with the EHR, older doctors complained that it was difficult to use. Doctors in health centers and hospitals where SAECCOL has recently been deployed also complained, but they also indicated interest in receiving more training in order to master its use. The one issue that respondents agreed upon was the difficulties with the use of ICD-10. They all expressed frustration with the need to classify their diagnoses and that it was not part of their training as physicians. They also agreed that Colima's SHS IT department has made important efforts to address those difficulties, but that the issue is still not resolved.",

            "text": "The purpose of the study was to assess the development and implementation of SAECCOL, its perceived benefits and limitations, and to make recommendations to improve the system and implementation process. Our results show that the main driving force behind the design, development, and implementation of SAECCOL was the strengthening of mandated reporting to the SSPH and Oportunidades Program, two of the main programs to improve health and social development in Mexico. The decision to design and develop an EHR to meet the information-reporting requirements of the SSPH and federal health information systems affected the potential of the EHR to influence the quality, efficiency, and cost of health service delivery. The collaborative effort of physicians, hospital administrators, IT specialists, and state officials was fundamental in the design and development process. The University of Colima was instrumental in the decision to follow a 'home grown' EHR development strategy. As a result, and in spite of its reporting focus, physicians saw benefits from improved data availability, a better understanding of their patient's history, and reduced medication errors. However, these benefits fall short of the potential benefits of an EHR for improving quality of care. The SHS of Colima was able to take advantage of the information needs of important health programs to secure funds for initial investment for the development and implementation of their EHR, which proved to be a very successful strategy. The implementation process was phased and systematic, with appropriate attention to infrastructure requirements, and included efforts to involve stakeholders and generate support for adoption among health workers. From our perspective, this is a highly recommended best practice. However, there were several significant challenges to the success of the EHR. First, physicians were concerned that the EHR was designed primarily to evaluate their performance. They also felt strongly that coding ICD-10 diagnoses is a clerical function being forced on them through the EHR and should not be part of their medical practice. 23 Emphasizing the importance of performance monitoring as part of the culture of information and as a way to receive organizational feedback may positively influence the way physicians perceive and react to the EHR's monitoring capacity. Additionally, as ICD-10 coding is needed for standardization of the collection and reporting of EHR data, it must be complied with; nevertheless, the efforts of the IT department to develop alternative features to help the use of this classification scheme may improve the experience of physicians. Another solution to this controversial aspect of SAECCOL would be to allow doctors annotate unclassified diagnoses which would be coded later by specialized coders.",

In addition, the political environment prevented the channeling of financial resources to the project. EHR use started to decline as providers required training and computers needed to be repaired or replaced, and the project faltered. As part of a set of innovative strategies to make the EHR sustainable, the SHS signed an agreement with the University of Colima medical school that all students should be trained in the use of the EHR.",

Also, any change in Colima's SHS administration presents sustainability challenges because newly appointed leaders need to be convinced of the value of the EHR so that they will provide resources for its ongoing maintenance, operation, and development. Fortunately, with the change of administration in 2010, a new perspective on e-government was adopted and the EHR was incorporated into the Governor's State Development Plan, which provided the political basis for directing the necessary resources from both state and federal health programs to strengthen the EHR project. Moreover, the Oportunidades Program, through the SSPH, requested that additional information requirements be met through a parallel information system called Sistema Nominal de Informaci\u00f3n en Salud, but inclusion of the EHR in the State's Development Plan served as leverage to negotiate its use as the sole source of information for federal health programs, thus avoiding the need for parallel systems and allowing a more efficient use of resources.",

In a systematic review of studies on this issue, Boonstra and Broekhuis 25 also found that, overall, EHR adoption rates are low and that there is often resistance from physicians. The authors concluded that the process of EHR implementation should be treated as a managerial change project, rather than simply as a technical strategy.",
