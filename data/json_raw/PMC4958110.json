Fifty consecutive patients received no periarticular injections (group A). Another 50 consecutive patients received a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine (group B). There were no differences in the groups with respect to gender, age, body mass index (BMI), or comorbidities. There was a significant reduction in the amount of narcotics used in the liposomal bupivacaine group (60.97-mg oral morphine equivalent vs 89.74 mg, P \u00bc 0.009). Patients in group B with a BMI <40 and a Charlson comorbidity index of 0-3 had decreased length of stay (2.64 vs 3.06 days, P \u00bc .004), narcotic use over 24-48 hours (110.66 vs 182.47 mg, P \u00bc .013), and narcotic use over 48-72 hours (49.61 vs. 112.65 mg, P \u00bc .004). In patients with a BMI <40 and comorbidity index of 3, periarticular injection using liposomal bupivacaine leads to earlier discharge along with decreased use of narcotics.",

            "text": "The number of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has increased substantially in the last two decades, and currently, TKA is one of the most common orthopaedic procedures performed in the United States [1]. For many patients, pain after TKA can be severe and can compromise postoperative management leading to poor outcomes. Using a multimodal pain management protocol has been shown to improve pain scores, increase patient satisfaction, and enhance early recovery [2]. Currently, there are many postoperative pain management protocols used by orthopaedic surgeons. Regional nerve blocks and local infiltrative analgesia are two techniques that have been shown to provide postoperative pain relief, lower narcotic usage, and improve patient satisfaction in the early postoperative period [3]. Liposomal bupivacaine, Exparel (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Parsippany, NJ), is an extended-release local anesthetic that uses multivesicular liposomes to diffuse bupivacaine over a period of 72 hours after single injection at the operative site [4]. Postoperative pain reduction extended for a period of up to 72 hours would benefit the patient by allowing for a more accelerated rehabilitation protocol, which ultimately will lead to shorter length of hospital stay and improved outcomes. In other surgical procedures, liposomal bupivacaine has been shown to offer multiple clinical advantages over short-acting bupivacaine HCl. After hemorrhoidectomy, it demonstrated a longer duration of action, decreased opioid requirement, and fewer opioid-related adverse effects [5]. Extended-release bupivacaine has also been shown to provide extended pain relief and decreased opioid use after bunionectomy compared to a placebo-controlled group [6].",

Based on our study, the use of a liposomal bupivacaine PAI led to a decrease in narcotic use in the immediate postoperative period in patients undergoing primary TKA. Patients receiving liposomal bupivacaine were able to be discharged from the hospital sooner and had a trend toward increased walking distance earlier in their postoperative course. The greatest benefit was seen for the healthier (CCI, 3) and nonmorbidly obese patients (BMI, <40). No statistically significant difference in length of stay, narcotic use, or walking distance was noted when comparing morbidly obese (BMI, >40) patients and those with multiple comorbidities (CCI, >3).

The study cohort and control groups both consisted of a consecutive series of patients that underwent primary TKA during a similar time period of the year to best eliminate selection bias. There are several questions that arise from the results of this study, which need further exploration. There is an added cost to each case using liposomal bupivacaine as a PAI. In a study by Bagsby et al [12], they concluded that liposomal bupivacaine PAIs provided inferior pain control compared to the less-expensive traditional PAI using shortacting bupivacaine. However, this was also a retrospective study with two different surgeons, and the authors acknowledge that the results may be technique dependent. It is also important to note that this study compared PAI using liposomal bupivacaine versus short-acting bupivacaine, in comparison to our study, which compared liposomal bupivacaine to no PAI in the control group. A prospective, randomized study by Schroer et al [13] that comparing liposomal bupivacaine to standard bupivacaine did not show any significant benefit between the two periarticular injections in patients undergoing primary TKA. Long-acting pain relief with the use of PAIs appears to be an important part of a multimodal pain regimen that allows for earlier discharge and improved outcomes. There is increasing evidence that short-stay and outpatient TKA is feasible in the near future [14]. Longacting pain relief through the use of PAI may allow for this to become a possibility. We demonstrated that healthier patients and those with a BMI <40 had a shorter hospital stay and used fewer narcotics with the use of liposomal bupivacaine. Patients who are morbidly obese and with multiple medical problems may have difficulty in earlier return to function because of their inherent comorbid conditions despite the use of PAIs. In addition, it is not clear whether there are any differences in absorption and release of these PAIs in the morbidly obese patients because of the excess adipose tissue. Additional studies are required to demonstrate the true benefits of liposomal bupivacaine with respect to cost effectiveness compared to a hospital pharmacyeprepared PAI, actual duration of pain relief, and its role in outpatient or short-stay hospitalization after TKA.",
