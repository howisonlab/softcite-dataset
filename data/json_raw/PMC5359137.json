            "text": "Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), characterized by acute cough, account for approximately one-fifth of all consultations in primary care, and the majority of patients who consult are prescribed antibiotics. 1,2 However, adherence to antibiotics in primary care is often poor. 3,4 This wastes health care resources, 5,6 could negatively impact on clinical outcomes, 7 and could result in infecting bacteria being exposed to sub-optimal levels of treatment; creating an environment that promotes antibiotic resistance. 8 With concerns growing about the consequences of increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance, 9 interventions that effectively promote the appropriate use of antibiotics are important. Although most antibiotic stewardship programs have focused on reducing antibiotic use, 10,11 less attention has been paid to ensuring that antibiotics are appropriately used when prescribed. Interventions for improving adherence are likely to be most effective if they are informed by an understanding of the determinants of sub-optimal adherence. These determinants may operate on multiple levels to impact on whether a patient adheres to a prescribed treatment, and therefore large, detailed data sets are required to accurately quantify these influences.",

In brief, Study 1 was a prospective cohort study conducted in 13 European countries between 2006 and 2007; 1 Study 2 was an observational study on the etiology, diagnosis, and prognosis of LRTI conducted in 12 European countries between 2007 and 2010; 15 and Study 3 was a placebo-controlled trial of amoxicillin nested within Study 2. 16 Following an initial consultation with a clinician, participants in all three studies were given a diary that recorded symptoms, medication use, and health care contacts. Participants were asked to complete their diary for 28 days. All three studies collected data using similar case report forms (CRFs) and patient diaries. Study participants were included in analysis if they were prescribed amoxicillin for immediate use at their initial consultation (defined as being prescribed amoxicillin and not advised to delay, as recorded on the CRF) and it was possible to ascertain adherence measures using self-reported diary data. The present study focuses on the use of amoxicillin only, as this is the recommended first-line antibiotic for LRTI in the European Union. 17 In Studies 1 and 2, participants who were prescribed antibiotics other than amoxicillin were excluded. In Study 3 (the trial), amoxicillin was the only antibiotic prescribed.",

The first day of that 1-week gap was defined as the day they discontinued, and the time to discontinuation was calculated as the difference in days between the day of discontinuation and the day of initiation. For example, if a participant was prescribed a 7-day course of amoxicillin, initiated their amoxicillin on day 3, and days 10-17 were the first full week where no amoxicillin was reportedly taken, they would be defined as having discontinued on day 10, and their time from initiation to discontinuation would be 7 days."

This analysis used a large amount of prospective primary care data from patients in diverse settings in Europe, using similar data collection methods and with similar inclusion criteria. The determinants of nonadherence to medication can be multifaceted. 9 Four of the five World Health Organizationdefined dimensions were investigated, and it was possible to assess the clustering of initiation and implementation behavior by clinician, which gave an indication of the influence of clinician attributes on patients' antibiotic treatment adherence. Characteristics of the countries from which patients were recruited were obtained and investigated, rather than estimating the differences between the countries themselves. This provided more useful information, as the goal of this study was to investigate determinants as a platform for intervening in the process, rather than simply to describe variation by country.",
