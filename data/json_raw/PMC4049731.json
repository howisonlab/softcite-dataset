Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative genetic disease, with no available therapeutic options at the moment. We recently reported the characteristics of a HD patient-derived iPSC carrying 72 CAG repeats (HD72-iPSC). In this study, we investigated the in vivo roles of HD72-iPSC in the YAC128 transgenic mice, a commonly used HD mouse model carrying 128 CAG repeats. To do this, we transplanted HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors into the striatum of YAC128 mice bilaterally and observed a significant behavioral improvement in the grafted mice. Interestingly, the transplanted HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors formed GABAeric neurons efficiently, but no EM48-positive protein aggregates were detected at 12 weeks after transplantation. Taken together, these results indicate no HD pathology was developed from the grafted cells, or no transmission of HD pathology from the host to the graft occurred at 12 weeks post-transplantation.",

Using iPSC technology, it is possible to create both genetically inherited and sporadic diseases in vitro (3). Moreover, since iPSCs can be derived directly from patients with a given disease, they carry all of the genetic components associated with the disease, which make certain cell types more susceptible to a disease state, thereby serving as the most useful genetic model of the disease (4).",

In sham control mice (n=15) we only injected suspension medium (GMEM) into both hemi-spheres in parallel. Uninjected YAC128 wild-type littermates were included as a control group (n=14). To evaluate functional effects of the grafts, we employed rotarod test, because it has been shown that rotarod performance is greatly reduced in the YAC128 mice. They exhibit rotarod deficit initially at 4 months of age but become more prominent at 6 months of age (12). Poor performance on the rotarod represents motor learning deficits, indicating some aspects of cognitive functions are also affected in YAC128 mice. To our surprise, we observed a significant improvement of rotarod activity in the transplanted group at as early as three weeks after transplantation, compared with the sham controls (Fig. 2). Therefore, these results strongly suggest that HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors played some beneficial roles after transplantation, although they carry genetic mutations.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the in vivo roles of HD72-iPSC in the YAC128 transgenic mice, a commonly used preclinical mouse model of HD, carrying the entire 170-kb genomic locus of human HTT gene (12). To do this, we transplanted HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors into the striatum of YAC128 mice bilaterally and observed a significant improvement in the rotarod performance. Interestingly, although they carry genetic mutations, the transplanted HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors formed GABAeric and MSN-type neurons efficiently, and led to no obvious neuropathological development, judged by the absence of but EM48-positive protein aggregates at 12 weeks after transplantation. This ob-servation was very similar to our recent report (10), in which the same type of cells were transplanted into the quinolinic acid-lesioned rodent model of HD. However, in the same report, we also showed that HD pathology can develop after \u223c9 months in vivo (10), suggesting that cellular age may be a key factor in identifying aggregates in human HD-iPSCs (4). Therefore, it will be likely that the transplanted HD72-iPSC-derived neural precursors will give rise to EM48-positive aggregates at later stages. Another important aspect of results is that no EM48-positive aggregates were detected in the transplanted cells at 12 weeks post-transplantation, while the host tissue in the YAC128 mice normally expresses EM48. Moreover, DARPP-32-positive medium spiny neurons were already affected by EM48-positive aggregates. These results strongly indicate that no HD pathology was developed either from the transplanted cells, or no transmission of HD pathology from the host to the graft took place at 12 weeks post-transplantation. It will be interesting to investigate whether \"host-to-graft\" or \"graft-to-host\" transmission of HD pathology can occur at later stages. At the same time, it will be important to address whether and how normal iPSC-derived GABAergic neurons can contribute to the functional recovery and neuronal regeneration. In order these HD-iPSCs to be used for the cell therapy, it will essential to target the HTT mutation and correct it to a normal gene in the HD-iPSCS before transplantation (15). There are a wide range of HD-iPSC lines available through HD iPSC consortium (16), so it will be useful to uncover their pathogenic mechanisms in the future. Taken together, results from this study can provide useful insights on the in vivo function and pathogenic effects of human HD-iPSCs, as well as on the development of HD therapeutics in the future.",
