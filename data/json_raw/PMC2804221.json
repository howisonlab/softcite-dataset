            "text": "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is an incretin released from intestinal L-cells in response to food intake. Activation of the GLP-1 receptor potentiates the synthesis and release of insulin from pancreatic \u2424-cells in a glucose-dependent manner. The GLP-1 receptor belongs to class B of the G-protein-coupled receptors, a subfamily characterized by a large N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain. Exendin-4 and GLP-1 are 50% identical, and exendin-4 is a full agonist with similar affinity and potency for the GLP-1 receptor. We recently solved the crystal structure of the GLP-1 receptor extracellular domain in complex with the competitive antagonist exendin-4(9-39). Interestingly, the isolated extracellular domain binds exendin-4 with much higher affinity than the endogenous agonist GLP-1. Here, we have solved the crystal structure of the extracellular domain in complex with GLP-1 to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. The structure shows that important hydrophobic ligand-receptor interactions are conserved in agonist-and antagonist-bound forms of the extracellular domain, but certain residues in the ligand-binding site adopt a GLP-1-specific conformation. GLP-1 is a kinked but continuous \u2423-helix from Thr 13 to Val 33 when bound to the extracellular domain. We supplemented the crystal structure with site-directed mutagenesis to link the structural information of the isolated extracellular domain with the binding properties of the full-length receptor. The data support the existence of differences in the binding modes of GLP-1 and exendin-4 on the full-length GLP-1 receptor.",

            "text": "GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a peptide hormone produced by post-translational processing of proglucagon in the intestinal L-cells (1). GLP-1 is an incretin that potentiates the synthesis and release of insulin from pancreatic \u2424-cells in a glucose-dependent manner (2) and has a number of other beneficial effects that contribute to reducing blood sugar (3)(4)(5)(6). In addition, GLP-1 has been shown to reduce body weight (3,5,7), which is favorable for many people with type 2 diabetes. Hence, GLP-1-based therapies are becoming increasingly attractive for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The actions of GLP-1 are mediated through the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), 3 which is a seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) coupled to adenylyl cyclase (8). The human GLP-1R was first cloned in 1992 and belongs to class B of GPCRs (9). This class includes a wide range of receptors for peptide hormones like glucagon, GLP-2 (glucagon-like peptide-2), glucosedependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, secretin, calcitonin, corticotrophinreleasing factor, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) (10). The receptors are distinguished by their large extracellular N-terminal domain (ECD), which is important for ligand binding and selectivity (11,12). The current binding model suggests a two-domain mechanism where the C-terminal part of the ligand binds the ECD and the N-terminal part of the ligand binds the extracellular loops and transmembrane \u2423-helices (TM domain), which leads to receptor activation (reviewed in Ref. 13).",

The ECDs of class B receptors have a common structure, the secretin recognition fold, which is stabilized by three conserved disulfide bonds and five conserved residues (Asp 67 , Trp 72 , Pro 86 , Gly 108 , and Trp 110 in GLP-1R). The receptor-bound ligands are primarily in \u2423-helical con-formation, and the C-terminal part of the ligands binds the ECD in agreement with the two-domain binding mechanism. Several receptor models have been proposed for full-length class B receptors (20 -23). However, the orientation of the ECD relative to the TM domain is uncertain.",

N-terminally truncated exendin-4 variants maintain high affinity but are unable to activate GLP-1R, i.e. competitive antagonist, whereas N-terminal truncation of GLP-1 severely affects both binding and activation (31). Clearly, the interaction between the N-terminal part of GLP-1 and the TM domain is critical for binding and activation of GLP-1R.",

We recently solved the crystal structure of the GLP-1R ECD in complex with exendin-4(9 -39) (18). Exendin-4(9 -39) is \u2423-helical in the ECD-bound conformation except for the C-terminal segment, the so-called Trp cage (33,34). In solution, the helical propensity of exendin-4 is higher than that of GLP-1 (27,33). Biophysical studies showed a positive correlation between \u2423-helical propensity in solution and affinity for the GLP-1R ECD (27). Moreover, charged residues of exendin-4 interact with the ECD in a manner not possible for GLP-1 (18). Hence, the high affinity of exendin-4 for the ECD may be a combination of high helical propensity in solution and unique receptor interactions.",

The phases and electron density map were obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser running in the CCP4 program interface with one complex in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was done using COOT (36) and REFMAC5 (37). Well defined electron density was obtained for GLP-1 residues Thr 11 *-Val 33 * and for ECD residues Val 30 -Glu 128 . Poor density was observed for GLP-1 residues Gly 10 *, Lys 34 *, and Gly 35 * and ECD residues Thr 29 and Asn 115 . No electron density was observed for His 7 *-Glu 9 * and Arg 36 *-Gly 37 * of GLP-1.

A complex of GLP-1 and the ECD was purified by size exclusion chromatography (supplemental Fig. S1). The purified complex was characterized by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig.  S1), concentrated, and crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal using the beamline 1911-3 at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden), and the structure of GLP-1 in complex with the GLP-1R ECD was solved to 2.1 \u00c5 resolution by molecular replacement (Fig.  1A). We removed exendin-4(9 -39) from the structure of the exendin-4(9 -39)-ECD complex (Protein Data Bank code 3C59) and used the apo-form of GLP-1R ECD as the search model for the molecular replacement. GLP-1 was then built into the model; its position was unambiguous due to good electron density for most of the ligand. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Throughout the text, GLP-1 and exendin-4 residues are designated with * and **, respectively. Exendin-4 is numbered 1-39 and GLP-1 is numbered 7-37, due to post-translational processing. The aligned sequences are illustrated in Fig. 1B. Structure of the GLP-1R Extracellular Domain-The crystal structure of the ECD in the GLP-1-bound form shown here is very similar to the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound form shown previously (root mean square deviation of 0.79 \u00c5 for C \u2423 atoms of the ECD) (18). The ligand-binding sites are identical, which is not surprising given the competitive binding of GLP-1 and exendin-4 for the full-length GLP-1R as well as the isolated ECD (27). However, we have previously shown that divergent residues in the two ligands are responsible for their different physical properties in solution and their different affinity for the ECD (27). As described below, these divergent residues give rise to structural differences in the two ligand-bound forms of the ECD at the level of specific side chain conformations.",

The amphiphilic nature of this \u2423-helical segment enables hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions through opposite faces of the \u2423-helix. The hydrophilic face is comprised by residues Gln 23 *, Lys 26 *, Glu 27 *, and Lys 34 *. Lys 26 * is the only one of these that may interact directly with the ECD (Fig. 2A). The side chain of Lys 26 * may form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Glu 128 (\u03f33.0 \u00c5), but the B-factor is rather high for both residues (\u03f325 compared with 10 for well defined residues), suggesting that this is not a strong interaction. In particular, the electron density of the Lys 26 * side chain is rather weak. In exendin-4(9 -39), the amphiphilic character is more pronounced, and the \u2423-helical conformation is further stabilized by intramolecular interactions between Glu 16 **, Glu 17 **, Arg 20 **, Glu 24 **, and Lys 27 ** on the hydrophilic face (18). In addition, Arg 20 ** and Lys 27 ** interact with Glu 128 and Glu 127 of the ECD, respectively (18). The corresponding intramolecular stabilization is not possible in GLP-1 due to a less favorable alignment of oppositely charged residues (Fig. 1B), and Glu 127 of the ECD is not involved in binding of GLP-1 ( Fig. 2A).",

The importance of Phe 28 *, Ile 29 *, and Leu 32 * in GLP-1 binding has been demonstrated previously by Ala scanning of GLP-1 (38). Substitution of Phe 28 * with Ala had the most severe effect on GLP-1 affinity in the Ala scan (IC 50 value increased by 1300-fold), and indeed Phe 28 * is centrally positioned in the ligand-receptor interface emphasizing the importance of this hydrophobic ligand-receptor interaction. The I29*A and L32*A substitutions also reduced GLP-1 affinity significantly (IC 50 value increased by 93-and 17-fold, respectively) (38). Trp 31 * is also on the hydrophobic face of GLP-1 but is rather solvent-exposed and does not interact with the ECD (Fig. 2B). Trp 31 * is conserved in the glucagon peptide family (GLP-1, exendin-4, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-2, see Fig. 1B), which implies a unique role of this residue. However, substitution of Trp 31 * with Ala only reduced the binding affinity of GLP-1 slightly at the full-length GLP-1R (38), so the role of Trp 31 * in receptor binding is unclear.",

The crystal structure presented here suggests that one diverging residue in the two ligands (Val 33 * of GLP-1 and Lys 27 ** of exendin-4(9 -39)) causes a shift in the conformations of four residues in (or close to) the binding pocket of the ECD, namely Glu 127 , Leu 123 , Arg 121 , and Pro 119 (Fig. 3A). In exendin-4(9 -39), Lys 27 ** interacts with Glu 127 , and the positioning of the Lys 27 ** side chain appears to be guided by a hydrophobic interaction with Leu 123 . In GLP-1, Val 33 * is unable to interact with Glu 127 causing Glu 127 to change rotamer conformation and point its side chain away from GLP-1. The side chain of Leu 123 is flipped toward Arg 121 , which again is flipped toward Pro 119 , thereby closing an otherwise water-accessible cavity observed in the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure (Fig. 3A). The closing of this cavity is assisted by a side chain flip of Pro 119 toward Arg 121 . The apparent GLP-1-specific conformations affect the conserved core of the ECD by rotating the guanidine group of Arg 102 and by decreasing the distance between Asp 67 and Arg 102 compared with the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure without affecting the relative position and conformation of Trp 72 and Trp 110 (Fig.  3B). This enables a direct interaction through a hydrogen bond between Asp 67 and Arg 102 unlike what we observed in the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure, where a water molecule mediated the interaction between Asp 67 and Arg 102 (Fig. 3B).

The mutants were characterized by their ability to bind GLP-1 and exendin-4, using the agonist 125 I-GLP-1 tracer, and by their ability to stimulate cAMP production in response to GLP-1 and exendin-4 ( Table 2). The main objective was to search for mutations with differential effect on GLP-1 and exendin-4. We initially focused on Glu 127 , which showed an obvious conformational difference in the two ligand-bound structures (Fig. 3A), Glu 127 interacts directly with exendin-4(9 -39) but not with GLP-1 (18). The ECD structures suggest that the hydrogen-bonding potential of Glu 127 is important for exendin-4 binding but not for binding of GLP-1, and this is supported by the site-directed mutagenesis data ( Table 2). Mutation of Glu 127 to Ala reduced the affinity for exendin-4 but not for GLP-1 (6.8versus 1.7-fold, respectively). Glu 128 interacts with a positively charged residue in both GLP-1 and exendin-4, which may explain why the E128A substitution did not have a differential effect on the binding affinity of GLP-1 and exendin-4. The differential effect of the E127A mutation on GLP-1 and exendin-4 binding is rather small compared with the differential affinity of the isolated ECD shown previously (27). Clearly, the superior helical propensity of exendin-4 contributes strongly to its high affinity for the ECD.",

Neither the potency nor the affinity of GLP-1 was affected by the L32A mutation (Fig. 4), and the expression level of the receptor was similar to wild-type GLP-1R, which confirmed the structural integrity of this receptor mutant. Leu 32 is the first residue in the \u2423-helix of the GLP-1R ECD, and it defines the border of the hydrophobic binding cavity by interacting with Ala 24 *, Ala 25 *, and Phe 28 * (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that Leu 32 is important for the binding of exendin-4 but not for the binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R. It is difficult to give a structural explanation of the ligand-specific effect of the L32A mutation by comparing the two ligand-bound forms of the ECD, because the structural differences in this region are quite subtle. Nevertheless, the ligand-specific effect of the L32A mutation supports the existence of differences in the binding modes of GLP-1 and exendin-4 to the full-length GLP-1R. Clearly, the two-domain binding mechanism of the full-length GLP-1R is more complex than binding of the isolated ECD.",

Structure-activity studies of GLP-1 showed that side chain to side chain cyclization by lactam bridge formation of residues 16 -20 and 18 -22 were well tolerated. Cyclization of residues 11-15 improved potency for GLP-1R compared with the linear coun-  terpart (40,41). These data support the existence of an \u2423-helical conformation in the N-terminal part of GLP-1 when bound to the full-length GLP-1R. It is interesting that in the ECD-bound structure, the Thr 13 *-Glu 21 * segment of GLP-1 adopts an \u2423-helical conformation even though this segment does not interact with the ECD. The C-terminal segment of GLP-1 (Ala 24 *-Val 33 *) is stabilized in a specific \u2423-helical conformation through binding to the ECD. This may subsequently stabilize an \u2423-helical conformation in the N-terminal part of the ligand (Thr 13 *-Glu 21 *). This hypothesis is supported by the solution structure of GLP-1 in different concentrations of trifluoroethanol (39). GLP-1 is a random coil in pure water, but adding trifluoroethanol enables the C-terminal segment of GLP-1 to adopt an \u2423-helix conformation. The C-terminal \u2423-helix is gradually extended toward the N-terminus of the peptide with increasing concentrations of trifluoroethanol (39), and it seems possible that a similar mechanism is initiated upon binding of GLP-1 to the ECD. It was recently proposed that \u2423-helix for-mation of the ligand upon binding to the ECD is an important step in the activation of class B GPCRs (23).",

The distortion is also observed in the NMR structures of GLP-1 in solution (39). However, we cannot exclude that the kink observed in the crystal structure is a result of crystal packing between the N-terminal part of GLP-1 (Gly 10 *-Glu 21 *) and symmetry-related ECDs rather than a functionally important characteristic of GLP-1 (Fig. 5, B-D). Substitution of Gly 22 * with Ala was previously shown not to affect the functionality or the binding affinity of GLP-1, which suggests that flexibility around Gly 22 * is not required for binding to or activation of GLP-1R (38). Interestingly, Leu 32 of the ECD is positioned right next to the kink of GLP-1 (Fig.  5A). Thus, we have demonstrated a ligand-specific effect of the L32A mutation and have shown that ECD-bound GLP-1 has a kink right next to Leu 32 , whereas ECD-bound exendin-4(9 -39) is straight. This may be a coincidence, but it is tempting to speculate that there is a connection between the structural difference of the ligands (kinked or straight helix) and the differential effect of the L32A mutant on binding of the ligands.",

Residues 1-7 of PACAP(1-21) adopt a specific \u2424-coil structure upon receptor binding followed by an \u2423-helical structure of residues 8 -21 (44). The relevance of the receptor-bound PACAP(1-21) structure for GLP-1 in particular is supported by a previous study of chimeric PACAP/GLP-1 peptides (45). Substituting five residues from the N-terminus of GLP-1 with those of PACAP (three nonconserved, Fig. 1B) had no effect on either the affinity or potency for GLP-1R.

Ribbon diagrams showing significant differences in side chain conformations between the GLP-1-bound structure and the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure of GLP-1R ECD. Receptor and ligand residues are highlighted in blue for the GLP-1-bound structure and in orange for the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure. Water molecules in orange are present only in the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure. A, one diverging residue, Val 33 * of GLP-1 and Lys 27 ** of exendin-4(9 -39), causes a shift in the conformations of four residues, namely Glu 127 , Leu 123 , Arg 121 , and Pro 119 . B, GLP-1-specific conformations affect the conserved core of the ECD by rotating the guanidine group of Arg 102 and by decreasing the distance between Asp 67 and Arg 102 compared with the exendin-4(9 -39)-bound structure without affecting the relative position of Trp 72 and Trp 110 .",
