Increasing lifespans and ageing populations also contribute to an increasing CV burden. However, in China, there were few well-designed cohort studies focusing on the elderly population, let alone an established CV risk score. The objective of this study is to establish a CV risk score based on a communitydwelling Chinese elderly population, determining the profile of the associated CV risk factors and target organ damages (TODs), so as to guide the later intervention.",

However, collected data and the later risk score can also be used for validation in younger cohorts. \u25aa Some measurements in this study need highly specialised equipment, which is hard to scale to a larger population.",

This great challenge is due in part to the absence of a domestic CV risk score in China. Given the perniciousness of CVDs, an established CV risk score is essential to guide prevention and therapy in China. 9 10 In fact, in the USA and Europe, many wellknown population studies with great professional achievements were conducted, and some mature CV risk score systems have already been established and applied efficiently, such as the Framingham Risk Score and the European SCORE Risk Charts. 11 12 These studies pushed the transition from a poor understanding of CVDs to a more mature one going forward. 13 The current risk scores in the USA and Europe are based on a mainly Caucasian general population. However, in China, things would be different. According to the World Population Ageing 2013, it will take China only 26 years to experience the population ageing, which means there is a rapid ageing trend in China. On the other hand, China also had the most rapid urbanisation in history. These two trends will interact in important ways with each other and will have a profound effect on Chinese CV health. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to apply those risk scores directly in the Chinese elderly. In Shanghai, the biggest urbanised city in China, the proportion aged over 60 years is 28.8% (Elderly population and cause of aging monitoring statistics of Shanghai in 2014 Accession Number: http://www.shmzj.gov.cn/ Attach/Attaches/201506/20150610104009609.doc). In this respect, Shanghai could be a good representative of the future Chinese population, with the deep urbanisation and the geriatric population. We therefore selected community-based citizens in Shanghai as our target population. The characteristics and successful experience on the CV risk control in this Shanghai geriatric population, acting as an exemplary role, could be extrapolated to the future Chinese society. It means that effective interventions for the future Chinese would be designed 10-20 years sooner.",

The independent variables are defined and categorised as follows: LV hypertrophy: LV mass index >115 g/m 2 for men and >95 g/m 2 for women; arterial stiffening: cf-PWV>12 m/s; carotid hypertrophy: IMT \u22650.9 mm; lower limb atherosclerosis: ABI \u22640.9; microalbuminuria: UACR >30 mg/mmol; renal function decline: stage 2 CKD: eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (MDRD); stage 3 or more CKD: eGFR <60 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 (MDRD); age is categorised into two groups: 65-80 years and over 80 years; obesity: BMI\u226528.0 kg/m 2 .

[11][12][13] In fact, most of them were conducted in the general population focusing on conventional risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose level, etc. However, for the elderly, the long-term exposure and accumulated microdamages from conventional risk factors have been converted into TODs. In this respect, just considering the conventional risk factors in the risk assessment strategy for the elderly may be inadequate. 40 Taking a '70 years old chain smoker' with severe atherosclerosis, for example, we prefer to reverse, terminate or at least control the process of atherosclerosis (TOD), instead of just advising him to quit his long-term formed smoking. For this patient, the CV risk from longterm exposure to smoking has turned into severe atherosclerosis. The intervention of smoking cessation would be less beneficial compared with the lipid-lowering therapy. For the Chinese elderly, some TODs are more likely to be reversible than the inveterate risk factors like smoking. Actually, many asymptomatic TODs have been proved to be modifiable by medications, even in the late stage. For example, angiotensin receptor blockade (losartan) has been validated for reversing cardiac hypertrophy. 41 Therefore, we suggest the transition of the CV risk assessment from conventional risk factors (like age, gender and smoking) to the combination of asymptomatic TODs and risk factors in the elderly, which might be more compatible with the ageing population.",
