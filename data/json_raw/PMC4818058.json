            "text": "The present study aimed to identify the psychological profiles of professional futsal players in terms of the gender schema and to evaluate the physiological parameters (speed, acceleration, strength, and power) and fatigue index of these athletes according to their gender profiles and relative to their positions on the court. The Masculine Inventory of the Self-concept Gender Schemas was used to classify the sample into typological groups, and the Running Anaerobic Sprint Test was used to measure the physiological parameters (speed, acceleration, strength, and power) and the fatigue index. The study sample was composed of 64 male professional futsal players who competed in the National Indoor Soccer league in 2013; the subjects had an average weight of 76.00\u00b16.7 kg. Among the athletes studied, 23 (35.9%) were classified as heteroschematic female, 22 (34.4%) as heteroschematic male, and 19 (29.7%) as isoschematic. Regarding their positions on the court, eleven were goalkeepers (17.2%), 13 (20.3%) were defenders, 28 (43.8%) were midfielders, and 12 (18.8%) were attackers. The players had similar weights even when belonging to different typological groups and having different positions in the court. However, it is worth noting that male heteroschematic players had a greater mean weight (77.11\u00b15.93 kg) and that the goalkeeper was, on average, the heaviest player (79.36\u00b18.14 kg). The results of the physiological parameter analysis relative to typological group showed that, on average, high-level soccer players presented similar performance profiles in different rounds, as statistically significant differences were not found in any of the studied physiological variables (weight, distance, speed, acceleration, strength, power, and fatigue index). Although the results of this research did not reveal statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of the assessed variables, we observed that some results related to personality traits associated with both the male and female components could help to clarify and establish relationships with some strategic aspects inherent to futsal.",

            "text": "According to Gomes et al, 1 high-performance sport has evolved significantly worldwide in recent decades. Because of this evolutionary process, the study of sports training has adopted a practical approach to athletic preparation, using widespread scientific knowledge as guidance for intervention in the technical commissioning of the team. For example, some of the many challenges faced by the practitioners of sports science in training include assessment of futsal athletes' fatigue levels and identification of which conditions are better for training and competition. [12][13][14] Futsal is among the most practiced sports in Brazil, but questions regarding the best type of training and best performance of players have not yet been addressed satisfactorily. A systematic analysis of literature related to this discipline revealed that studies attempting to identify factors related to fatigue (eg, psychological aspects) are scarce. Although psychological aspects are an important variable in the performance of elite athletes, coaches and coaching staff still base their training on empiricism, without consolidating their working methodologies with scientific evidence. 1 In this sense, it becomes important to understand the cognitive and emotional schemas of the high-performance athlete in order to draw inferences about future behavior in competition situations. 5 This concern regarding athletes' cognitive styles is not new to the field of sports psychology, and some researchers have sought and still seek the ideal athletic psychological traits, or personality structures that are better adjusted to events occurring in a sporting context. [15][16][17][18] For example, Markus et al defined self-concept as a multidimensional structure composed of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components, resulting in patterns of selfperception and perception of others. 19 Therefore, a person's self-concept is not inherent to the self-being but is rather a construction developed throughout life, resulting from that person's interpersonal relationships, family, school, and social environment, and self-perceptions of success and failure derived from personal experience. Athletes are the results of all of these influences, and their performances are directly affected by the individual personalities they have constructed throughout their lives. The self-schema is an important aspect of self-concept; this is considered an important feature and is used by individuals in their self-descriptions. 20 Self-schemas act as lenses that shape, filter, focus, and guide perception, and thus, influence the way in which information is processed. Among the existing self-schemas, those related to gender are formed from observations and experiences of the characteristics, roles, and norms pertaining to the constructs of masculinity and femininity. As each individual has experiences consistent with gender constructs during social interaction, they eventually incorporate these experiences in different proportions and measures, resulting in specific cognitive schemas called gender schemas. In Brazilian culture, for example, characteristics such as sensitivity, gentleness, emotionalism, sensuality, fragility, and passivity are considered relevant to femininity, whereas rationality, aggressiveness, competitiveness, objectivity, individualism, and stubbornness are considered relevant to masculinity. 21 During a game, elite athletes encounter situations wherein these psychological constructs can directly influence how they face the challenges of competition, and hence, their performance. It thus becomes critical for coaches not only to identify this intervening variable, but also, if possible, to achieve control over it.",

In addition, suitable profiles may vary depending on the player's position on the court/field (team sports), type of competition (in the case of individual sports), and specific action taking place. Therefore, it can be stated that there is no single ideal psychological profile, but rather several profiles that require specification. Despite the importance of investigating possible causes that lead an individual to experience fatigue during exercise, an investigation of the psychological aspects that influence this fatigue has also become an area of interest for all sports professionals working in the field of high-performance sports. The reviewed literature suggests differences between the fatigue levels of men and women; however, as the purpose of this study was to evaluate differences between the genders, no comparative studies of these differences were found. Overall, health-related studies treat gender as sex, when in fact gender and sex have two different definitions. Sex refers exclusively to the biological and physiological characteristics related to men or women. Gender refers to the addition of the psychological aspects of masculinity and femininity (eg, behaviors, attitudes, social roles) to the characteristics of sex. 22 All of these studies originated from a study by Giavoni, 23 who constructed mathematical models capable of assessing the gender profiles of men (Masculine Inventory of the Self-concept Gender Schemas [IMEGA]) and feminine (IFEGA) and classifying these profiles as heteroschematic masculine, heteroschematic feminine, or isoschematic. This classification identifies the psychological gender profile of an individual independently of sex.",

The hypothesis of the current research is that the results in the Running Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST), which assesses the fatigue index, would be higher in a male heteroschematic gender profile than in the isoschematic and female heteroschematic profiles, because futsal is taken mainly as a sport with similar traits to those that constitute the male schemas in the Brazilian culture, and therefore, the male heteroschematic athlete would engage more in the practice of this sport, either in trainings or competitions, as well as in RAST.",

The subject uses a variation ranging from zero to four to express how much he identifies with each item. The male scale is based on neglect, rationality, boldness, and aggressiveness factors, while the female scale is based on integrity, sensuality, insecurity, emotionality, and sensitivity factors. 24 From the interaction between more or less prevalent characteristics, a three-dimensional vector is formed, which represents the spatial form of the male or female scheme (male heteroschematic and female heteroschematic, respectively). There is also the possibility that the interaction between contemplated characteristics by IMEGA identify a hybrid scheme called isoschematic. 24 The athletes were instructed not to communicate with each other during the application of IMEGA and not to comment on this assessment before completing the other data collection procedures.",

Athletes classified as heteroschematic males started and ended with greater strength values. However, there were no statistically significant (P.0.05) differences in terms of strength among the groups. Athletes need more power and less fatigue to maintain peak performance. The fatigue indices of the three groups were similar. The data proved the lack of significant differences between the groups relative to the fatigue index (P=0.48). When analyzing the data descriptively, because the P-values obtained in the test prevented any type of statistical inference for the entire target population, it was observed that heteroschematic female players had a higher fatigue index, thus contradicting the findings of a similar study conducted by Gomes et al. 1 The results of the physiological parameter analysis relative to typological group showed that, on average, high-level soccer players presented similar performance profiles in different rounds, as statistically significant differences were not found in any of the studied physiological variables (weight, distance, speed, acceleration, strength, power, and fatigue index).",

In the sports domain, personality is considered a poor predictor of performance but is a predictor of the long-term conversion of skills into achievements. 31 Self-centeredness Notes: Dimension 1 explains 56.0% of the inertia of the cloud, while dimension 2 explains 44%. These two dimensions are sufficient to retain the maximum possible variability (inertia). This Perceptual map displays major contributions of the model in opposition to the origin and is based on individual quadrants. In the first quadrant we observe a possible association between the pivot and wing position while the typological group is heteroschematic. In the third quadrant we can see the goalkeeper with an isoschematic configuration and in the fourth quadrant the athlete standing with the female is heteroschematic in configuration. The chi-square test at a confidence level of 95% was used to determine whether associations existed between court positions and typological groups. The test found no predominance of any typological group in terms of specific player positions (P=0.60). Nevertheless , we can see that there is a higher correlation with the heteroschematic male attackers -the closer the typological group is on the court position, the greater the correlation between them.",

[33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] The BFF addresses five dimensions: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness. 42 The research conducted by Weinberg and Gould indicated that the main investigations into the personalities of athletes have been oriented to the identification of a number of defining traits. 34 A personality trait is a characteristic tendency of an individual to act and behave in a certain manner. These investigations, 34 which are mainly based on personality questionnaires, focus on the determination of personality traits corresponding to sports participation and the achievement of better results in competitions. The possibility of identifying those traits and to what degree they are present in athletes might allow us to anticipate the athlete's behavior, or at least their psychological reactions.",

This was because in addition to the predominantly male nature of soccer and futsal in Brazil, which is a game composed of strong features that define masculinity (aggressiveness, strength, endurance, pain tolerance, resistance to fatigue, among others), these subjects would exhibit a tendency toward individualism and would value traits such as overcoming limitations, self-determination, self-realization, power, competitiveness, and hedonism. Conversely, heteroschematic female subjects were expected to exhibit lower engagement in the activities that permeate this sport, because they would perceive the masculine traits of the discipline as incongruent with the structure of their predominant schema. Furthermore, given the collectivist nature of the female schema, these individuals would not exhibit a desire to overcome their own limits, embrace competitiveness, or other traits valued by individualists. These subjects would rather consider that the advancement of their goals and personal development would be directly related to appreciation and prestige of the group. The isoschematic type was expected to exhibit an intermediate performance relative to the other groups, as this group comprises a mix of the male and female schemas. The presence of a developed male schema would not cause these individuals to consider futsal as a discipline in which traits were inconsistent with their personality structure. Accordingly, because of this perception, the behavior of these individuals would tend to be similar to that displayed by heteroschematic males in terms of valuing individualistic traits such as self-determination, selfrealization, power, and hedonism. However, the presence of the female schema softens this individualistic trend and inserts the collectivist perspective of seeking self-improvement and self-realization while simultaneously seeking the cohesion, success, and well-being of the team.",

This study is considered unique because it studied the influences of the psychological profiles of gender schemas of self-concept on the physical fitness of elite futsal players through an assessment of their performances regarding the main physical skills used in the sport. Based on these results, a suggestion of this study is the use of gender schema typology for guiding the athletes participating in this sport, with the aim of better performance in specific court functions or even to solve certain problem situations within the game, as athletes belonging to different typological groups will likely exhibit different responses when subjected to the same game situation.",
