Any difference between actual and expected clinical environment will decrease nursing students' interest in clinical environments and has a negative correlation with their clinical performance. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study is an attempt to compare nursing students' perception of the actual and expected status of clinical environments in medical-surgical wards. Participants of the study were 127 bachelor nursing students of Iran University of Medical Sciences in the internship period. Data gathering instruments were a demographic questionnaire (including sex, age, and grade point average), and the Clinical Learning Environment Inventory (CLEI) originally developed by Professor Chan (2001), in which its modified Farsi version (Actual and Preferred forms) consisting 42 items, 6 scales and 7 items per scale was used. Descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test, paired t-test, ANOVA) were used for data analysis through SPSS version 16. Results: The results indicated that there were significant differences between the preferred and actual form in all six scales. In other word, comparing with the actual form, the mean scores of all items in the preferred form were higher. The maximum mean difference was in innovation and the highest mean difference was in involvement scale. Conclusion: It is concluded that nursing students do not have a positive perception of their actual clinical teaching environment and this perception is significantly different from their perception of their expected environment.",

            "text": "In this regard, several studies have shown that the learning environment is a significant component with respect to clinical learning and learning outcomes (3). Throughout nursing history, clinical placements play an essential role in the learning process of nursing students (4). Additionally, nursing students may think that clinical environment is the most influential educational component to acquire nursing knowledge and skills (5). The clinical environment consists of inpatient, hospital outpatient and community settings, which has its specific challenges. Pringle and Green believed that nursing clinical experience is a factor that affects nursing student attribution (6). According to Farnia et al (2005), nursing students look for a favorable learning environment and their perception of the clinical learning environment is different from their perception of the actual learning environment (7). Zuzelo (2001) claimed that the most important step to develop continuing nursing education is to study nursing students' perception and to find the impacts of educational program on bachelor degrees (8). In this regard, Pugnair, et al. (2004) also supposed that assessing students' perception and satisfaction of clinical nursing experience would be essential for nursing faculty, because it gives feedback to students, faculty and school and leads to enhanced educational performance (9). To increase the quality of nursing education programs along with evaluating nursing schools, students' comments should be considered important. Nursing students' perceptions about clinical education has been assessed in different countries (10-14), however, Iranian studies in this field are rare (15).",

In addition, those students who suffered from chronic or disabling diseases and psychosomatic disorders were excluded from the study. Moreover, participants of the study were informed about the purpose of the study. Then, consent form was secured from each of them.

Innovation measures the extent to which clinical teacher or clinician plans for interesting productive learning experiences. Involvement assesses the extent to which students participate actively and attentively in hospital activities. Personalization emphasizes on opportunities for each individual student to interact with the clinical teacher. Task Orientation, however, assesses whether the instructions for hospital activities are clear and well organized. Student Satisfaction in actual form was used to assess the students' level of satisfaction due to their clinical placements (10, 13).

In this regard, the level of difference between the actual and expected states is \"involvement in clinical activities\". Consistent with Chan's findings, the lowest difference may be associated with the minimum tendency of students to do clinical activities (10). Students name the following situations as stress inducing: care of a terminally ill patient, time pressure of certain activities, clinical trial evaluations, performance and frequent changes of services/health institutes (37)(38)(39), which may be due to students' low expectations to become involved in clinical activities. On the other hand, according to Chan, students believe that after being involved in clinical activities they experience less anxiety and stress in clinical environments (10). This shows that if instructors facilitate involvement of students in clinical activities, there may be a room for students' expectations. Clinical staff must provide clear instructions to render safe care by students that shows the relationship between the two domains, including \"students' involvement in clinical activities\" and \"task orientation in clinical period\" in order to facilitate student involvement in ward activities.
