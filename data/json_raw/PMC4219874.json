Seeds of Nigella sativa have been used for a long time in folk medicine for the treatment of skin infections. Production of new potent agents is urgently needed, especially for hospitals and health care centers. This study is designed to explore anti-microbial effect of extract from the Nigella sativa seeds against skin pustules infection. Methods: The in vivo anti-microbial effect of the Nigella sativa seeds extract at a concentration of 33% on pustules staphylococcal Skin Infections was assessed and compared with standard drug mupirocin on 40 neonates .All neonates were divided and examined into two experimental and control groups randomly. Recovery times were compared between two groups. Results: The mean of recovery time in experimental group was 75/1 with SD= \u00b1 12, and the mean of recovery time in control group was 69/4 with SD = \u00b1 8/7.There was no significant difference in recovery time between two groups (p value = 0/131). Conclusion: In clinical practice, the agent of Nigella Sativa recovered as pustular from tissues of all patients. While the extract was as nearly effective as the standard drug, mupirocin, no side effect was observed.",

            "text": "S. aurous is the most common cause of pyogenic infection of skin and soft tissue; causing impetigo, cellulitis, abscess, omphalitis. These infections may lead to serious local and systemic complications. Most neonates are colonized within the first week of life with S. aurous. Mupirocin is a bactericidal ointment used against localized infection (1). However the developing microbial resistance to the existing antimicrobial agents has become a serious problem. Resistance to Mupirocin has been reported in many infectious incidences (1)(2). Therefore, production of new potent agents is urgently needed, especially for hospitals and health centers. It is well known that Seeds of Nigella sativa have been used for centuries as a traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases, including skin infections (2-3).",
