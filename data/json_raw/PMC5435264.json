            "text": "Background: The Union-Bloomberg Initiative tobacco control projects were implemented in Himachal Pradesh (a hilly state in North India) from 2007 to 2014. The project focused on the establishment of an administrative framework; increasing the capacity of stakeholders; enforcement of legislation; coalition and networking with multiple stakeholders; awareness generation with focus on earned media and monitoring and evaluation with policy-focussed research. This study aimed to systematically analyse all earned print news items related to the projects. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, quantitative content analysis of earned print news items was carried out using predetermined codes related to areas of tobacco control policies. We also carried out a cost description of the hypothetical value of this earned media. The area of the news item in cm 2 was multiplied by the average rate of space for the paid news item in that particular newspaper. Results: There were 6348 news items: the numbers steadily increased with time. Focus on Monitoring tobacco use, Protecting people from tobacco smoke, Offering help to quit, Warning about dangers of tobacco, Enforcing a ban on tobacco advertising and promotion, Raising tax on tobacco products was seen in 24, 17, 9, 23, 22 and 3% of news items, respectively. Press releases were highest at 44% and report by correspondents at 24%. Further, 55, 23 and 21% news items focused on smoking, smokeless and both forms of tobacco use, respectively. Sixty-six per cent and 34% news items, respectively, were focused on youth and women. The news items had a hypothetical value of US$1503 628.3, which was three times more than the funds spent on all project activities. Conclusions: In the absence of funding for paid media, the project strategically used earned media to promote tobacco control policies in the state."

[7][8][9] Earned media is one of the strategies under article 12 of FCTC guidelines on education, communication, training and public awareness. 10 Earned media is defined as any publicity which has not been paid and that is owned and created by a third party. 11 Traditionally, the term 'earned media' has been used when publicity is generated through public relations invested in targeting influencers to increase awareness about a brand, online and/ or offline. 11 Earned media has not been used much in tobacco control and most of the evidence is from the west, mostly dealing with increasing the demand for telephone or web-based quit lines 7 12-14 The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) with support from the Bloomberg Initiative To Reduce Tobacco Use (BI) supported tobacco control initiatives in a state in North India through a civil society partner. In close collaboration with the National Tobacco Control Programme at state and district levels, the project focussed on establishment of a politico-administrative and institutional framework; increasing capacity of stakeholders; enforcement of legislation; coalition and networking with multiple stakeholders; awareness generation and monitoring and evaluation with policy-focused research. Since there was no funding for public education and awareness generation including paid media, earned media in the form of print news items was used as a strategy for awareness generation on harms of tobacco, developing institutional framework, ensuring multistakeholder engagement, highlighting violations and strengthening enforcement of legislation.",

Therefore, we aimed to systematically analyse the trend, types of news items and hypothetical costs saved through all earned print news items in the state during the project. Specific objectives were to describe the earned print news items based on (1) year-wise trend; (2) type of news item: print release, report by correspondence, a feature article, a column or an editorial; (3) MPOWER focus area: Monitor, Protect, Offer, Warn, Enforce, Raise taxes; (4) focus area of tobacco control institutional infrastructure and framework as required under India's tobacco control programme; (5) intent of news item: whether antitobacco or protobacco and (6) hypothetical costs saved as a result of using earned media."

These predetermined codes were identified after brainstorming among the investigators. We also looked for tobacco industry (TI) interference (TII) and related issues like illicit trade and corporate social responsibilities (CSR). We also collected information on year of publication; name and language of newspaper. Coding was done by the same staff that collected the print news item.

Before this, a purposive sample of online earned media was studied, 14 including the effect of earned media in relation to activities specific to tobacco cessation. 7 12 13 We demonstrated how we used earned media strategically to further our cause of tobacco control in the state. The hypothetical value of earned print media (US$1503 628.3) was very significant (more than three times higher) when compared with the total expenditure of the project funded by The Union under the BI grants programme (\u2248US$470 000).  The study results are representative as all the news items were studied with no purposive or random sampling. We used STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for conduct and dissemination of study findings. 17 There were some limitations of this study. Each print news item was coded by one coder due to resource constraints. The role of subjectivity, despite 10% being rechecked, cannot be ruled out. It would be interesting to consider who was likely to be reading these print news items including the socio-demographic characteristics of readership. However, this literature is not available and was also beyond the scope of this study. Evidence in tobacco control is limited regarding the impact of earned print media coverage on behaviour, and therefore we have to be careful in assuming that newspaper coverage will have an impact on behaviour.",

            "text": "During 2007-08, there were no regular project activities. Limited print news items were due to occasional activities done by HPVHA (figure 1). After that, the increase in news items every year demonstrated the continued engagement with the print media, increase in activities under the project, increase in interest by newspapers and increased multistakeholder engagement with time. Press release was the most common type of news item. This showed that the project was proactive in media involvement for greater visibility. This was done with support from the public relations officer of the government, wherever possible, which added credibility to the project activities. Around one-third of the items were correspondence; this meant that the newspaper correspondents and reporters were interested to cover the news and the same interest was shown by the editorial board of the newspaper. The high proportion of news items dealing with the 'M' component of MPOWER could be explained by the fact that a series of compliance assessment studies were conducted in the state and widely disseminated. 18 19 The focus was minimum on 'R' (6%), perhaps because tobacco taxes were mainly the mandate of the central government with a small component of value added tax which may be levied by the state government. A majority of news items were against tobacco; this indicated that proper briefing of the media with all scientific evidences, best practices and tobacco industry tactics was done to tilt media support in favour of tobacco control. As far as type of tobacco use was concerned, around two-thirds of the news items highlighted smoking forms of tobacco use, which was also the most commonly used tobacco in the state as per the Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2009. 3 There was all-round coverage of issues related to institutional systems for tobacco control. (Table 1) The focus on establishing an institutional system is very important to ensure that tobacco control is sustainable and integrated with multistakeholder engagement. Further, even in the early phase of tobacco control in the state, TII, illicit trade of tobacco products and CSR activities by tobacco industry picked up and were highlighted by the media. A good number of news items also highlighted a fragmented and suboptimal approach of the state government which helped in initiating corrective actions by the government. The project was sensitive to the issue of tobacco use among youth and women as suggested by the sufficient focus on child/youth and women (Table 1).",

            "text": "There is limited evidence of the role of earned media in tobacco control; 7 12-14 however, earned media commands an important place in marketing, business and other fields. 20 21 It is often neglected because it is the one communication tool that requires working closely with the media and requires a good rapport, confidence building and tangible relationships with journalists, and raising legitimate concern with evidence-based and truthful information. 22 The same principles were followed by the project. Though paid media has been shown to be effective in tobacco control, the advantage of earned media lies in it being absolutely 'free' and getting something akin to a 'third party' testimonial. 11 17 There are some risks and challenges in the public health community using earned media. There is lack of control and difficulty in measuring effectiveness and it takes time, effort and requires investment in internal and external media content generation. There are also concerns about negative comments, misdirecting and reshaping of the message. Further, social media tools are already there and if earned media becomes more of a focus, in times to come there would be a need for consensus among the public health community on collection and assessment of data through social media tools. 14 During the course of the project, the state-level monitoring committee and district-level monitoring committees were constituted in all 12 districts of the state, with appointment of nodal officers. Enforcement teams/task forces were established at the state, district and subdistrict levels. Compliance with smoke-free laws ranged from 20% to 30% at baseline, which increased to around 85%. Advertisement and promotion of tobacco products decreased in all the districts of the state and overall compliance rates increased from 24 to 82%. The state of Himachal Pradesh was declared smoke free in July 2013 and progressed to become fully compliant with the country's tobacco control legislation along with advancing other provisions of the MPOWER policy package. During this process, the project strategically used earned media. However, this being a descriptive study, the exact effect of earned print media on compliance cannot be ascertained.",
