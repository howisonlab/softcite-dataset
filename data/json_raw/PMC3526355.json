The prepared right lung was removed and weighed (wet weight). After drying for >30 h at 60\u00b0C, the lung was weighed (dry weight) and the wet/dry weight ratio was calculated. Analysis of blood oxygenation and arterial blood pressure. Arterial blood gases and blood pressure were analyzed in conscious and resting mice. While anesthetized with isoflurane (2-2.5% in oxygen), mice were implanted with a polyethylene catheter into the left femoral artery. After applying two drops of 2% lidocaine solution (Streuli) to the wound, it was closed and mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia for 15 min while continuously recording blood pressure with a piezoelectric pressure transducer and a PowerLab system (ADInstruments). 100 \u00b5l blood was drawn from the catheter for blood gas and lactate measurements (AVL700 Radiometer). Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after drawing blood. Kinetics of the systolic arterial blood pressure were measured noninvasively using the BP-2000 Blood Pressure Analysis System (Visitech Systems). Statistics. Statistical significance was determined with an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test in Prism (GraphPad Software).

The blockade of PD-1-PD-L1-mediated inhibition is considered as a therapeutic approach to reinvigorate antiviral T cell responses. Yet previous studies reported that PD-L1-deficient mice develop fatal pathology during early systemic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, suggesting a host protective role of T cell down-regulation. As the exact mechanisms of pathology development remained unclear, we set out to delineate in detail the underlying pathogenesis. Mice deficient in PD-1-PD-L1 signaling or lacking PD-1 signaling in CD8 T cells succumbed to fatal CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology early after systemic LCMV infection. In the absence of regulation via PD-1, CD8 T cells killed infected vascular endothelial cells via perforin-mediated cytolysis, thereby severely compromising vascular integrity. This resulted in systemic vascular leakage and a consequential collapse of the circulatory system. Our results indicate that the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway protects the vascular system from severe CD8 T cell-mediated damage during early systemic LCMV infection, highlighting a pivotal physiological role of T cell down-regulation and suggesting the potential development of immunopathological side effects when interfering with the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway during systemic virus infections.",

In contrast, PD-1 KO mice did not succumb to a rapidly controlled LCMV infection when infected with 10 2 pfu of LCMV docile.

The emergence of disease symptoms simultaneously with the onset of the antiviral T cell response also suggested an involvement of virus-specific T cells. We found that depleting CD8 T cells entirely prevented disease development of infected PD-1 KO mice, whereas the depletion of CD4 T cells had no effect ( Fig. 1 D). These results indicated that PD-1 KO mice succumbed to a CD8 T cell-mediated pathology. A comparison of CD8 T cell responses in WT and PD-1 KO mice on day 6 p.i. revealed increased numbers of LCMV-specific CD8 T cells in the spleens of PD-1 KO mice and increased inflammatory infiltration of the periphery (liver) with virus-specific CD8 T cells, total CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and inflammatory polymorphonuclear cells (unpublished data). Consistent with an enhanced antiviral CD8 T cell response, PD-1 KO mice exhibited modestly improved virus control (unpublished data). PD-1 deficiency also resulted in elevated serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-\ue067, TNF, and IL-6 ( Fig. 1 E) and in moderately elevated serum concentrations of the liver aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared with infectionmatched WT mice (Fig. 1 F). In addition, only PD-1 KO mice suffered from focal hepatocellular necrosis in the form of visible lesion in liver tissue (unpublished data).",

This enabled us to obtain a PD-1-deficient 2009, 2010Nakamoto et al., 2009;Velu et al., 2009). This persistently high expression level was observed to be driven by the sustained presence of viral antigen (Bucks et al., 2009;Mueller and Ahmed, 2009) and to significantly contribute to T cell down-regulation, as the antibody-mediated blockade of PD-1-PD-L1 signaling partially restored the function of previously unresponsive T cells (Barber et al., 2006;Day et al., 2006;Blackburn et al., 2008). As viral persistence is supposed to be intimately linked to the down-regulation of antiviral T cell responses, restoring T cell function through the blockade of PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1 is considered as a therapeutic approach to treat HIV and persistent HCV infections in humans (Urbani et al., 2008;Nakamoto et al., 2009;Velu et al., 2009;Chiodi, 2010).",

A growing body of evidence from mouse model systems indicates that the impairment of the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway can cause aggravated if not lethal pathology during distinct infections (Iwai et al., 2003;Barber et al., 2006Barber et al., , 2011L\u00e1z\u00e1r-Moln\u00e1r et al., 2010;Mueller et al., 2010;Phares et al., 2010;Chen et al., 2011). Barber et al. (2006) showed that PD-L1 KO mice succumb to a systemic LCMV infection within 7 d, indicating a protective role of this pathway during the early phase of systemic infection. Likewise, Mueller et al. (2010) described a rapid development of fatal pathology in systemically infected mice that lacked PD-L1 expression on nonhematopoietic cells. Yet the pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to pathology development under conditions of PD-1-PD-L1 deficiency have remained elusive. It also remained unknown which specific nonhematopoietic cell type required PD-L1 expression to prevent fatal pathology.",

We determined the impact of impaired PD-1-PD-L1 signaling on early virus-directed immune responses and elucidated the immunological processes that lead to fatality. We found that pathology was driven by virus-specific CD8 T cells and depended on the expression of perforin. During systemic infection, endothelial cells strongly up-regulated PD-L1 expression on their cell surface which inhibited the killing of infected endothelial cells by virus-specific CD8 T cells. PD-1 deficiency or the Ab-mediated blockade of PD-L1 facilitated endothelial cell killing, leading to increased vascular permeability and ultimately to circulatory collapse.",

As the T cell effector cytokines IFN-\ue067 and TNF were measured in significantly monoclonal CD8 T cell population that was specific for the LCMV epitope GP33 (P14 cells). We adoptively transferred WT mice either with 10 4 PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 or PD-1 +/+ P14 cells, followed by a systemic LCMV infection. On day 6 p.i., mice were sacrificed and compared for the expansion and functional capacity of transferred CD8 T cell populations. We found that PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 P14 cells expanded to higher percentages and total numbers in the spleen compared with PD-1 +/+ P14 cells (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the percentage of IFN-\ue067-producing cells within transferred P14 cells was significantly higher when these were PD-1 deficient. This, in combination with a higher mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\ue067 in transferred PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 P14 cells (Fig. 2 B), suggested an increased functional capacity of PD-1-deficient virus-specific CD8 T cells on day 6 p.i. Accordingly, we found PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 P14-transferred WT mice to display higher serum concentrations of IFN-\ue067 (Fig. 2 C) and modestly improved virus control in the spleen compared with PD-1 +/+ P14-transferred WT mice (Fig. 2 D).

However, histological analysis of the liver, lung, kidney, heart, and brain did not reveal signs of notable organ damage in the form of apoptotic or necrotic regions apart from focal hepatocellular lesions and liver steatosis (unpublished data). The only moderate increase in AST levels ( Fig. 1 F), comparable serum albumin concentrations, and normal blood glucose concentrations in WT and PD-1 KO mice excluded acute liver failure (not depicted). We concluded that fatal pathology did not develop as a result of critical tissue damage in the above-mentioned vital organs.",

We determined the impact of CD8 T cell cytotoxicity on pathology development by treating WT and perforin-deficient mice (PKOB) with \ue061PD-L1. Although \ue061PD-L1-treated WT mice displayed the characteristic decline of core temperature on day 6 p.i., the core temperature in \ue061PD-L1-treated PKOB mice remained constant as in untreated PKOB mice ( Fig. 3 C). Importantly, we measured comparable percentages of splenic GP33specific CD8 T cells in \ue061PD-L1-treated WT and PKOB mice, indicating that the expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells was not impaired in perforin-deficient mice (unpublished data). Based on the severity and fast kinetics of pathology development, we speculated that recognition of virally infected nonhematopoietic cells by cytotoxic T cells would be involved. To test this hypothesis, we generated bone marrow chimeric mice that lacked H-2D b expression on nonhematopoietic cells through reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment of lethally irradiated H-2D b KO mice with WT bone marrow cells (WT\u2192H-2D b KO).

We, however, observed a significant reduction of vascular permeability in the lungs and livers of \ue061PD-L1-treated PKOB mice compared with \ue061PD-L1-treated WT mice (Fig. 6 F). Particularly in the lung, the \ue061PD-L1-mediated increase of vascular leakage was reduced by >66% in the absence of perforin.

Importantly, impaired PD-1-PD-L1 signaling had a stronger impact on endothelial cell killing in the presence of perforin than in PKOB mice, further corroborating the perforin-dependent endothelial cell apoptosis in vivo (Fig. 5 B). We also assessed the impact of impaired PD-1-PD-L1 signaling on the killing of infected endothelial cells by flow cytometry. Consistent with the above results, we found decreased total numbers of endothelial cells in the lungs of \ue061PD-L1-treated WT mice compared with untreated WT mice on day 6 p.i. (Fig. 5 C). In conclusion, these data demonstrate that endothelial cells from WT and PD-1 KO mice are permissive for LCMV during systemic infection and up-regulate PD-L1 under inflammatory conditions. This PD-L1 up-regulation inhibited life-threatening killing of virus antigen-presenting endothelial cells by activated CD8 T cells which was restored by PD-L1 blockade.",

We now describe a critical inhibitory role of this pathway for protecting the vascular system from CD8 T cell-mediated damage during systemic virus infection of mice. PD-1 deficiency or PD-L1 blockade both led to fatal pathology early after systemic LCMV infection. Pathology development was driven by PD-1 KO CD8 T cells, which exhibited significantly enhanced functionality compared with WT CD8 T cells. Although IFN-\ue067, TNF, and IL-6R signaling were dispensable for pathology development, perforin-mediated effector functions and nonhematopoietic H-2D b expression were crucially involved. We found that compromised PD-1-PD-L1 signaling enhanced endothelial cell killing by virus-specific CD8 T cells, leading to reduced endothelial cell numbers and increased vascular permeability. Consequently, infected PD-1 KO mice suffered from pulmonary edema and critical hypotension. These results suggest that PD-1-PD-L1-mediated inhibition of cytotoxic T cell activity protects from selfinflicted damage of the circulatory system during early systemic viral infection.",

(2010), who demonstrated that the absence of PD-L1 in nonhematopoietic cells resulted in fatality after systemic LCMV infection. However, we further delineated this mechanism by showing that PD-1 deficiency in CD8 T cells was sufficient for the development of fatal pathology and that this was linked to perforin-mediated effector functions. The above study also demonstrated that the absence of PD-L1 on hematopoietic cells led to fatal pathology, albeit with delayed kinetics. This very likely resulted from the documented increase in numbers and function of virus-specific CD8 T cells caused by the absence of down-regulation by PD-L1-deficient hematopoietic cells. Although our in vitro killing assays indicated that PD-L1 expression on endothelial cells confers a significant PD-1 KO mice suffer from pulmonary edema and severe hypotension Increasing vascular permeability can cause edema formation in the organ interstitium (Goldenberg et al., 2011;Matthay and Zemans, 2011). As significantly higher amounts of EB were extracted from PD-1 KO lungs than from WT lungs, we compared the extent of pulmonary edema formation on day 6 p.i. The wet/dry weight ratio of an organ increases with accumulating interstitial fluid. We observed significantly higher wet/dry weight ratios for lungs isolated from diseased PD-1 KO mice than from WT mice (Fig. 7 A). An additional breach of the endothelial barrier between vascular and alveolar space leads to the accumulation of plasma in the airways. This would result in elevated total protein concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Although protein concentrations were comparable in naive WT and PD-1 KO mice, infected PD-1 KO mice exhibited significantly more total protein in the BAL than infected WT mice (Fig. 7 B). This independently pointed toward the development of pulmonary edema in PD-1 KO mice in addition to the elevated wet/dry weight ratios. The increase of albumin in the BAL of PD-1 KO mice indicated exudation and not transudation as underlying mechanism (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore, the lungs of infected PD-1 KO mice exhibited focal intraalveolar hemorrhage ( Fig. 7 D), and histological sections of nonperfused lung tissue confirmed the extensive formation of interstitial edema with few regions of alveolar edema that were absent in sections of infected WT mice (Fig. 7 F). As previous results had suggested vascular permeabilization to be significantly dependent on perforin expression ( Fig. 6 F), BAL albumin concentrations were also determined in untreated and \ue061PD-L1-treated WT and PKOB mice. In contrast to treated WT mice, treated PKOB mice did not exhibit increased albumin concentrations in the BAL, whereas untreated mice exhibited comparably low levels (Fig. 7 E).",

Hence, a strong increase in numbers and function of virus-specific CD8 T cells in mice with PD-L1 deficiency on hematopoietic cells might overcome the threshold of PD-L1-conferred protection in endothelial cells. Unlike speculations in previous studies of immunopathology in PD-1-PD-L1 KO mice (Mueller et al., 2010; Phares et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011), we found that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an enzyme which is required for the generation of polymorphonuclear cellderived NOs, was described to significantly contribute to hepatic virus control after systemic LCMV infection and increased cerebral iNOS transcription coincided with elevated serum levels of nitrite/nitrate during lethal intracranial LCMV infection (Campbell et al., 1994;Campbell, 1996;Guidotti et al., 2000). To test for a possible role of polymorphonuclear cell-derived NOs in pathology development, we treated iNOS-deficient mice with \ue061PD-L1 followed by systemic LCMV infection. As seen with WT mice, the blockade of PD-1-PD-L1 signaling induced pathology development in infected iNOS-deficient mice on day 6 p.i., which indicated the dispensability of polymorphonuclear cell-derived NOs for pathology development (unpublished data). Moreover, the depletion of a major polymorphonuclear cell type, neutrophils, with a Ly-6G-targeting antibody did not prevent pathology development in infected PD-1 KO mice (unpublished data). Although our data strongly support a CD8 T cellmediated mechanism of immunopathology, other cell types, such as NK cells or NKT cells, also bear the potential of perforin-mediated cell lysis. Yet treatment of infected PD-1 KO mice with depleting \ue061NK1.1 antibody did not prevent pathology development (unpublished data).",

Although leaking plasma into organ interstitium can impair organ function, it can also affect the circulatory system. Increased vascular permeability and intravascular coagulation during endotoxic sepsis or hemorrhagic fever are associated with critical hypotension (Srikiatkhachorn, 2009;Goldenberg et al., 2011).

This was most prominent in the lung, perhaps because this organ has the largest endothelial area or because lung endothelium is more affected than other endothelia. The more modest extent of EB extravasation in organs of \ue061PD-L1-treated PKOB mice suggested a significant role of perforin in the increase of vascular permeability. However, the increase detected in the absence of perforin expression also indicated a contribution of additional factors. Potential mechanisms might be Fas/FasLand TRAIL/DR4/5-mediated killing of endothelial cells or alterations of endothelial cell adhesion through soluble mediators other than IFN-\ue067, TNF, or IL-6. Yet the level of vascular permeability observed in \ue061PD-L1-treated PKOB mice was insufficient to cause fatal pathology. The important role of perforin-mediated cell lysis in vascular permeabilization is in contrast to pathologies with similar clinical pictures, for example, sepsis, where inflammatory mediators were found to drive pathogenesis (Tracey et al., 1987;Leon et al., 1998;Shresta et al., 2006). Furthermore, pathogenic PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 P14 cells failed to increase vascular permeability in the lungs of nonhematopoietic H-2D b -deficient mice, whereas mice expressing nonhematopoietic H-2D b exhibited clearly increased vascular permeability. This observation indicated a central role of nonhematopoietic antigen presentation in the permeabilization of the pulmonary vasculature. A potential caveat of this experiment is the additional endogenous H-2D b -restricted CD8 T cell response in WT\u2192WT chimeric mice which is absent in WT\u2192H-2D b chimeras. However, endogenous T cells are subjected to strong PD-1-PD-L1-mediated down-regulation and likely exert a negligible impact on pathology development compared with the transferred 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 PD-1 \ue032/\ue032 P14 cells.",

Serum cytokine concentrations were measured using Cytometric Bead Array kits (BD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained raw data investigating the benefit of PD-1 blockade in the context of cancer treatment showed adverse events including pneumonitis (Brahmer et al., 2012;Topalian et al., 2012). Our results now highlight important aspects that might be worth considering for therapeutic approaches targeting the PD-1-PD-L1 pathway; although an increase of T cell function by PD-L1 blockade during the advanced phase of systemic LCMV infection improves virus control apparently devoid of clinically relevant immunopathology (Barber et al., 2006), PD-L1 blockade in the early phase of the same infection is lethal. This suggests divergent roles of PD-1-PD-L1-mediated immunoinhibition during distinct phases of the infection, being host-protective during the early phase but promoting pathogen persistence during the advanced phase. Accordingly, the timing of PD-L1 blockade might be crucial to avoid adverse side effects. Our data further indicate that the pathogen's biology and pathogen-specific aspects of the immune response have to be taken into consideration. Pathology could only be induced using LCMV inoculum doses that led to the systemic infection of endothelial cells at the time of extensive T cell expansion. Therefore, it is likely that the systemic nature of the infection, as well as a viral tropism which includes endothelial cells, is required to evoke the described pathology of the vascular system. This view is supported by a recent study describing a new infection model of a further endothelial cell-tropic Arenavirus, Lassa virus, where the infection of WT mice caused increased vascular permeability and edema formation with a strict CD8 T cell dependence of the pathology (Flatz et al., 2010). Interestingly, Lassa virus and LCMV share their cellular receptor, \ue061-Dystroglycan, which is expressed by endothelial cells (Kunz et al., 2001(Kunz et al., , 2005. Moreover, Lassa virus was shown to infect human and nonhuman primate endothelial cells (Lukashevich et al., 1999;Hensley et al., 2011), whereas the infection of nonhuman primates is associated with coagulopathy and hypotension (Fisher-Hoch et al., 1987). As the systemic LCMV infection of WT mice already caused a mild increase of vascular permeability and intravascular coagulation compared with naive WT mice, it can be speculated that PD-L1 blockade aggravates a clinically silent pathology during systemic LCMV infection which might have comparable pathophysiological mechanisms to those observed during Lassa virus infection.",
