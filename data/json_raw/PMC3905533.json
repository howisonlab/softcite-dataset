Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on 400 participants of Tehran University. A selfadministrated, anonymous questionnaire was used for data gathering. Findings: The mean age of students was 21.70 \uf0b1 2.73 years, and 92% of them were single. The prevalence of smoking was 27.3% including 35.4% of men and 12.6% of women (P < 0.001). The mean duration of smoking was 4.22 \uf0b1 3.05 years. There was a significant association between smoking behaviors among students and their age, gender, type of accommodation, field of study, income status, duration of study, and existence of smoking habits among family members. Conclusion: The prevalence of cigarette smoking among university students is high. The lack of adequate information about smoking related diseases indicates the incapability and inefficiency of educational programs on this issue.",

            "text": "Smoking is the risk factor of many diseases, and is also considered to be a major worldwide health issue. It is estimated that smoking and tobaccorelated illnesses lead to death of approximately 5.4 million people around the world annually. 1 This figure will reach 8.3 million in 2030 which will be the cause of 10 percent of mortalities globally. 2 Smoking still has a high prevalence among teenagers, and the age many begin to smoke is declining. 3 This behavior among university students is of high importance, since as an educated class of society they can impact all the population of society. Many studies have been implemented on the prevalence of smoking and its predisposing factors among university students. These studies indicate that the prevalence of smoking has a growing trend in universities. 4,5 Nazary et al. found that 43.5 percent of students started smoking after entering the university. 5 Currently, contrary to many countries, smoking in Public Places is not prohibited in Iran. Hence, smokers are under no social pressure to withdraw from smoking. Many Iranian studies have shown that the number of smoking people among community members, [6][7][8][9] academic educated population, 4,5,[10][11][12] and/or even school students [13][14][15] is growing. The above mentioned studies reported that between 11 to 15 percent of the population in Iran smoke.",

This rate was much lower than our results among the students of Tehran University. This point emphasized the necessity of conducting a more active approach in evaluation of and prevention from smoking among students.",

            "text": "Many studies have reported a higher prevalence of smoking among men than women which were in accordance with the present study. However, unlike the present study and similar Asian researches, this difference was not significant in Western Countries. 16 Moreover, some other factors were related to high prevalence of smoking among students including age, living in student homes instead of dormitories, education in fields of Art and Human Sciences, low GPA, prolonged education duration, having personal income and smoking members in their families. Living without parents (due to study in university) is associated with freedom of previous limitations which can lead to some considerable changes in an individual's life, particularly among students with lower awareness and knowledge. This situation can be more prominent due to economic independence and living alone. A similar result was obtained in Lebanon by Tamim et al. 17 This study showed that smoking is an easy way to reduce tension in the critical period of separation from family and individual autonomy. More prevalence of smoking in some majors (Art and Human Sciences fields) showed the lower knowledge of these groups. On the contrary, the students of Experimental Sciences (such as courses related to Medical Sciences) showed significantly lower prevalence of smoking. Although this difference between the students from different majors was not seen in some studies, 18 the need for effective education against smoking students has been raised in all of the studies. Raising awareness about smoking complications and side-effects, and its related diseases can prevent such an unhealthy behavior or it can even encourage them to withdraw from smoking. This subject emphasizes on identifying factors which influence the effectiveness of training programs in this field.",
