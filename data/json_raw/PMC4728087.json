Energy failure is due to insufficient ATP for a cell to maintain its cellular functions or defenses against oxidative stresses 32). Pathological events like ischemia cause necrosis but can also induce apoptosis 20). Severe oxidative stress causes necrosis, and milder stress causes apoptosis. Increased oxidative stress cause reduced ATP production in mitochondria, and this releases cytochrome C an AIF, which leads to apoptosis. Recent researches prove that activation of the cysteine protease caspases is critical for apoptosis in ischemia-induced brain injury 21). During apoptosis caspases are activated in the intracellular region and leads to degradation of cellular constituents; fi",

Oxidative stress and inflammation have an important role in cerebral infarction which mediated by ishemia and reperfusion 18,26) . Reperfusion injury stimulates many pathological mechanisms such as leukocyte infiltration, oxidative stress, inflammation, destruction of blood-brain barrier, platelet activation, nitric oxide release, and apoptosis 29,31,34) .

It is estimated that the stroke rate will rise significantly in the future 45) . During the stroke, several mechanisms are responsible for the neuronal injury including increased excitotoxicity, calcium overload, formation of free radicals and inhibition of protein synthesis 33,46) . During ischemia/reperfusion, resveratrol modulate the neurotransmitters and neuromodulator protects the brain from ischemia 17) . Li et al. 18) showed that treatment with resveratrol improve neurological function and decrease infarct volume as compared to ischemia rats. The neuroprotective mechanism of resveratrol are not clarified and further investigation must be conducted 18) . Apoptosis, inflammatory response, and free radical formation are responsible for the neuronal cell death. Apoptosis, a programmed cell death, activated by the cell ischemia 1) . A family of proteases known as caspases plays an important role in apoptosis. There are two ways of caspase activation : cell death receptor mediated and mitochondrial. The Bcl-2 family includes both antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl1, Boo/Diva, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Nrf3) and proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, Bok/Mtd) 17) . Cytochrome C induces cell    death by activation of caspase 9 and 3 in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis 4) . The mitochondrial release of cytochrome C in brain ischemia is caused by proapototic Bax gene, but it' s not the only way of apoptosis. Apoptosis can be activated in the absence of caspase activity. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is found in the mitochondrial intermembranous space, releases as a result of absence of ATP, causing apoptosis 3) .

            "text": "The present study indicates that resveratrol presents a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemic rats by measuring Annexin 5, p53, and bcl-2. Li et al. 19) indicated that resveratrol attenuates ischemic neuronal apoptosis by up regulating bcl-2. In our study after resveratrol administration, Bcl-2 levels were significantly increased when compared to the ishemia group. Shin et al. 38) showed that in the ischemic brain, resveratrol modulate the proteins and protects the brain. Annexin 5 has been extensively used as an indicator of early apoptosis due to its inherent property of selectively interacting with phosphatidyl serine. The physiologic functions of Annexin 5 include suppression of blood coagulation and platelet aggregation by occlusion of exposed PS from access by coagulation factors 37) . In our study we found that Annexin V levels were significantly increased in ischemia group compared to other groups. However, depending on the dose of resveratrol Annexin V levels did not change. Resveratrol affects the activation of a variety of intracellular signal pathways. Molchadsky et al. 27) showed that resveratrol induces p53 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs ). Unlike Molchadsky et al. 27) , Zheng et al. 50) showed that p53 decreased myocardin expression; hence inhibited differentiation from mesenchymal cells to smooth muscle cells. We observed that p53 levels decreases after the administration of resveratrol. Orsu et al. 30) indicated that resveratrol showed significant cerebroprotective action mediated by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Lu et al. 22) suggest that resveratrol prepared by RES loaded nanoparticles shows enhanced neuron protection against oxidative stress in cultured neurons exposed to H2O2 both in a short time and in longer time treatment over bax and bcl 2 genes.",
