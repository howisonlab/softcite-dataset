Design: Retrospective, comparative case series. Setting: Optical Express, Glasgow, UK. Methods: Patients treated between October 2015 and June 2016 (3972 LVC and 979 RLE patients) who attended 1-day and 1-month postoperative aftercare and answered a questionnaire were included in this study. All patients had a thorough preoperative discussion with an optometrist, watched a video consent, and were provided with written information. Patients then had a verbal discussion with their treating surgeon either PDOS or on the DOS, according to patient preference. Preoperative and 1-month postoperative visual acuity, refraction, preoperative, 1-day and 1-month postoperative questionnaire were compared between DOS and PDOS patients. Multivariate regression model was developed to find factors associated with patient's perception of consent quality. Results: Preoperatively, 8.0% of LVC and 17.1% of RLE patients elected to meet their surgeon ahead of the surgery day. In the LVC group, 97.5% of DOS and 97.2% of PDOS patients indicated they were properly consented for surgery (P=0.77). In the RLE group, 97.0% of DOS and 97.0% of PDOS patients stated their consent process for surgery was adequate (P=0.98). There was no statistically significant difference between DOS and PDOS patients in most of the postoperative clinical or questionnaire outcomes. Factors predictive of patient's satisfaction with consent quality were postoperative satisfaction with vision (46.7% of explained variance), difficulties with night driving, close-up vision or outdoor/sports activities (25.4%), visual phenomena (12.2%), dry eyes (7.5%), and patient's satisfaction with surgeon's care (8.2%). Conclusion: Perception of quality of consent was comparable between patients that elected to meet the surgeon PDOS, and those who did not.",

            "text": "Prior to elective surgery, patients need to be adequately informed of the benefits and inherent risks of the proposed treatment, possible outcomes, as well as surgical and nonsurgical alternatives to the recommended procedure. 1,2 As the number of procedures and their degree of technical complexity grow, delivering the correct information to the patient is becoming increasingly difficult. On one hand, patients should be informed in detail about their surgical procedure; on the other hand, overloading patients with too much technical/medical information may have unintended negative effects by confusing patients, reducing their ability to retain information, and impairing their ability to provide an informed decision. [1][2][3] Inadequate consenting process (combined with poor outcomes) is one of the most common reasons for malpractice litigation in ophthalmology. [4][5][6][7][8] This problem is particularly hard to overcome, as many publications have shown that very little information presented during informed consent is actually retained by the patient. [9][10][11][12][13] For this reason, numerous reports have studied the best way of communicating essential information to the patient. [1][2][3] This includes verbal discussion, use of videotaped presentation, and use of leaflets and written consent forms, allowing patients to digest information at their own pace. [14][15][16][17] In elective refractive surgery, such as laser vision correction (LVC), refractive lens exchange (RLE), or private cataract surgery, one of the issues is the role of the treating surgeon in the consent process, and whether medical personnel other than the treating physician can assist in the delivery of a high-quality and meaningful preoperative consent process. The ability to discuss a surgical procedure with patients of different backgrounds and different cognitive abilities can vary significantly from surgeon to surgeon. [15][16][17][18] In some cases, the physician's inability to explain a procedure in \"plain language\" results in poor understanding of the planned procedure, or an emotional barrier where patients might be reluctant or embarrassed to ask further questions. 16 Several clinical practices over the world have adopted a model where the preoperative discussion is performed by qualified clinical personnel, 19,20 with the aid of other tools, such as a video consent, 16,17 and/or plain-language written information, 14,17 with the intent to provide a uniform and thorough consent process. In this model, consent is a multistep process culminating with the surgeon.",

The patient was provided an information pack consisting of a copy of the informed consent document, written information about the procedure, preparation for the surgery day, and information on what to expect on the day of surgery and after the procedure. All patients watched an educational video, which reiterated the benefits, risks, and possible side effects of the proposed surgery. Patients who were candidates for RLE were required to attend another consultation where further measurements (biometry for lens calculation: IOLMaster; Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany; retinal optical coherence tomography: Cirrus 4000 OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG; and specular microscopy: SP 2000P specular microscope; Topcon, Co., Tokyo, Japan) were performed.

A robust consent process is therefore required to educate the patient and provide them with the information they need to make an informed decision whether to proceed. Literature agrees that better communication increases patient satisfaction and reduces the number of malpractice suits. [21][22][23] Verbal communication with the treating physician alone, however, does not guarantee that the patient will be satisfied with the consenting process. [14][15][16][17][18] A surgeon's verbal discussion cannot be easily standardized, as it is extremely patient-directed. 16,17 Some publications previously have highlighted the difficulties in performing consent by treating ophthalmologist in busy clinical practices. [14][15][16][17][18] Ophthalmologist may need to consent several patients a day, which often results in a rote and mechanical discussion that may not fully educate the patient. 15,16 If the preoperative consent discussion was performed only by the surgeon, without the help of other medical personnel or other audio/visual aides, a longer appointment time would be needed, which could result in a reduced availability of consultations and reduced affordability of the procedure. As a result, fewer patients may have access to the surgery.",

DOS, only 2 patients remembered all five main risks outlined preoperatively, whereas 11 patients remembered no risks at all. Remaining patients only remembered some of the risks. Dhingra and colleagues 10 questioned 82 patients undergoing elective phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. All patients received standardized verbal and written information 2 weeks prior to surgery. Only one-third of the patients could correctly recollect the consent information DOS. Priluck et al 11 questioned 100 patients undergoing a scleral buckling procedure about their informed consent discussion. As little as 23% of patients retained some information of the surgical risks, concluding that patients are likely to remember only the information that seems to be in favor of their decision to have surgery.",

            "text": "To overcome the problem of poor preoperative discussion recollection, several consenting approaches have been proposed, which mostly consist of combination of written, verbal, and audiovisual information. [1][2][3][14][15][16][17] For example, Moseley et al 15 evaluated the effect of presentation methods on understanding of cataract surgery and showed that subgroup of patients who watched educational video had significantly better understanding of the risks and benefits of the procedure. In a similar study, Wollinger et al 16 used multimedia software to improve patients' understanding of cataract surgery, in addition to verbal consent. This interactive tool presented cataract surgery using simple images and a clear spoken voice, allowing patients to process information in their own time. Patients who watched the video had significantly better understanding of cataract surgery than patients in control group. Authors attributed this to basic concepts of learning, where all senses have to be engaged in order to memorize presented information: they state  that only 10%-15% of the read material, 25% of the heard material, and 40% of the seen images are kept in memory over the long term. This increases to 75% when all senses are used simultaneously. 24 Numerous other studies from all areas of medicine confirmed that use of audiovisual tools can significantly enhance patients understanding of their medical condition or proposed surgical procedure. [24][25][26][27][28] The informed consent process in our practice is very standardized, and the optometrist plays a key role. This includes discussing patient-specific potential risks, range of outcomes, and alternatives. In addition, the optometrist discusses the content of the educational video after the patient has viewed it as well as addressing any patient questions or concerns. The surgeon then reiterates all this information either DOS or PDOS, according to patient's choice. There are specific declarations within the electronic medical records system that document these discussions which have been completed and signed by the optometrist, the surgeon, and the patient.",

Perhaps not surprisingly, the patient's satisfaction with the outcome of their procedure was the strongest predictor, accounting for 46.7% of variance explained by the regression model. Other significant predictors were also associated with quality of vision such as postoperative difficulties with night driving, close-up vision, sports or outdoor activities (25.4% explained variance), visual phenomena (12.2% explained variance), and ocular comfort (7.5% explained variance). Satisfaction with surgeon's care and the surgeon answering all questions (regardless of whether patient has met the surgeon PDOS or DOS) was also a statistically significant factor in regression analysis, responsible for 8.2% of variance explained by the regression model.",

This agrees with literature, where the consent process is one of the most common causes of malpractice suits; [4][5][6][7][8] however, it is rarely the primary cause of litigation in ophthalmology. 18 It is the negative outcome that initiates litigation, with the lack of adequate consent used as a secondary factor in majority of ophthalmology malpractice cases. 18 Despite a thorough preoperative explanation and repetition of information in the consent process, there will probably be some patients who will not retain, [9][10][11][12][13] or even deny ever hearing, the information presented to them preoperatively. 11 Some patients who are strongly determined to undergo refractive surgery might selectively process the information they hear, remembering only the positive facts, and unwilling to accept or pay attention to any adverse side effects. 11,16,18 There is also a possibility that the patients were truly not sufficiently informed about the risks of the procedure. In our practice, the likelihood of negative outcome is presented to all patients in multiple ways, including written information, audiovisual tools, and a minimum of two verbal discussions (optometrist and surgeon). Additionally, patients sign a declaration after each consent step confirming that the information was presented to them. However, the intention of the study was not to understand why patients do not feel they were properly consented, but rather to analyze whether meeting the surgeon PDOS or DOS affected their perception of the consent 1 month after surgery, and this was not found to be a significant factor in the regression analysis.",

Our results show that a discussion with the treating physician on either DOS or PDOS has no effect on the patient's perception of the quality of their consent, their postoperative satisfaction, or visual outcomes. The study outcome does not diminish the value of the surgeon in consenting process, but rather highlights that trained eye care specialists can perform an important supporting role in the consent process.",
