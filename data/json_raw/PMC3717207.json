We describe a program, the Sanger Institute Mouse Genetics Project, that provides a step toward the aim of knocking out all genes and screening each line for a broad range of traits. We found that hitherto unpublished genes were as likely to reveal phenotypes as known genes, suggesting that novel genes represent a rich resource for investigating the molecular basis of disease. We found many unexpected phenotypes detected only because we screened for them, emphasizing the value of screening all mutants for a wide range of traits. Haploinsufficiency and pleiotropy were both surprisingly common. Forty-two percent of genes were essential for viability, and these were less likely to have a paralog and more likely to contribute to a protein complex than other genes. Phenotypic data and more than 900 mutants are openly available for further analysis.",

Despite the dramatic increase in the knowledge of variation in human genomes, the normal function of many genes is still unknown or predicted from sequence analysis alone, and consequently, the disease significance of rare variants remains obscure. Furthermore, there remains a large bias toward research on a small number of the best-known genes (Edwards et al., 2011). Realizing the full value of the complete human genome sequence requires broadening this focus, and the availability of comprehensive biological resources will facilitate this process.",

Genetic studies in mice, mostly via targeted mutagenesis in ES cells, have described a function for 7,229 genes (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax. org/pub/reports/MGI_PhenotypicAllele.rpt, February 2013). The vast majority of these studies have been directed at previously studied (known) genes, driven by previous biological knowledge. Phenotype-driven screens have also identified genes associated with specific phenotypes, although to a smaller extent. Although targeted mutagenesis has been very successful, the global distribution of the effort has resulted in significant heterogeneity in allele design, genetic background of mice used, and their phenotypic analysis. Furthermore, the biological focus of most targeted knockout experiments is constrained by the expertise of the specific research group. As a result, many phenotypes have not been detected, and consequently, the full biological function of many genes studied using knockout mice is significantly underreported.",

The Sanger Institute's Mouse Genetics Project (MGP) was one of the first programs to pursue this objective, established in 2006 when the first targeted ES cells became available. The MGP later expanded to contribute to a European phenotyping effort, EUMODIC, and more recently has become a founding member of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC). Summaries of the developing efforts and aspirations of the IMPC have been reported (e.g., Brown and Moore, 2012;Ayadi et al., 2012). As the first established large-scale project using the KOMP/EUCOMM ES cells, the MGP has provided pilot data to inform the design of the international effort, such as the advantages of a single pipeline design, optimum numbers of mice, and details of variance for specific phenotyping tests. To date, the MGP has generated more than 900 lines of mutants using KOMP/EUCOMM resources (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/), and here, we describe the analysis of 489 of these for viability and fertility and 250 lines that have passed through a systematic screen for adult phenotypes, providing a glimpse into the wealth of biological insight that will emerge from these programs. Publicly available data enable the construction of new hypotheses, and the mouse mutants provide an invaluable resource for followup studies.",

All mutant lines generated passed through all primary phenotypic screens. For most tests in the pipeline, seven males and seven females were used, tested in small batches so that the data for each genotype were gathered on different days ( Figure S2A). Assays culminated in the collection of samples at 16 weeks of age (Table S4). The primary screen included a high-fat diet challenge to exacerbate any latent phenotypes. Separate pipelines included challenges with two infectious agents: Salmonella Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium (Table S4).",

To make robust phenotypic calls, a reference range method was implemented that uses accumulated wild-type (WT) data to identify and refine the 95% reference range (Figure S2B). Mutant data were compared to the relevant reference range and variant phenotypes determined using a standardized set of rules ( Figure S3). We aimed to highlight phenotypes with large effect sizes. This approach results in conservative calls and minimizes false positives. There was very little missing data (2.14% of all calls; Table S2). The maximum number of parameters collected per line was 263. Of these, 147 were categorical variables, for example normal or abnormal teeth, whereas 116, such as plasma magnesium levels, exhibited a continuous distribution from which outliers were identified. Examples of parameters with continuous variables (cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL], low-density lipoprotein [LDL], mean weights, and auditory brainstem responses [ABR]) are illustrated in Figure 3.",

Body weight and fat/lean composition were among the most common anomalies, with both overweight (n = 2) and underweight (n = 21) mutants discovered. The Kptn mutant is an example of an unexpected phenotype. Kptn is a putative actin binding protein proposed as a candidate for deafness because it is expressed in sensory hair cells (Bearer et al., 2000). Instead, the homozygous Kptn mutant has increased body weight on a high-fat diet ( Figure 4A) and increased bacterial counts following Salmonella Typhimurium challenge but normal hearing (Table S2). Additional new phenotypes were detected in genes that had been published previously, such as reduced grip strength and ankylosis of the metacarpophalangeal joints in Dnase1l2 mutants (Fischer et al., 2011), delayed response in the hot plate test in Git2 mutants (Schmalzigaug et al., 2009), and small sebaceous glands in Cbx7 mutants (Forzati et al., 2012) (Figures 4B-4E, 4G, and 4H). Phenotypes were also detected in genes that had not been published previously, such as impaired hearing in Fam107b mutants and elevated plasma magnesium concentration in Rg9mtd2 mutants (Figures 4F and 4I,respectively). These examples demonstrate that many phenotypes will be missed unless they are specifically looked for and illustrate the value of carrying out a broad range of screens with all mutants going through all screens. They also reveal our collective inability to predict phenotypes based on sequence or expression pattern alone.",

Importantly, for 56 genes, a new phenotype was detected by our screen (column K, Table  S5). For 31 genes, features of the published phenotype were assessed but not detected by our pipeline. For example, Asxl1 tm1Bc/tm1Bc mice are published as being viable (Fisher et al., 2010), but we found that Asxl1 tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi homozygotes were lethal, with none detected among 276 progeny from heterozygous intercrosses (c 2 = 95.13, df = 2; p < 2.2 3 10 \u00c016 ).

Approximately half (27) of these mutants exhibited phenotypes that were broadly consistent with the human phenotype. However, many additional phenotypes were detected in the mouse mutants suggesting additional features that might also occur in patients that have hitherto not been reported. Interestingly, a large proportion of genes underlying recessive disorders in humans are homozygous lethal in mice (17 of 37 genes), possibly because the human mutations are not as disruptive as the mouse alleles. Of the 59 genes, 26 represent the first mouse mutant with publicly available data. Three examples (Sms, Ap4e1, and Smc3) representing the first targeted mouse mutant for each gene are illustrated in Figure 6, and all show similar phenotypic features to their human counterparts.",

Given that certain phenotypic features would be expected to co-occur frequently, reflecting physiological or developmental associations, a principal component analysis was conducted to look for correlated patterns in the data. Plotting principal component 1 against 2 revealed four main clusters of mouse lines (colored ovoids in Figure 5D). The separation along principal component 2 arises from viability. The remaining separation of clusters marked by red and green from clusters marked blue and yellow ( Figure 5D) arises from body weight and associated variables, including DEXA measurements and energy use ( Figure 5E). Body weight is a common covariable in disease (Reed et al., 2008), so it is not surprising that it dominates the principal component analysis.",

Previous analyses of published data on mouse knockouts did not find a significant difference in essential genes between singleton and duplicated genes (Liang and Li, 2007;Liao and Zhang, 2007). However, the published gene set is biased toward genes involved in development (Makino et al., 2009).

Homozygous Viability and Fertility Overview (A) Homozygous viability at P14 was assessed in 489 EUCOMM/KOMP targeted alleles. A minimum of 28 live progeny were required to assign viability status. Lines with 0% homozygotes were classed as lethal, >0% and %13% as subviable, and >13% as viable. (B) Comparison of homozygous viability data from targeted alleles carrying either a promoter-driven or promoterless neomycin selection cassette. (C) Lines classed as lethal or subviable at P14 were further assessed for viability at E14.5. Of the 205 targeted alleles eligible for this recessive lethality screen, 143 are reported here. A total of 28 embryos were required to assign viability status, and outcomes were categorized by both the number and dysmorphology of homozygous offspring. (D) A basic dysmorphology screen encompassing 12 parameters was performed on all embryos for the 75 targeted alleles classed as viable or subviable at E14.5. A total of 34 targeted alleles showed one or more abnormality, and the percentage incidence is presented. (E-G) Examples of E14.5 dysmorphology (arrowheads indicate abnormalities) are presented. Homozygous progeny were detected at a Mendelian frequency in all three examples. Sixty-seven percent (six of nine) Mks1 tm1a/tm1a embryos presented with edema, polydactyly, and eye defects (E). Sixty-two percent (five of eight) Spnb2 tm1a/tm1a embryos presented with edema and hemorrhage (F). Eighty-six percent (six of seven) Psat1 tm1a/tm1a embryos presented with growth retardation, exencephaly, and craniofacial abnormalities (G). (H) Fertility was assessed in homozygous viable lines (307 mouse lines assessed from a total of 331 eligible lines). At least four independent 6-week-old mice of each sex were mated for a minimum of 6 weeks, and if progeny were born, the line was classed as fertile, regardless of if the progeny survived to weaning. Of note is the strong skew toward male (blue circle) fertility issues (15 of 16 genes) compared to 4 of 15 genes that displayed female (red circle) fertility issues. See also Table S3. CORUM database (Ruepp et al., 2010). We found that genes with a human ortholog that is part of a complex were significantly more likely to be essential (Table S3; Figure 7B).",

            "text": "There is a large bias in the literature toward analysis of known genes (Edwards et al., 2011), but are genes that have yet to be examined experimentally less likely to underlie disease? Genes in our set that had no associated publications (other than highthroughput genome-wide reports) were compared with genes where some aspect of their function had been described. The proportion of essential genes among the novel set was not significantly different from the known genes ( Figure 7C). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the number of hits observed per line between known and novel genes (Tables S2 and S3). As a second test, we asked if genes with orthologs involved in human disease (having an OMIM disease ID) were enriched in essential genes or the number of phenotypic hits compared with genes not (yet) ascribed to human disease, but there was no significant difference (Tables S2 and S3; Figure 7D). Finally, we compared genes that had been proposed for inclusion by the community (n = 87) with those with no specific request to ask if genes of interest to the community were more likely to be essential or to have detected phenotypes. There was no significant difference between the two groups (Table S3). Thus, known genes are no more likely to be involved in disease than novel genes, emphasizing that much new biology will be uncovered from the analysis of mutations in novel genes.

However, until recently, these studies have been conducted by individual laboratories and largely directed at previously studied genes. The focused collection of phenotypic information from these mutants has been very information rich, but many aspects remain undetected because they are outside the area of interest of the laboratory generating the mutant. Individual endeavors have led to wide variation in allele design and genetic backgrounds used, and all too often, the mutant is not available to other groups for further analysis. In contrast, the mutant mice described here have the advantage of a common genetic background and a Figure 5. Characteristics of Phenotypic Hits Detected (A) Distribution of the number of phenotypic hits in each line screened as homozygotes showing the peak at no hits but a long tail of lines with multiple hits up to 41. (B) Distribution of hits in lines screened as heterozygotes; all lines had at least one hit (for viability) with a spread up to 14 hits.

Several of the mutants have been analyzed further following an initial phenotypic observation in the screen, and these add to the depth of our knowledge of biological mechanisms of disease (e.g., Nijnik et al., 2012;Crossan et al., 2011). As the assembled data expands, it will become possible to discern patterns between phenotypes and come to more holistic conclusions about categories of genes. Genes linked by common phenotypes can be grouped together to test for regulatory or other functional interactions and ultimately placed into pathways that in turn will implicate other genes in the disease process. For example, of the four genes associated with abnormal fasting glucose levels in our data set, Slc16a2 can be linked to Ldha via regulation of L-triiodothyronine (Friesema et al., 2006;Miller et al., 2001), but the other two genes, Nsun2 and Cyb561, have no reported regulatory links apart from in vitro protein-protein interactions, so these represent candidates to investigate further. Already some broad conclusions can be drawn from the data set, such as the value of analyzing novel genes, the increased incidence of essentiality in genes with no paralog, and the increased number of genes required for male compared to female fertility. Many completely unexpected associations between genes and phenotypes have been discovered, illustrating the value of a broad-based screen.",

The null allele will give insight into the temporal and spatial requirements for the gene and will contribute to the establishment of gene networks involved in mammalian disease processes. Furthermore, our data set demonstrates that many features of human Mendelian diseases can be found in the corresponding mouse mutant. The mouse alleles studied here are expected to be null alleles or strong hypomorphs, which may not always reflect the consequence of the human mutation. However, null alleles should reveal haploinsufficiency and recessive effects due to deleterious mutations such as frameshift and nonsense mutations. Null alleles in the mouse are likely to make the largest impact upon understanding human diseases caused by rare variants of large effect size. Complex multifactorial diseases, which may depend on human-specific variants with small effect size or more specific molecular effects such as gain-offunction mutations, will require more customized approaches such as knockin of specific human mutations. Alternative approaches using the mouse for discovering loci underlying complex disease include the Hybrid Mouse Diversity panel and the Collaborative Cross (reviewed by Flint and Eskin, 2012).",

The Clinical Phenotyping Pipeline optimized here has been adopted by several other programs within the IMPC; multiple groups are now working together to extend what is described in this report for 250 genes to 5,000 genes over the next 4 years with the vision that this will eventually cover all protein-coding genes. The primary phenotypes and genetic resources emerging from these programs will make a significant contribution to our understanding of mammalian gene function.",
