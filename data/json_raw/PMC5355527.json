This study was carried out to investigate the job stress, job satisfaction, and workforce productivity levels, to examine the effects of job stress and job satisfaction on workforce productivity, and to identify factors associated with productivity decrement among employees of an Iranian petrochemical industry. Methods: In this study, 125 randomly selected employees of an Iranian petrochemical company participated. The data were collected using the demographic questionnaire, Osipow occupational stress questionnaire to investigate the level of job stress, Job Descriptive Index to examine job satisfaction, and Hersey and Goldsmith questionnaire to investigate productivity in the study population. Results: The levels of employees' perceived job stress and job satisfaction were moderate-high and moderate, respectively. Also, their productivity was evaluated as moderate. Although the relationship between job stress and productivity indices was not statistically significant, the positive correlation between job satisfaction and productivity indices was statistically significant. The regression modeling demonstrated that productivity was significantly associated with shift schedule, the second and the third dimensions of job stress (role insufficiency and role ambiguity), and the second dimension of job satisfaction (supervision). Conclusion: Corrective measures are necessary to improve the shift work system. \"Role insufficiency\" and \"role ambiguity\" should be improved and supervisor support must be increased to reduce job stress and increase job satisfaction and productivity."

            "text": "The nature of work has changed considerably in many sectors of industry over the past decades [1]. Modern organizations consider job stress and job satisfaction of their employees as two important workplace issues [2]. According to recent studies, occupational stress accounts for 50e60% of all lost working days [3]. Workrelated stress is considered to be harmful when physical and emotional responses occur when there is a mismatch between job requirements and the workers' capabilities, resources, or needs [4]. Most researchers agree that workplace factors can cause workrelated stress [5]. These factors are divided into physical and psychosocial hazards. Exposure to physical hazards in the workplace can be associated with anxiety that, in turn, drives experiencing work-related stress. Psychosocial hazards include factors related to work design, organization, and management, together with workplace social structure that can have negative effects on individuals [6]. Work-related stress usually influences individual and organizational issues including behavioral, mental, as well as physical outcomes, performance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment [7].",

When functioning as a motivator, work-related stress results in creativity and satisfaction and consequently removes boredom and mundanity. Stress leads to aggression and low job satisfaction when it functions as a negative factor [2]. Job satisfaction may protect workers from stressors. Satisfaction is a regulating factor for stress. During the neoclassical period (1920e1950), theories supported the fact that employees' satisfaction directly affected productivity. They believed that there was a cause-effect relationship between satisfaction and productivity. This answered the question why organizations tried to improve their employees' productivity by different ways. These two factors (work-related stress and job satisfaction) may have a negative impact on the productivity of a working group and consequently cause an added cost to expenses of a company [2]. The analysis of the present situation at the international level has revealed, among others, the necessity of improving work quality and productivity, as well as providing safety and health in the work place [12].",

Occupational stress was measured by six subscales, i.e., role overload, role insufficiency, role ambiguity, role boundary, responsibility, and physical environment. Each subscale contains 10 items. There are 60 items in total in the scale. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 \u00bc never, 2 \u00bc occasionally, 3 \u00bc sometimes, 4 \u00bc usually, and 5 \u00bc most of the time). A high subscale score depicts a greater level of role stressor. The obtained scores are classified as: low (10e19), low-moderate (20e29), moderate-high (30e39), and high (40e50) [14]. The total score of the job stress questionnaire is also divided into four levels, as follows: low (60e119), low-moderate (120e179), moderate-high (180e239), and high (240e 300) [14]. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were assessed in a study by Sharifian et al [15] and cronbach alpha coefficient was calculated to be 0.83; (3) the Persian version of Job Descriptive Index (JDI) was used to investigate job satisfaction. The JDI consists of 39 items in five subscales, i.e., work (10 items), pay (6 items), promotion (5 items), supervision (8 items), and coworkers (10 items). Each part measures one particular area of job satisfaction. A response was collected to each item on a 5-point Likert scale (1 \u00bc never, 2 \u00bc occasionally, 3 \u00bc often, 4 \u00bc usually, and 5 \u00bc most of the time). The scores of each subscale were added together for each respondent to obtain a JDI total score reflecting the overall job satisfaction. No cutoff point has been reported to define the upper and the lower limits of job satisfaction index in the scientific literature, therefore, we used the minimum and the maximum attainable scores of JDI (39e195) to judge about the level of job satisfaction in the study population. Regarding this, if the mean score of JDI was near the lower limit score (39), near the midpoint (117), and near the upper limit score (195), job satisfaction was considered as low, moderate, and high, respectively. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were assessed in a study by Norbakhsh and Mirnaderi in which the cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.88 [16]; and (4) the Persian version of the Hersey and Goldsmith questionnaire was applied to investigate workers' productivity. This questionnaire consists of 26 items in seven subscales: ability (3 items), occupational identification (4 items), organization support (4 items), motivation (4 items), performance feedback (4 items), credit (4 items), and environment compatibility (3 items). Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1 \u00bc never, 2 \u00bc occasionally, 3 \u00bc often, 4 \u00bc usually, and 5 \u00bc true most of the time). Similar to JDI, no cut-off point has been indicated to define the upper and the lower limits for productivity index in the scientific literature, therefore, the minimum and the maximum attainable scores of this index (29e130) were used to judge about the level of productivity of the study population. Based on this, if the mean score of productivity score was near the lower limit score (29), near the midpoint (79.5), and near the upper limit score (130), productivity was considered as lower, moderate, and high, respectively. The validity and reliability of this questionnaire were assessed in a study by Nasirpour et al [17] in which the cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.81.",

This finding is in agreement with the results of other studies [23,24]. One possible reason is that young people are highly motivated during the first years of employment which can lead to a high job satisfaction. This level of job satisfaction declines during the middle years of employment due to job repetitiveness and job restrictions; after this period, job satisfaction continuously increases with age [24]. This increase is justified based on Herzberg's \"modified expectation\" theory. On the basis of this theory, when age and job experience increase, the individual's expectations of her/his work begin to become more realistic. This may result in job satisfaction increment. In a study, a direct linear relationship was reported between age and job satisfaction which was not in agreement with Herzberg's hypothesis of the U-shaped relationship between these variables [25].",

This finding is similar to a study by Wu et al [32]. In this study, role insufficiency was determined as one of the factors which had a direct and significant impact on depression. Depression is a common mental health problem in the world which increases employees' absenteeism and reduces productivity [32].

Role ambiguity is a state during which individuals have no clear and direct understanding about their roles in the organization [34]. It appears when the duties are not clearly defined for the individual and she/he is frightened of doing things or accepting responsibility. Role stressors mainly include role ambiguity and role conflict which can lead to increased employees absenteeism and frequent work delays, increase in employees' turnover and reduced workforce productivity [35]. In a study by Rizwan et al, a significant positive relationship was observed between role ambiguity and job stress such that role ambiguity was reported to cause 15% increase in job stress [28]. Increased job stress is accompanied with reduced performance and job satisfaction, which finally leads to lower productivity of individuals and increased costs incurred by the organization [2]. The results of the regression modeling indicated that supervision could have an effective role in increasing productivity, which was in agreement with the results of a study by Frimpong et al [36]. In this study, a strong interaction was reported between the workers' perceived supervisor support and productivity, in such a way that workers who were not supported by their supervisors had lower productivity as compared to those who were provided with adequate support [36]. Providing appropriate support in the workplace by the supervisor would cause reduced stress on the individuals and protect her/him against adverse effects of job demands, job dissatisfaction, and depression [33].",
