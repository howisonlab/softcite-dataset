            "text": "This study aimed to classify distinct subgroups of people who use both smartphone and the internet based on addiction severity levels. Additionally, how the classified groups differed in terms of sex and psychosocial traits was examined. Methods: A total of 448 university students (178 males and 270 females) in Korea participated. The participants were given a set of questionnaires examining the severity of their internet and smartphone addictions, their mood, their anxiety, and their personality. Latent class analysis and ANOVA (analysis of variance) were the statistical methods used. Results: Significant differences between males and females were found for most of the variables (all P,0.05). Specifically, in terms of internet usage, males were more addicted than females (P,0.05); however, regarding smartphone, this pattern was reversed (P,0.001). Due to these observed differences, classifications of the subjects into subgroups based on internet and smartphone addiction were performed separately for each sex. Each sex showed clear patterns with the three-class model based on likelihood level of internet and smartphone addiction (P,0.001). A common trend for psychosocial trait factors was found for both sexes: anxiety levels and neurotic personality traits increased with addiction severity levels (all P,0.001). However, Lie dimension was inversely related to the addiction severity levels (all P,0.01). Conclusion: Through the latent classification process, this study identified three distinct internet and smartphone user groups in each sex. Moreover, psychosocial traits that differed in terms of addiction severity levels were also examined. It is expected that these results should aid the understanding of traits of internet and smartphone addiction and facilitate further study in this field.",

            "text": "Internet addiction is defined as the inability to control one's internet use and is a condition that results in the serious impairment of various life functions. [1][2][3][4] Over the last 2 decades, the global internet-using population has grown to almost 2.5 billion. 5 It is an undeniable fact that internet brings many benefits to our lives. However, emerging evidence associated with various negative consequences indicates that excessive internet use can be problematic for some individuals. 6,7 The psychological consequences involve the following: obsession for the internet or internet gaming; imbalance of real-life relationships, sleep, work, and education; [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] increased aggression, hostility, and stress; 8,16,17 problems with verbal memory and attention; 8,17,18 maladaptive coping strategies; 8,19,20 and low wellbeing and high loneliness. 21 In addition, psychosomatic and neuro-anatomic studies on internet addiction have been accumulated to widen the understanding of the possible relationship between brain alteration and internet addiction. 8,22 Although discrepancies in measurements, as well as the different cutoff points, reliability problems of self-reporting formats, and culturally limited studies, make some researchers still cast doubt on diagnosis of internet addiction, the disorder is now considered as one of the behavior addictions. 23,24 Indeed, in May 2013, internet addiction was included in an appendix of the newly updated version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a new term, \"internet Gaming Disorder.\" This would indicate the fact that the American Psychiatric Association has officially approved internet gaming disorder as a condition that requires consideration of clinicians and researchers, like other behavioral addictions. 25 Furthermore, as development of internet-based smart-mobile devices increases, the significance of this research is likely to increase.",

            "text": "With abundant applications, smartphones provide users with internet-based communication, business trading, education, entertainment media, and even clinical applications. Given their variety of functions and ease of use, the number of estimated global users was more than 1.08 billion in early 2012, and it is increasing with great speed. However, smartphones can be problematic when used excessively. For example, excessive smartphone use can cause maladaptive behavioral difficulties seen in impulse control disorders in general or pathological gambling; it can interfere with school or work, 26 decrease real-life social interaction, decrease academic ability, cause relationship problems, 27 and cause physical health-related problems including blurred vision and pain in the wrists or the back of the neck. 28 Most behaviors performed under conscious control are selected to fulfil one's social, functional, and psychological needs. Therefore, when a behavior brings a satisfaction to an individual, it is actively continued and habituated. In this sense, it is difficult to simply class habitual smartphone usage as an addiction-like behavior. However, according to previous studies, 29,30 problematic smartphone use could be included in the behavior addiction category when the following components of addiction are taken into consideration: 1) the individual is preoccupied with a specific behavior (smartphone use); 2) the behavior is used in order to escape reality or create a feeling of euphoria; 3) as the behavior is continued, tolerance develops; 4) when the behavior is abstained or interfered with, withdrawal symptoms occur (feeling anxious, depressed, or irritable); 5) as a consequence of the continuous behavior, interpersonal problems occur; and 6) individual experiences relapse against one's will. Previous studies have indeed found that smartphones are addictive for users and are closely attached to their lives. A Taiwanese study of 10,191 adolescents reported that 30% of participants exhibited tolerance, 36% exhibited withdrawal, 27% exhibited use that was heavier than intended, 18% made unsuccessful attempts to reduce, and 10% experienced functional impairment of close relationships. 31 It is true that many authorities carefully acknowledge that there certainly is a risk of addiction due to the excessive use or misuse of a smartphone. However, because of the limited findings, which lack a validated standard, nothing about smartphone addiction or the characteristics of problematic users has yet been clearly concluded. Meanwhile, a main feature of the smartphone is the operation of internet-based applications; thus, smartphone use must share many functional or psychological properties with internet use. Therefore, based on the possible relationship, investigating smartphone addiction in relation to internet addiction by integrative study would be reasonable.",

A recent study by the Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in 2013 reported that of the 1.63 million Korean adolescents, 17.9% comprised those with smartphone addiction. 43 Moreover, over 24% of children diagnosed with internet addiction are hospitalized. 44 A very similar trend is found in Japan. A study by the Japanese Ministry of Education has led to the recognition of the necessity for a government-managed system. 45 Likewise, some specialized treatment centers and care-giving programs have been established in Europe (the outpatient clinic for behavior addictions in Mainz, Germany, and the Capio Nightingale Hospital in London, UK) and the USA (the inpatient centers RESTART internet addiction recovery program in Seattle, and digital detoxification and recovery center in Pennsylvania, USA). 46 It implies that internet and smartphone addiction presents a significant global challenge.",

However, conflicting results regarding differences between the sexes in internet use have also been reported. [52][53][54] According to previous studies, male-female differences in internet addiction are due to differences in usage patterns, motivations, or purposes. For example, social use is significantly more important for females than it is for males, and leisure or interest-oriented use is more salient for males than it is for females. 47,[54][55][56] Although the literature has not reached a clear agreement, the findings of this study suggest that sex may influence examinations of the relationship between internet and smartphone addictions.",

The pattern of addiction severity and related problems for the latent classes of both sexes was characterized by increasing severity from LC1 to LC3. This result is very comparable to a project study performed by the Korean National Information Society Agency in 2011. The study found that both adult and adolescent smartphone users could be divided into three different groups based on addiction proneness levels. Among adolescents, 2.2% identified as belonging to the high-risk group, and 9.3% were in the low-medium-risk group. In adults, 1% of the users were in the high-risk group, and 6.7% were in the low-medium risk group. 57 Furthermore, multiple cross-comparison results revealed a trend that was common to both sexes: anxiety levels and neurotic personality traits increased with addiction severity levels. However, the scores on the Lie dimension of the EPQ, which is an indication of social desirability level, were inversely related to the severity levels of the latent classes. For the females only, more severely addicted people exhibited more psychotic personality traits in the EPQ.",

A study on internet addiction among Chinese adolescents reported that the internet-addicted group scored higher in the neuroticism and psychoticism dimensions and lower in the Lie dimension than the control group. 58 Similarly, internet addiction has been found to strongly positively correlate with neuroticism and negatively correlate with social desirability (Lie). 59 Additionally, a study demonstrated that typical internet addicts exhibit anxiousness and problems with social contact. 60 These findings are corroborated by the results of our study. It is well known that the neuroticism dimension encompasses moodiness and vulnerability to emotional stimuli, 61 and these traits are similar to those of anxiety. Therefore, the observed positive relationships of neuroticism and anxiety with addiction severity are relevant. Furthermore, psychoticism is strongly associated with aggressiveness, socially unacceptable behavior, [62][63][64] sensation-seeking, 65 and low impulse control. 66 As mentioned previously, the core features of behavioral addiction include the following: 1) continued engagement in a behavior despite adverse consequences; 2) diminished control over participation in the behavior; 3) compulsive participation; and 4) craving or appetitive urges that immediately precede engagement in the behavior. 67,68 Therefore, the pattern of psychoticism observed in the female participants can be interpreted with the sensation-seeking behavior and impaired abilities to control smartphone usage. Eysenck and Eysenck 37 reported that people who score high on the Lie scale tend to score low on psychoticism and extraversion. A negative relationship between the Lie dimension and sensation-seeking has also been reported. 65 Furthermore, Montag et al 59 found a significant negative correlation between internet addiction and the Lie dimension.",

Because Cao and Su 58 interpreted the Lie dimension as being beneficial for behavioral development, the Lie personality category can be identified as a category of social desirability or social conformity. Hence, it can be assumed that the LC1 participants of both sexes had the greatest desires to be socially desirable and exhibited the least unstable and impulsive traits. Consequently, we suggest that, for the people in LC1, the beneficial influence of the social desirability trait might have suppressed the other problematic traits related to internet and smartphone addiction. Because internet and smartphone problems were inversely related to social desirability traits, this supposition may be relevant for explaining the differences among classes.",

Little research has cast light on these issues, despite the increasing negative influence of these addictions on our lives. Therefore, the present study, which sought to explore the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction and related psychosocial problems, would be worthy of notice. We identified three latent classes based on addiction severity and confirmed the distinctive traits of these classes. The present results are expected to contribute to expanding the behavioral addiction field and to facilitate further research into its clinical implications.",
