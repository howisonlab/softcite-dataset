            "text": "Frontoparietal white matter supports information transfer between brain areas involved in complex haptic tasks such as somatosensory discrimination. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the relationship between microstructural integrity of frontoparietal network white matter and haptic performance in persons with chronic stroke and to compare frontoparietal network integrity in participants with stroke and age matched control participants. Nineteen individuals with stroke and 16 controls participated. Haptic performance was quantified using the Hand Active Sensation Test (HASTe), an 18-item match-to-sample test of weight and texture discrimination. Three tesla MRI was used to obtain diffusion-weighted and high-resolution anatomical images of the whole brain. Probabilistic tractography was used to define 10 frontoparietal tracts total; Four intrahemispheric tracts measured bilaterally 1) thalamus to primary somatosensory cortex (T-S1), 2) thalamus to primary motor cortex (T-M1), 3) primary to secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 to SII) and 4) primary somatosensory cortex to middle frontal gyrus (S1 to MFG) and, 2 interhemispheric tracts; S1-S1 and precuneus interhemispheric. A control tract outside the network, the cuneus interhemispheric tract, was also examined. The diffusion metrics fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for each tract. Diminished FA and elevated MD values are associated with poorer white matter integrity in chronic stroke. Nine of 10 tracts quantified in the frontoparietal network had diminished structural integrity poststroke compared to the controls. The precuneus interhemispheric tract was not significantly different between groups. Principle component analysis across all frontoparietal white matter tract MD values indicated a single factor explained 47% and 57% of the variance in tract mean diffusivity in stroke and control groups respectively. Age strongly correlated with the shared variance across tracts in the control, but not in the poststroke participants. A moderate to good relationship was found between ipsilesional T-M1 MD and affected hand HASTe score (r = \u22120.62, p = 0.006) and less affected hand HASTe score (r = \u22120.53, p = 0.022). Regression analysis revealed approximately 90% of the variance in affected hand HASTe score was predicted by the white matter integrity in the frontoparietal network (as indexed by MD) in poststroke participants while 87% of the variance in HASTe score was predicted in control participants. This study demonstrates the importance of frontoparietal white matter in mediating haptic performance and specifically identifies that T-M1 and precuneus interhemispheric tracts may be appropriate targets for piloting rehabilitation interventions, such as noninvasive brain stimulation, when the goal is to improve poststroke haptic performance.",

            "text": "Active sensation or haptic touch is the ability to use movement of the hand and arm to solicit somatosensory information from the environment (Lederman and Klatzky, 1997). Haptic impairment is a common result of stroke identified in 31-89% of cases (Kim and Choi-Kwon, 1996;Gaubert and Mockett, 2000;Connell et al., 2008;Carey and Matyas, 2011;Borstad et al., 2012a). The functional consequence of haptic impairment can be conceptualized in two ways. First, there is the loss of the hand's natural role as the primary somatosensory receptor of the environment (Lederman and Klatzky, 1998). Second, there is reduced somatosensory afferent information that is particularly important for dexterous movements (Classen et al., 2000). Hence, haptics and manual dexterity are co-dependent aspects of sensorimotor performance.",

            "text": "Stroke mainly affects subcortical structures and white matter (Corbetta et al., 2015). Several studies in stroke describe the relationship between white matter integrity and poststroke motor performance; however, the extent to which the integrity of white matter within the frontoparietal network is related to haptic performance is largely unknown. Constituent regions of the frontoparietal network associated with haptic performance have been identified using functional MRI; they are widely distributed and include primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, the premotor cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and the cerebellum (Stoeckel et al., 2003;Harada et al., 2004;Borstad et al., 2012a;Van de Winckel et al., 2005. Efficient information processing between brain areas is requisite to function and dependent upon the integrity of their white matter connections (Seidl, 2014). Because stroke results in diminished integrity both local to and distant from the lesion (Crofts et al., 2011;Borich et al., 2012;Auriat et al., 2015;Lindberg et al., 2007Lindberg et al., , 2011Yin et al., 2013;Lim et al., 2012;Carter et al., 2012), diminished integrity in the distributed network that supports somatosensation may explain, in part, why somatosensation was found to be impaired in both the affected and less affected upper extremity after stroke (Borstad et al., 2012a;Kim and Choi-Kwon, 1996;Connell et al., 2008;Carey and Matyas, 2011). Parts of the frontoparietal network have been examined in chronic stroke for their relationship to sensorimotor performance. In a previous study we found that integrity of the sensory aspect of the superior thalamic radiation, which includes all afferent connections to S1 (Wakana et al., 2004), was related to haptic performance (Borstad et al., 2012a). Buch and colleagues showed the structural connectivity in the superior longitudinal fascicles II and III between frontal and parietal regions were associated with better sensorimotor rhythm modulation skill in severe chronic hemiparesis (Buch et al., 2012). Borich and colleagues reported integrity of the sensory region of the CC was reduced following chronic stroke but was not correlated with manual dexterity as measured by the Box and Blocks Test. A somatosensory measure was not included in their assessment (Borich et al., 2012).",

The two most frequently used diffusion metrics are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) (Vos et al., 2012). FA quantifies the degree of directional dependence of diffusion while MD reflects the overall amount of isotropic diffusion. The diffusion signal can be further reduced to individual components that include: axial diffusivity (AD) largest eigenvalue, presumed to be along the length of the axons and radial diffusivity (RD) refers to the average of the next two smaller eigenvalues, which are presumed to be perpendicular to the axon. Elevated MD and diminished FA are associated with poorer white matter microstructural integrity in chronic stroke (Schlaug et al., 1997).",

We also examined the extent to which frontoparietal network microstructural integrity related to haptic performance as measured by the Hand Active Sensation Test (HASTe) (Borstad et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2006). The goals were to 1) identify frontoparietal network tracts in which poststroke participants had diminished integrity compared to controls and 2) determine if the microstructural integrity of frontoparietal tracts was related to haptic performance. We hypothesized that there would be significant differences between poststroke and control participants in frontoparietal tract integrity and that diminished tract integrity would correlate with haptic performance of the stroke affected upper extremity.",

To complete the test, for each trial, participants manually explore one test object and three sample objects that vary by weight or texture without using vision. Participants are asked to indicate which sample object is a match to the test object without discussing the properties of the objects. The accuracy score out of 18 is recorded for each hand; 13 or greater out of 18 possible has been considered the cut off for normal performance (Williams et al., 2006). Because of the match-to-sample design 6/18 could be considered a chance score. HASTe scores for control and poststroke participants were normally distributed and are reported in Table 1. The 6-item Wolf Motor function Test was used to quantify motor performance (Bogard et al., 2009). The 6 items included: hand to table (front), hand to box (front), reach and retrieve, lift can, lift pencil, and fold towel. Pre-stroke handedness was determined using the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Clinical evaluation and MRI took place on the same day for each participant.

Diffusion tensor image analysis was performed using FMRIB Diffusion Toolbox (FDT) included in Functional MRI of the Brain Software Library (FSL) (Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) (Smith et al., 2004). Image artifacts due to eddy currents and bulk head motion were minimized including b-matrix rotation during motion correction (Smith et al., 2004). Non-brain tissue was removed (Smith et al., 2002). Scalar maps for mean tract FA, MD, AD and RD were generated. Because the component diffusion metrics may provide more specific information about the underling tissue properties they were included in our analysis (Budde et al., 2007;Song et al., 2003). For poststroke participants, high-resolution anatomical images were masked to null voxels in the region of their lesion to minimize lesion related structural changes from affecting the registration. Affine (12 degrees-of-freedom) registration was used to obtain transformation matrices first between the diffusion and anatomical space and then between the anatomical and standard space (Montreal Neurologic 12.6/12.5 1432 T-test p = 0.45 p = 0.11/p = 0.01 p = 0.33 NA, not applicable; Dom., dominant, R, right; L, left; NT, not tested; t-test, two-tailed t-test; HASTe, Hand Active Sensation Test; the majority of participants were right hand so HASTe scores from the less affected upper extremity of the poststroke participants were compared to the right hand of the control participants, scores from the more affected upper extremity were compared to the left hand of control participants.",

The intrahemispheric tracts measured in both hemispheres were thalamus to primary somatosensory cortex (S1), thalamus to primary motor cortex (M1), S1 to middle frontal gyrus (MFG), S1 to secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Previously the T-S1 tract was related to poststroke haptic performance, it includes all sensory afferents to the S1 cortex (Borstad et al., 2012a). Thalamus to M1 includes efferent pathways from the frontoparietal network. These 10 tracts were successfully modeled with probabilistic tractography using a two-ROI approach (Heiervang et al., 2006). A minimum FA threshold of 0.2 was used to constrain probabilistic tracking. Our attempt to model a tract between left S1 and right SII (and right S1 and left SII) was unsuccessful in a series of 5 control subjects so was discontinued. We hypothesize this was due to the accumulation of uncertainty in the probabilistic algorithm caused by distance and curves in the tracts (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011). To establish that the adjacent thalamocortical tracts studied here were independent (set a priori at b 10% overlap), the extent of overlap was calculated in each participant. The mean amount of overlap in voxels in stroke and control participants was 7.76% and 7.88% respectively. To provide a basis for comparison to frontoparietal network tracts studied here we also quantified the interhemispheric tract between right and left cuneus cortices. Circulation for the cuneus cortex comes from the posterior cerebral artery. As no participants in this study had posterior cerebral artery distribution stroke this tract was selected for controlcomparison purposes. Standard space masks used for probabilistic tracking met reproducible criteria (and are detailed in Supporting Information-end of this document). The position of tracts of interest was confirmed visually in each participant. As indices of tract integrity, mean tract FA, MD, AD and RD were then calculated. All voxels through which a probabilistic streamline passed were used to calculate means.",

While the HASTe was sensitive to between group differences in this study, it did not perform as reported by Williams and colleagues in that some control participants (50% with the left and 56% with the right hand) studied here scored lower than the suggested cut off of 13/18 correct matches for normal performance. This cut off was suggested based on the fact that in their control sample (n = 28, mean age 60 (14) years) no participants scored less than 13/18. The mean/range in age of their participants was similar to ours so this difference seems unlikely to be related to age. A possible cause for the difference is control participant scores is that a different HASTe kit was used for this study. The HASTe is not commercially produced; therefore subtle differences in construction of the test objects could affect scores. Important to the interpretation of the current studies data is that the same test kit, tester and method of administration was used across both participant groups.  Fig. 3. Thalamocortical white matter mean diffusivity related to haptic performance. One white matter tract in the ipsilesional hemisphere, the thalamus to M1 cortex, had a significant relationship with haptic performance of the affected hand across the poststroke participants (r = 0.62, p = 0.006). The same tract also had the strongest relationship with less affected hand haptic performance (r = 0.53, p = 0.022).",

Only the precuneus interhemispheric tract was not significantly different between groups. The cuneus interhemispheric tract, chosen as a control tract, was also not statistically different between groups for FA or MD, though it was different for AD. These results are consistent with and extend findings from other diffusion imaging studies that have shown that poststroke microstructure is diminished in ipsilesional and contralesional CST (Schaechter et al., 2009), in areas surrounding the lesions and homologous locations in the contralesional hemisphere (Crofts et al., 2011). By quantifying stroke-control variations in white matter integrity the science is progressing toward an understanding of the biological processes, which follow stroke and are associated with recovery (Johansen-Berg and Behrens, 2009). Mechanisms associated with increases in diffusivity local to the lesion include axonal degeneration and gliosis (Pierpaoli et al., 1996;Werring et al., 2000); less frequently reported contralesional hemisphere changes have been referred to as transhemispheric diaschisis (Andrews, 1991).",

In our control data, age was strongly correlated with the shared variance in white matter integrity across frontoparietal tracts (r = 0.95, p b 0.0001). Conversely, the shared variance in white matter integrity between tracts in our stroke participants did not correlate with age (r = 0.20, p = 0.42). We believe this is because disruptions to white matter integrity due to stroke supersede those due to aging. This is supported by trends in our data between shared variance for the poststroke participants and chronicity (r = 0.42, p = 0.07) and lesion volume (r = 0.41, p = 0.07). Taken together, diminished integrity in both ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, and the large shared variance across the network in stroke participants, which is not correlated with age, suggest that there is a general strokerelated factor affecting the frontoparietal network white matter integrity. This finding has important implications for interpreting quantitative white matter studies in stroke. First, reporting diffusion metrics as a proportion of the same structure in the contralesional hemisphere may be biased by contralesional microstructural changes. Second, in light of network wide changes, single tract studies are at risk of over simplifying the relationship between white matter structure and behavior.",

In the poststroke participants a good relationship between ipsilesional thalamus-M1 integrity and haptic performance was identified. When thinking about the axons that travel between thalamus and M1 cortex it is tempting to assume the data reflect primarily efferent pathways. Of course, an important limitation of probabilistic tractography is the inability to distinguish between afferent and efferent tracts. One possible mechanism by which thalamus-M1 white matter integrity may support haptic performance is through facillatory drive to M1 from the dentate nucleus via the dentato-thalamo-cortical pathway. The dentate nucleus puts forth facilitation into the contralateral M1 through synaptic relay in the ventral lateral thalamus (Middleton and Strick, 2000;Dum et al., 2002); Ramnani, 2006). A second possible mechanism by which thalamus-M1 white matter may support haptic performance is through afferent input directly to M1. Some experiments have shown that the M1 hand area receives input from peripheral receptors (Friedman and Jones, 1981;Darian-Smith and Darian-Smith, 1993). There is still a question whether M1 receives direct afferents or only input through S1 (Reis et al., 2008).",

When the M1-peduncular tract, which includes the CST, is generated with diffusion tractography, at the level of the internal capsule, it is located in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) between the posterior putamen and the thalamus (Newton et al.,   2006). Therefore, the CST is closely adjacent to the thalamus-M1 tract quantified here; it is possible there was overlap. Because haptic performance measured by the HASTe is a somatosensory task, which is in part dependent upon motor manipulation, we wished to discern whether the positive relationship between thalamus-M1 integrity and HASTe score was a function of better motor performance. In post-hoc analyses we found no relationship between motor performance, measured by the 6-item Wolf and thalamus-M1 integrity. Nor was there a relationship between 6-item Wolf scores and haptic performance. These findings support the idea of a unique role of thalamus-M1 integrity to haptic performance in chronic stroke.",

Pellijeff and colleagues found precuneus activation related to the updating of limb posture (Pellijeff et al., 2006). When transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to inhibit the precuneus, impaired performance on grating orientation, a measure of tactile spatial acuity resulted (Zangaladze et al., 1999).

Age was not a predictor in either model. The strongest predictor in both poststroke and control models was the precuneus interhemispheric tract. This finding is aligned with data from a previous study in which we found precuneus cortex fMRI activation correlated with HASTe scores in individuals with chronic left hemisphere stroke (Borstad et al., 2012b). Precuneus functional MRI activation has also been associated with length but not shape discrimination in a study of individuals with chronic left hemisphere subcortical stroke (Van de Winckel et al., 2012). In the broad context of the relationship between poststroke white matter integrity and sensory-motor behavior, this studies findings parallel a recent large study of acute stroke in which a large percentage of sensory-motor deficit was explained by white matter damage (Corbetta et al., 2015) and exemplify the idea that neurologic disorders are due to problems of network function (Stam, 2014).",

            "text": "A few limitations should be considered when interpreting this data. We used 32 diffusion-weighting gradient directions diffusion data, which may not be as robust to issues of complex intra-voxel fiber architecture and partial volume effects as acquisitions with a greater number of gradient directions or tensor-free approaches. It is possible that the high variability in FA found in our S1-SII tract is related to the tracts' smaller, peripheral, and more acute path (Heiervang et al., 2006), therefore we feel care should be taken in interpretation of S1-SII diffusion parameter values. The dense intra-cortical connections between S1 and M1 are known to be important to sensorimotor processes (see recent review by Borich) (Borich et al., 2015), however, they were not quantified in this study because accurate tracking in the network of horizontal intra-cortical white matter is a limitation of probabilistic tractography (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011). They should be included in future efforts to quantify this network. Regardless of our efforts to check the position of each tract of interest in each participant, subtle misregistration between participant data and the standard space masks may have resulted in small differences in tracts generated and the diffusion metrics derived. By having an age matched control group and applying the same rigorous registration and analysis process across groups we attempted to mitigate this effect. Diffusion metrics may have been underestimated in poststroke participants as a minimum FA threshold of 0.2 was used to constrain probabilistic tracking. We chose conservative thresholding to reduce sensitivity to noise and partial volume effects making false positives less likely (Behrens et al., 2003). However, this may have resulted in smaller samples in degraded tracts (Johansen-Berg and Behrens, 2009). In spite of this we identified many differences in tract integrity between poststroke and control participants and statistically significant and plausible relationships with behavior, which lend support to our approach. The poststroke participants in this study had heterogeneous lesion locations. While lesions were masked to avoid contribution to registration error, the lack of strict anatomical criteria for lesions of the participants included here likely contributed to variability, decreasing the sensitivity of this study, however, variable lesion size and location is reflective of the clinical population with stroke and likely improves generalizability of our findings.",
