Here we report two ZIKV replicon systems: a luciferase replicon that can differentiate between viral translation and RNA synthesis; and a stable luciferase replicon carrying cell line that can be used to screen and characterize inhibitors of viral replication. The transient replicon was used to evaluate the effect of an NS5 polymerase mutation on viral RNA synthesis and to analyze a known ZIKV inhibitor. The replicon cell line was developed into a 96-well format for antiviral testing. Compare with virus infection-based assay, the replicon cell line allows antiviral screening without using infectious virus. Collectively, the replicon systems have provided critical tools for both basic and translational research.",

Many flaviviruses, such as the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), cause significant human diseases. The current epidemic of ZIKV in the Americas poses an international public health emergency. Symptomatic ZIKV infection presents with \"dengue-like\" manifestations, such as fever, headaches, lethargy, conjunctivitis, rash, arthralgia, and myalgia. Severe diseases associated with ZIKV infection include neurotropic Guillain-Barre syndrome and congenital microcephaly (Shan et al., 2016a). Despite urgent medical needs, neither vaccine nor therapeutics are currently available for ZIKV.",

It is equally urgent to establish tools for vaccine and antiviral development. Flavivirus replicon is a self-replicative viral RNA. Compare with the complete viral genome, the replicon contains a deletion of viral structural gene(s) (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997). The replicon can be launched through transfection of susceptible cells with in vitro transcribed RNA, or introduced from plasmids that encode the replicon cDNA under a CMV or SV40 promoter. Flavivirus replicon can also be stably expressed in cells when a selection marker (such as Neomycin resistance gene [Neo]) is engineered into the system. Such replicon systems have been established for WNV (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997;Lo et al., 2003a;Shi et al., 2002), YFV (Corver et al., 2003;Jones et al., 2005), DENV (Ng et al., 2007;Puig-Basagoiti et al., 2006), TBEV (Gehrke et al., 2003), and JEV (Li et al., 2013). They have been successfully used to study viral translation/replication (Manzano et al., 2011;Wang et al., 2011), to produce single-round infectious particles as vaccine candidate (Harvey et al., 2004;Qing et al., 2010), and to screen compound libraries for antiviral inhibitors (Lo et al., 2003b;Xie et al., 2011).",

Standard overlap PCR was performed to amplify the DNA fragment between unique restriction enzyme sites NotI and SphI. This DNA fragment contains the T7 promoter, 5\u2032UTR, and a DNA cassette (C 38 -Rluc2A-E 30 ) in-frame fused with the ORF (Fig. 1). The C 38 -Rluc2A-E 30 cassette encodes the N-terminal 38 amino acids of C protein (C 38 ), Rluc reporter, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A protease, and the C-terminal 30 amino acids of the E protein (E 30 ). The codons of C 38 contain the flavivirus-conserved cyclization sequence required for viral RNA replication (Hahn et al., 1987;Khromykh et al., 2001). The E 30 serves as a signal peptide for proper translocation of NS1 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. The purified PCR fragment was cloned into pFLZIKV through the NotI and SphI sites to replace the structural genes, resulting in plasmid pZIKV Rep WT (wild-type). As a control, the flavivirus-conserved polymerase motif GDD (corresponding to residues Gly664, Asp665, and Asp666 in ZIKV polyprotein) was mutated to Ala (G664A-D665A-D66A) using QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies), resulting in plasmid Rep NS5\u0394GDD.",

The IRES-Neo cassette (containing a neomycin phosphotransferase [Neo] gene driven by an internal ribosomal entry site [IRES] from encephalomyocarditis virus) was inserted downstream of the first 28 nucleotides of 3\u2032UTR. The IRES-Neo cassette was amplified by PCR using WNV Rluc/ NeoRep as a template (Lo et al., 2003b). Overlap PCR was performed to fuse the IRES-Neo cassette with the 3\u2032UTR, resulting in a DNA fragment spanning restriction enzyme sites EcoRI and ClaI. This fragment was cloned into pZIKV Rep WT through the EcoRI and ClaI sites, resulting in plasmid Rep-Neo. All plasmids were validated by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The complete DNA sequences of plasmids pZIKV Rep WT and Rep-Neo are shown in Supplemental Materials. Primer sequences are available upon request. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs.",

At incubating the cells at 37\u00b0C for 16 h, medium was replaced with fresh phenol red-free medium containing 2% FBS. The reason for using 2% FBS phenol red-free medium (rather than 10% FBS medium) is to minimize protein binding of compounds. Compounds NITD-008 (a gift from Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases) with 10-fold serial dilutions were added to cells. Cells were also treated with 0.9% DMSO as a negative control. After 48 h of treatment at 37\u00b0C, cells were assayed for Rluc activity using ViviRen substrates (Promega) or cell viability using Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Sigma) as previously described (Xie et al., 2011). The 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) and 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) were estimated by using a four-parameter logistic regression model from the GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego CA). For the antiviral screening assay, we chose ViviRen substrate, rather than Renilla lysis buffer/substrate (as described for transient replicon assay), to improve the assay throughput. This is because ViviRen substrate is able to penetrate into cells, thus eliminating the step of cell lysis during antiviral screening. Fig. 1a depicts the ZIKV replicon containing a Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene (pZIKV Rep WT). The pZIKV Rep WT was constructed by replacing the viral structural genes with Rluc using a full-length cDNA infectious clone (pFLZIKV) (Shan et al., 2016b). As a control, Rep-NS5\u0394GDD was constructed by mutating the viral polymerase GDD active site to Ala (G664A-D665A-D66A in ZIKV; Fig. 1a). A T7 promoter and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDVr) sequence were engineered at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the replicon cDNA for in vitro transcription and for generation of the authentic 3\u2032 end of the RNA transcript, respectively. Upon transfection into Huh7 cells, wild-type (WT) replicon RNA generated two distinct Rluc peaks (Fig. 1b). The first peak appeared at 2 h post-transfection (p.t.) and decreased from 4 to 8 h. At 24 h p.t., the Rluc signal increased by 200 folds above that of 2 h post-transfection. At 32 h p.t., the Rluc signal reached the second peak. Mutation of the viral polymerase GDD motif (Rep-NS5\u0394GDD) abolished the second Rluc peak, but did not affect the first Rluc peak. Collectively, the results indicate that the first and second Rluc peaks represent the translation of the input RNA and the translation of the newly synthesized RNA, respectively. These results are in agreement with the previously reported flavivirus replicons (Lo et al., 2003a).",

This compound was recently shown to inhibit ZIKV in cell culture and A129 mice (Deng et al., 2016;Shan et al., 2016b). We treated the replicon-transfected cells with NITD-008 (1 or 5 \u03bcM in medium containing 0.9% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] because the compound was initially dissolved in 100% DMSO). Fig. 1c shows the Rluc signals collected up to 32 h p.t.; data points after 32 h were not presented because the Rluc signals dramatically decreased. No significant differences in Rluc signal were observed from 2 to 8 h p.t. between the NITD-008-treated cells and DMSO control, indicating that NITD-008 does not affect viral RNA translation. In contrast, at 24 and 32 h p.t., the Rluc signals were markedly suppressed by NITD-008 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c), indicating that the compound inhibits viral RNA synthesis. Notably, NITD-008 suppressed Rluc signals less efficiently at 32 h than that at 24 h in the transfected cells, possibly due to the difference in conversions of NITD-008 to its triphosphate (the active antiviral form) at different time points. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the utility of the replicon in analyzing the mode-of-action of antiviral compounds. Fig. 2a shows the second ZIKV replicon containing Rluc and Neo genes (Rep-Neo). The dual reporter replicon was constructed by inserting an EMCV IRES (encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site)-Neo into the 3\u2032UTR of the above Rluc replicon. The Rep-Neo RNA were transfected into Huh7 cells; the transfected cells were selected under Geneticin (G418). Fig. 2b depicts the selection flowchart for the Rep-Neo cells. For evaluating the replication competency of Rep-Neo RNA, 1 \u00d7 10 5 transfected cells/well were seeded into a 24-well plate. At 24 and 48 h p.t., the cells were assayed for Rluc activity; the Rep-Neo RNA-transfected cells produced N 1 \u00d7 10 3 -fold higher luciferase signals than na\u00efve Huh7 cells; almost background levels of Rluc activities were detected in the cells transfected with an NS5 polymerase GDD active site mutant RNA (NS5\u0394GDD Rep) (Fig. 2c). The results demonstrate that Rep-Neo RNA is replication-competent.",

Next, we examined the P6 Rep-Neo cells for viral RNA, protein expression, and luciferase signals. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-double strand RNA (dsRNA) or anti-NS4B mAb showed viral dsRNA and NS4B protein in all Rep-Neo cells; in contrast, neither dsRNA nor NS4B signals were detected in na\u00efve Huh7 cells ( Fig. 2d & e).

As shown in Fig. 2g, NITD-008 reduced Rluc signal in a dose-dependent manner with a calculated 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 0.8 \u03bcM; no obvious cytotoxicity was observed at the highest tested concentration of 25 \u03bcM. The EC 50 value in Huh7 was more potent than the EC 50 values previously reported in Vero cells (3.6 and 2.5 \u03bcM derived from plaque assay and a luciferase virus infection assay, respectively) (Shan et al., 2016b); this is most likely because the kinases that convert NITD-008 to its triphosphate form are more robust in Huh7 cells than those in Vero cells (Deng et al., 2016). Overall, the data are consistent with the known antiviral activity of NITD-008 against DENV and ZIKV (Shan et al., 2016b;Yin et al., 2009), demonstrating that the ZIKV Rep-Neo cell line could be used for compound library screening.",

            "text": "Replicon-based cell lines have been widely used for flaviviruses, including DENV (Ng et al., 2007), WNV (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997;Lo et al., 2003b), and hepatitis C virus (Blight et al., 2000). The two genes (Rluc and Neo) engineered into the current replicon constructs could be replaced by other reporter (such as NanoLuc, GFP, or mCherry) and selection marker (such as puromycin N-acetyl-transferase [PAC]). The ZIKV Rep-Neo cells could be readily adapted for highthroughput screening in a 384-and 1536-well format (Xie et al., 2011). Because replicon assay does not generate infectious particles, it eliminates the risk of laboratory-acquired viral infection. Since the replicon assay examines cell permeability of compounds, inhibitors identified through such assay (in comparison with viral enzyme-based screening assays) might have a high success rate during preclinical development (Shi, 2002). Although the replicon-based assay covers all targets involved in viral translation and RNA synthesis, it does not include targets required for viral entry and virion assembly/release. Those targets could be covered by using a replicon-derived virus-like particle (VLP)-based assay (Qing et al., 2010). VLPs can be produced through packaging the replicon RNA by structural proteins supplied in trans (Harvey et al., 2004;Qing et al., 2010). Besides drug discovery, the VLPs could also be used for potential vaccine development.",

The flowchart outlines the major steps to generate the stable replicon carrying cell line. (c) Transient luciferase assay. Huh7 cells were electroporated with equal amounts (10 \u03bcg) of WT Rep-Neo RNA or an NS5 polymerase GDD active site mutant replicon (Rep NS5\u0394GDD) RNA. At 24 and 48 h p.t., luciferase signals were measured from lysates of about 20,000 transfected cells or na\u00efve Huh7 cells. The average and standard deviations from three independent measurements are presented. (d) Detection of viral dsRNA. Rep-Neo cells (P6) were analyzed for dsRNA by IFA using mAb J2 and goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Nucleus was stained by DAPI. (e) Detection of viral NS4B protein. The expression of NS4B protein was detected in Rep-Neo cells (P6) using mAb 44-4-7 and goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor\u00ae488 as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. (f) Luciferase assay of P6 Rep-Neo cells. Luciferase activities were measured from the lysates of 20,000 P6 Rep-Neo cells or naive Huh7 cells. (g) Antiviral testing using Rep-Neo cells. Rep-Neo cells (P6) were seeded into a 96-well plate. The cells were incubated with NITD-008 at indicated concentrations and measured for luciferase activities at 48 h post-treatment.
