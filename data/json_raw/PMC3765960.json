Subsets of MB neurons have temporally unique roles in memory processing, but valence-related organization has not been demonstrated. We functionally subdivided the ab neurons, revealing a value-specific role for the 160 ab core (ab c) neurons. Blocking neurotransmission from ab surface (ab s) neurons revealed a requirement during retrieval of aversive and appetitive memory, whereas blocking ab c only impaired appetitive memory. The ab c were also required to express memory in a differential aversive paradigm demonstrating a role in relative valuation and approach behavior. Strikingly, both reinforcing dopamine neurons and efferent pathways differentially innervate ab c and ab s in the MB lobes. We propose that conditioned approach requires pooling synaptic outputs from across the ab ensemble but only from the ab s for conditioned aversion.",

            "text": "Olfactory learning in Drosophila is ideally suited to address these questions. Conditioning flies with aversive electric shock or sugar reward assigns value to otherwise meaningless odors and alters naive odor preferences so that subsequent odordriven behavior becomes goal-directed movement (Tully and Quinn, 1985;Tempel et al., 1983). Trained flies either avoid or approach the previously conditioned odor, driven by the expectation of punishment or food, respectively. Although progress has been made toward delineating how specific odors are represented (Turner et al., 2008;Murthy et al., 2008;Honegger et al., 2011) and reinforcement signals conveyed (Claridge-Chang et al., 2009;Aso et al., 2010Aso et al., , 2012Liu et al., 2012;Burke et al., 2012), it is not known how opposing behavioral programs of avoidance or approach are generated.",

            "text": "Olfactory memories are believed to be represented within the 2,000 intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) of the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) (Heisenberg, 2003). Individual odors activate relatively sparse populations of KCs within the overall MB ensemble providing cellular specificity to odor memories (Turner et al., 2008;Murthy et al., 2008;Honegger et al., 2011). Prior research of fly memory suggests that the KCs can be functionally split into at least three major subdivisions: the ab, a 0 b 0 , and g neurons. The current consensus suggests a role for g in short-term memory, for a 0 b 0 after training for memory consolidation, and for ab in later memory retrieval, with the ab requirement becoming more pronounced as time passes (Zars et al., 2000;Yu et al., 2006;Krashes et al., 2007;Blum et al., 2009;Trannoy et al., 2011;Qin et al., 2012). Importantly, odor-evoked activity is observable in each of these cell types (Yu et al., 2006;Turner et al., 2008;Wang et al., 2008;Akalal et al., 2010;Honegger et al., 2011), consistent with a parallel representation of olfactory stimuli across the different KC classes.",

            "text": "Long before the zonal DA neuron innervation of the MB was fully appreciated, experiments suggested that appetitive and aversive memories were independently processed and stored (Tempel et al., 1983). Subsequently, models were proposed that represented memories of opposite valence at distinct output synapses on the same odor-activated KCs or on separate KCs (Schwaerzel et al., 2003). Importantly, memory retrieval through these modified KC-output synapses was predicted to guide either odor avoidance or approach behavior. A KC synapsespecific representation of memories of opposing valence would dictate that it is not possible to functionally separate the retrieval of aversive and appetitive memories by disrupting KC-wide processes. We therefore tested these models by systematically blocking neurotransmission from subsets of the retrieval-relevant ab neurons. We found that aversive and appetitive memories can be distinguished in the ab KC population, showing that opposing odor memories do not exclusively rely on overlapping KCs. Whereas output from the ab s neurons is required for aversive and appetitive memory retrieval, the ab core (ab c ) neurons are only critical for conditioned approach behavior. Higher-resolution anatomical analysis of the innervation of reinforcing DA neurons suggests that valencespecific asymmetry may be established during training. Furthermore, dendrites of KC-output neurons differentially innervate the MB in a similarly stratified manner. We therefore propose that aversive memories are retrieved and avoidance behavior triggered only from the ab surface (ab s ) neurons, whereas appetitive memories are retrieved and approach behavior is driven by efferent neurons that integrate across the ab ensemble.",

            "text": "Several studies have reported the importance of output from MB ab neurons for the retrieval of aversive and appetitive olfactory memories (Dubnau et al., 2001;McGuire et al., 2001;Schwaerzel et al., 2003;Krashes et al., 2007;Krashes and Waddell, 2008;Trannoy et al., 2011). However, genetic labeling reveals further anatomical segregation of the 1,000 ab neurons into at least ab posterior (ab p or pioneer), ab surface (ab s or early), and ab core (ab c or late) subsets that are sequentially born during development (Ito et al., 1997;Lin et al., 2007;Tanaka et al., 2008). We therefore investigated the role of these ab subsets in memory retrieval. We first obtained, or identified, GAL4 lines with expression that was restricted to ab subsets and verified their expression. Prior reports showed that the c739 GAL4 (McGuire et al., 2001) labels ab neurons contributing to all three classes (Aso et al., 2009). In contrast, NP7175 expresses in ab c neurons and c708a in ab p neurons (Murthy et al., 2008;Tanaka et al., 2008;Lin et al., 2007). Lastly, we identified the 0770 GAL4 line from the InSITE collection (Gohl et al., 2011) with strong expression in ab s neurons and weaker expression in ab p neurons. We expressed a membrane-tethered GFP (uas-mCD8::GFP) using the c739, 0770, NP7175, and c708a GAL4 drivers and localized expression within the overall MB neurons using a LexAop-rCD2::RFP transgene driven by 247-LexA::VP16 (Pitman et al., 2011). Projections of confocal stacks through the MBs revealed labeling within the MB in each of these GAL4 driver lines that is restricted to the respective ab subdivision ( Figure 1 and S1 available online). In addition, the ab s and ab c lines have dendrites in the main calyx, whereas ab p neurons innervate only the accessory calyx (Lin et al., 2007;Tanaka et al., 2008).",

In each experiment, we also compared the effect of blocking all MB ab neurons with c739. We first tested sucrose-reinforced appetitive memory (Krashes and Waddell, 2008).

Memory performance of c739;shi ts1 and 0770;shi ts1 , but not NP7175;shi ts1 or c708a;shi ts1 , flies was statistically different to that of shi ts1 and their respective GAL4 control flies ( Figure 2B). Importantly, control aversive experiments performed at 23 C did not reveal significant differences between the relevant groups ( Figure S2B). Therefore, these data reveal that output from the ab s neurons is required for the retrieval of aversive memory, whereas the ab c and ab p neurons are dispensable, implying a possible appetitive memory-specific role for ab c neurons. Since odors are represented as activation of sparse collections of MB neurons (Honegger et al., 2011), it is conceivable that certain odor pairs might be biased in their odor representations in particular ab subsets. The reciprocal nature of the conditioning assays should account for this caveat. Nevertheless, we also tested the effect of ab subset block when flies were appetitively or aversively trained using ethyl butyrate and isoamyl acetatetwo odors shown to activate ab c neurons (Murthy et al., 2008). These experiments again revealed a role for ab s and ab c in appetitive memory but only ab s in aversive memory ( Figures 2C  and 2D). The ab p neurons remained dispensable. The appetitive retrieval defect is unlikely to result from defective odor perception since flies with blocked ab c neurons (NP7175;shi ts1 ) exhibit normal aversive memory. Furthermore, control experiments demonstrated that c739;shi ts1 and 0770;shi ts1 exhibit normal olfactory acuity at the restrictive temperature (Table S1).",

We again trained flies at the permissive temperature and blocked ab c during retrieval. Similar to the analysis with NP7175;shi ts1 flies, appetitive memory performance of c739;ChaGAL80/shi ts1 flies was impaired, being statistically different to the relevant control groups ( Figure 3E).

Blocking NP6024-labeled ab c neurons for several hours after training disrupted appetitive and aversive memory consolidation, whereas blocking NP7175-labeled neurons only impaired aversive memory consolidation (Huang et al., 2012). Although others defined the ab neurons labeled in NP6024 as inner and outer ab c neurons (Tanaka et al., 2008; Flies were trained at the permissive 23 C and ab subsets blocked by shifting the flies to restrictive 33 C 30 min before and during testing 3 hr memory (schematic). (A) ab c and ab s neurons are required for retrieval of 3 hr appetitive memory. Blocking transmission from c739, 0770, and NP7175 neurons during testing impaired appetitive memory (all p < 0.001), whereas blocking c708a neurons had no effect (p = 0.10). (B) ab c neurons are not required for retrieval of aversive memory. Blocking transmission from c739 and 0770 neurons during testing impaired aversive memory (both p < 0.001), whereas blocking NP7175 or c708a neurons had no effect (p > 0.9 and p > 0.5). Odors used in (A) and (B) are 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH) and 3-octanol (OCT). (C and D) Repeat of experiments in (A) and (B) using isoamyl acetate (IAA) and ethyl butyrate (EB) as odors. The requirement for output from the ab s and ab c neurons for the retrieval of 3 hr appetitive memory was reproduced, whereas ab p neuron output remained dispensable. (C) Blocking transmission from c739, 0770, and NP7175 neurons during testing impaired appetitive memory (all p < 0.001), whereas blocking c708a neurons had no effect (p > 0.5). (D) Blocking transmission from c739 and 0770 neurons during testing impaired aversive memory (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001), whereas blocking NP7175 or c708a neurons had no effect (p > 0.4 and p > 0.2).

The wild-type group corresponds to pooled data from independent experiments and all data are represented as the mean \u00b1 SEM. See also Figures S1, S2, S4, and S7 and Table S1. Huang et al., 2012), our anatomical analysis revealed that outer ab c neurons occupy the area of the vertical MB lobe that is anatomically indistinguishable from that containing the ab s neurons ( Figures 3A-3D). Furthermore, blocking output during retrieval in NP6024;shi ts1 flies significantly impaired both appetitive and aversive memory ( Figures 3E and 3F), consistent with NP6024 expressing in ab c and ab s neurons. Control experiments at the permissive temperature did not reveal significant differ-ences between the relevant groups ( Figure S3) and the NP6024;shi ts1 flies exhibit normal olfactory acuity (Table S1). Perhaps more importantly, a consolidation effect cannot account for our appetitive memory retrieval-specific function because the retrieval role for ab c is not time dependent. As shown for 3 hr memory (Figures 2A and 2C), blocking NP7175 ab c neurons during retrieval also impaired appetitive 24 hr LTM ( Figure S4A), whereas it did not impair aversive 24 hr LTM (Huang ",

To rule out that the role of ab c neurons reflected a temporally restricted anatomical difference between appetitive versus aversive memory processing, we employed a differential aversive conditioning paradigm (Yin et al., 2009). In this assay, flies are trained by sequential exposure to one odor X without reinforcement (X 0 ), odor Y with a 60 V shock (Y 60 ), and then odor Z with 30 V (Z 30 ) ( Figure 5A). They are then tested 30 min after training for relative choice between Y 60 and Z 30 or absolute choice between X 0 and Y 60 . We speculated that retrieval of the relative choice memory between Y 60 and Z 30 odors might involve an approach component to odor Z 30 , similar to retrieval of appetitive memory.",

We expressed shi ts1 in a recently described subset of rewarding dopaminergic neurons with 0104-GAL4 (Burke et al., 2012) and blocked them during acquisition in the differential aversive paradigm (X 0 -Y 60 -Z 30 ). Flies were shifted to 33 C for 30 min prior to and during training and then returned to 23 C and tested for 30 min choice memory. Strikingly, performance of 0104/shi ts1 flies was statistically different to shi ts1 and 0104 control flies when tested for relative Y 60 versus Z 30 memory (Figure 5B) but was not different to controls when tested for absolute X 0 versus Y 60 memory ( Figure 5C). No differences were apparent between the relevant groups when flies were trained and tested at the permissive temperature for relative choice ( Figure 5D). Therefore, in this paradigm only, learning the odor presented with the relatively lesser voltage (Z 30 ) requires rewarding reinforcement. The Z 30 memory can therefore be considered to be appetitive.",

As expected, blocking NP7175;shi ts1 neuron output during retrieval of relative Y 60 versus Z 30 memory revealed a significant defect ( Figure 5E). No significant differences were apparent between the relevant groups at the permissive temperature ( Figure 5F). In contrast, ab c neuron block did not significantly impair expression of absolute X 0 and Y 60 choice memory ( Figure 5G). We also tested the role for ab c neurons using the c739;ChaGAL80 approach of manipulating these neurons. Like NP7175 neurons, blocking c739;Cha-GAL80 ab c neurons significantly disrupted retrieval of relative Y 60 versus Z 30 choice memory ( Figure 5E) but not absolute X 0 and Y 60 choice ( Figure 5G). Again, no significant differences were observed in control experiments at the permissive temperature ( Figure 5F). We also tested the requirement of ab s neurons in this paradigm. Consistent with previous experiments with aversive and appetitive reinforcement (Figure 2), blocking 0770 ab s neurons significantly disrupted retrieval of relative Y 60 versus Z 30 choice ( Figure 5E) and absolute X 0 and Y 60 choice memory ( Figure 5G). Again, no significant differences were observed in permissive temperature control experiments ( Figures 5F and  5H). We conclude from this diverse collection of appetitive memory experiments that the ab c neurons provide critical synaptic input for the expression of conditioned approach behavior.",

In contrast, most olfactory projection neurons in the fly innervate the MB calyx and lateral horn or only the lateral horn (Wong et al., 2002;Jefferis et al., 2007).

In this study, we investigated the functional correlates of substructure within the ab population. We identified an appetitive memory-specific role for the ab c neurons. Whereas blocking output from the ab s neurons impaired aversive and appetitive memory retrieval, blocking ab c neurons produced only an appetitive memory defect. These behavioral results, taken with functional imaging of odor-evoked activity, suggest that beyond the ab, a 0 b 0 , and g subdivision, odors are represented as separate streams in subsets of MB ab neurons. These parallel information streams within ab permit opposing value to be differentially assigned to the same odor. Training therefore tunes the odor-activated ab c and ab s KCs so that distinct populations differentially drive downstream circuits to generate aversive or appetitive behaviors. Such a dynamic interaction between appetitive and aversive circuits that is altered by learning is reminiscent of that described between the primate amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (Barberini et al., 2012). It will be important to determine the physiological consequences of appetitive and aversive conditioning on the ab c and ab s neurons. Positively and negatively reinforced olfactory learning in rats produced bidirectional plasticity of neurons in the basolateral amygdala (Motanis et al., 2012).",

In addition, we observed a pronounced role for ab c neurons in retrieval of 24 hr appetitive LTM, whereas others have reported that ab c neurons are not required for the retrieval of 24 hr aversive LTM (Huang et al., 2012). Nevertheless, time and the methods of conditioning may be important variables. Although appetitive and aversive memory retrieval requires output from the ab ensemble at 3 hr and 24 hr after conditioning (McGuire et al., 2001;Isabel et al., 2004;Krashes et al., 2007Krashes et al., , 2009Trannoy et al., 2011), ab neurons were shown to be dispensable for 2 hr appetitive memory retrieval (Trannoy et al., 2011). Instead, appetitive retrieval required g neuron output at this earlier point (Trannoy et al., 2011). Our experiments were generally supportive of the g-then-ab neuron model but revealed a slightly different temporal relationship. The ab neurons were dispensable for memory retrieved 30 min after training but were essential for 2 hr and 3 hr memory after training (Figures  2 and S7). An early role for g neurons is further supported by the importance of reinforcing DA input to the g neurons for aversive memory formation (Qin et al., 2012). It will be interesting to determine whether there is a stratified representation of valence within the g neuron population.",

Such a KC output synapse-specific organization dictates that it would not be possible to functionally segregate aversive and appetitive memory by blocking KC-wide output. We however found a specific role for the ab c neurons in conditioned approach that supports the alternative model of partially nonoverlapping KC representations of aversive and appetitive memories (Schwaerzel et al., 2003). The anatomy of the presynaptic terminals of reinforcing DA neurons in the MB lobes suggests that the functional asymmetry in ab could be established during training in which ab c only receive appetitive reinforcement. Rewarding DA neurons that innervate the b lobe tip ramify throughout the b s and b c , whereas aversive reinforcing DA neurons appear restricted to the ab s . Consistent with this organization of memory formation, aversive MB-V2a output neurons (S\u00e9 journ\u00e9 et al., 2011) have dendrites biased toward a s , whereas the dendrites of aversive (Pai et al., 2013) or appetitive (P.Y. Pla\u00e7 ais and T. Preat personal communication) MB-V3 output neurons are broadly distributed throughout the a lobe tip. We therefore propose a model that learned odor aversion is driven by ab s neurons, whereas learned approach comes from pooling inputs from the ab s and ab c neurons ( Figure 7).",

Prior work has shown that the dopaminergic MB-MP1 neurons are also critical for this level of control (Krashes et al., 2009). Since the MB-MP1 neurons more densely innervate the ab s than ab c , it would seem that satiety state differentially tunes the respective drive from parts of the ab ensemble to promote or inhibit appetitive memory retrieval.",

(2008), Burke et al. (2012), Chen et al. (2012), Kitamoto (2002), S\u00e9 journ\u00e9 et al. (2011), and Aso et al. (2012). The 0770, 0279, 0104, and 0006 flies, more correctly named PBac(IT.GAL4)0770, PBac(IT.GAL4)0279, PBac(IT.GAL4)0104, and PBac(IT.GAL4)0006, were generated and initially characterized by Marion Sillies and Daryl Gohl as part of the InSITE collection (Gohl et al., 2011). The 12-244 flies were obtained from Ulrike Heberlein. The MB-MP1 expressing c061:MBGAL80 is described in Krashes et al. (2009). We used flies carrying the uas-shi ts1 transgene (Kitamoto, 2001) on the third chromosome. We generated flies expressing shi ts1 in MB ab subsets, DA neurons, or DAL neurons by crossing uas-shi ts1 females to homozygous c739, 0770, c739;ChaGAL80, NP5286, 0104, 0006, or G0431 males. NP7175, c708a, and NP6024 reside on the X chromosome. Therefore, NP7175, NP6024, and c708a females were crossed to uas-shi ts1 males. Heterozygote uas-shi ts1 /+ controls were generated by crossing uas-shi ts1 females to wild-type males. Heterozygote GAL4/+ controls were generated by crossing GAL4 males to wild-type females. We generated flies expressing dTrpA1 in 0279 neurons by crossing uas-dTrpA1 females to homozygous 0279 males. Heterozygote uas-dTrpA1/+ controls were generated by crossing uas-dTrpA1/+ females to wild-type males. Heterozygote GAL4/+ controls were generated by crossing GAL4 males to wild-type females. GCaMP5G is described in Akerboom et al. (2012) and was subcloned into pUAST by David Owald. Transgenic flies were raised commercially (BestGene).",

DF/F traces were calculated in ImageJ using manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs) for the background and brain structure of interest. Activity maps were generated in MATLAB from Gaussian-smoothed, backgroundsubtracted images. A baseline fluorescence image was calculated as the average over a 10 s prestimulus interval. Minor z direction movement was ignored by correlating each frame to the baseline fluorescence and discarding it if the correlation fell below a threshold value. This threshold value was manually selected for each brain by noting the constant high correlation value when the brain was stationary and sudden drops in correlation when the brain moved. For each pixel, the difference between mean intensity during the stimulus and the mean baseline fluorescence (DF) was calculated. The DF during the presentation of a dummy stimulus (no odor) was subtracted to control for mechanical artifacts from the odor delivery system. If DF was less than two times the SD of the intensity of that pixel during the prestimulus interval, that pixel was considered unresponsive.",
