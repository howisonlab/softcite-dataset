Fifty-four (54) rats were studied. A circular bony defect (8 mm diameter) was formed in the centre of the calvaria using a trephine bur. The CFB-HAP membrane was prepared by thermally induced phase separation. In the experimental group (n518), the CFB-HAP membrane was used to cover the bony defect, and in the control group (n518), a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) was used. In the negative control group (n518), no membrane was used. In each group, six animals were euthanized at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. The specimens were then analysed using micro-CT. There were significant differences in bone volume (BV) and bone mineral density (BMD) (P,0.05) between the negative control group and the membrane groups. However, there were no significant differences between the CFB-HAP group and the collagen group. We concluded that the CFB-HAP membrane has significant potential as a guided bone regeneration (GBR) membrane.",

            "text": "Bone healing and regeneration is one of the most important processes in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is a well-established therapy that promotes new bone formation using a barrier membrane to guard the lesion from invasion of fibrous connective tissue. [1][2][3] As the barrier membrane prevents the down-growth of fibroblasts or epithelial cells that have fast proliferative capacities, only the in-growth of cells derived from bone marrow is permitted to the bony defects, with subsequent extracellular matrix deposition and bone mineralisation. 4 The properties required of a GBR barrier membrane are bioactivity (osteoinductivity), bioresorption, biocompatibility, a lack of cytotoxicity and space-maintaining ability, which is related to mechanical stability during the bone healing process. 1-3 A number of polymeric materials have been developed for GBR membranes, including non-degradable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene and degradable synthetic (polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid) or natural (such as collagen and chitosan) polymers. Thin expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membranes have been used as barriers that can be safely applied as biologically inert materials. However, a non-degradable membrane must be removed by a secondary operation including an incision. [5][6] Degradable polymers are favoured for their benefits of being totally degradable within the body and not requiring a secondary surgical procedure for removal; however, the mechanical strength of such membranes is typically low and is difficult to adjust. [6][7][8] Although bioresorbable collagen membranes have excellent cell affinity and biocompatibility, they have the problem of being potentially antigenic and moreover, carry a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmission. [9][10] Of the known natural biopolymers considered for biomedical applications, one greatly attractive material is chitosan, which is a polyheterosaccharide composed of glucosamine and N-acetyl glucosamine units linked by 1-4 glucosidic bonds. Much attention has been paid to chitosan-based biomedical materials, given their unique properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, antibacterial effects and biocompatibility. 1,11 Recently, silk fibroin has been considered for a wide variety of applications in biomedical materials ranging from skin and vascular grafts to substrates for mammalian cell cultures. Fibroin is a linear polypeptide that is composed of 17 amino acids and has a b-sheet structure because its main components are simple non-polar amino acids such as alanine and glycine. It has been reported that silk fibroin acts as an enzyme immobilisation matrix with good mechanical properties and has blood compatibility and good dissolved oxygen permeability in the wet state. 12 Hydroxyapatite is a major inorganic component of natural bone and, owing to its bioactive, biodegradable and osteoconductive properties, has been used extensively in biomedical implant and bone regeneration applications. It is also known to be biocompatible, nontoxic, non-inflammatory, and non-immunogenic, and it is capable of forming a direct chemical bond with surrounding hard tissues. 13 In a previous study, we fabricated a chitosan/fibroin-hydroxyapatite (CFB-HAP) composite membrane for bone regeneration because of the biocompatibility, resorbability, hemostasis, anti-infectivity, plasticity and adhesiveness 1 of this material. In the present study, we employed X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis to compare the new bone formation and healing properties of the CFB-HAP membrane to those of a collagen (Bio-Gide) membrane that is widely used as a barrier membrane in dental practice.",

The fibroin was obtained by dialysis from a calcium chloride solution of a degummed Bombyx mori silk. The HAP was synthesized to a Ca/P stoichiometric ratio of 1.55 and an ultimate average particle size of approximately 2 mm. Variations of the matrix properties, including chemical composition, pore morphology, microstructure, simulated body fluid absorptivity, protein permeability and tenacity were investigated. HAP incorporation improved the simulated body fluid absorptivity, protein permeability and mechanical strength of the composite while maintaining its high porosity and microstructure 1 (Figure 1).",

            "text": "Chitosan has unique properties such as non-toxicity, flexibility, antibacterial activity, solubility in organic acid solutions, biocompatibility and resistance to alkali environments and heat. [17][18] As chitosan is also one of the biodegradable polymers found in nature, it can be hydrolysed by lysozyme. Furthermore, chitosan has a hydrophilic surface that promotes cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, and unlike synthetic polymers, it evokes a minimal foreign-body reaction on implantation. 19,20 Silk fibroin acts as an enzyme immobilisation matrix with good mechanical properties, blood compatibility and good dissolved oxygen permeability in the wet state. Indeed, there have been reports on silk fibroin/chitosan blend membranes with positive mechanical properties forming an interpenetrating polymer network. [21][22][23] Hydroxyapatite, due to its bioactive, biodegradable and osteoconductive properties, has been used extensively in biomedical implant and bone regeneration applications. 24 For the treatment of periodontal osseous defects and alveolar ridge augmentation, hydroxyapatite has been used in the form of a particulate. 25,26 One complication that arises when using hydroxyapatite is the migration from the implant site into the surrounding tissue because its manipulation properties are comparable to those of sand. 27,28 Therefore, for the purposes of hard-tissue generation, it is desirable to develop a hybrid material that combines the favourable properties of a chitosan-based biopolymer and hydroxyapatite. We hypothesized that when CFB-HAP membranes are implanted as a tissue scaffold, the relatively fast degradation of chitosan makes room for the growth of new tissue and increases the opportunity for the host bone to assimilate the hydroxyapatite. 29 Bio-Gide is a well-known and commonly used collagen membrane. Membrane-derived collagen fibres can trap some osteoinductive factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factors, insulin-like growth factors and fibroblast growth factors that are easily released from the bone matrix when an artificial bone cavity is formed. Because connective tissue facing the compact layer of the membrane does not show any osteogenesis, some osteoinductive factors accumulate on the collagen fibres of the porous layer that faces the cavity. Even if collagen itself has no ability to bind these osteoinductive factors, it can bind several extracellular matrix proteins that have a high affinity for these factors. 30 If so, it is possible that several osteoinductive factors would be trapped by the collagen fibres of the membrane, making previously migrated cells differentiate into an osteoblastic lineage. Additionally, Type I collagen can play a direct and important role in osteoblastic differentiation. [31][32] For the reasons noted above, many clinicians have reported high success rates when using Bio-Gide for GBR.",
