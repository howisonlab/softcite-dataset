However, its effects are difficult to quantify because it rapidly breaks down in aqueous solution to the stable compound 2 0-deoxyriboguanylurea (GuaUre-dR). Here, we used a phosphoramidite that permits the introduction of GuaUre-dR at defined positions in synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides to demonstrate that it is a potent inhibitor of human DNA methyltransferase 1 (hDNMT1) and the bacterial DNA methyltransferase (M.EcoRII) and that it is a mutagen that can form productive base pairs with either Guanine or Cytosine. Pure GuaUre-dR was found to be an effective demethylating agent and was able to induce 5azaC-dR type fragile sites FRA1J and FRA9E in human cells. Moreover, we report that demethylation associated with C:G ! G:C transversion and C:G ! T:A transition mutations was observed in human cells exposed to pure GuaUre-dR. The data suggest that most of the effects attributed to 5azaC-dR are exhibited by its stable primary breakdown product.",

It can elicit massive chromatin restructuring (7,8), and can elicit re-expression of silent genes regardless of their promoter methylation state (9). These effects are thought to be associated with its capacity to produce demethylated DNA via in vivo reduction to 5-aza-2 0 -deoxycytidine (5azaC-dR) and incorporation into DNA, where its capacity for epigenetic and genetic damage (10) is associated with the trapping (11) and subsequent destruction of DNA methyltransferase 1 (12).",

Both are rapidly hydrolyzed to the 2 0 -deoxyriboguanylurea forms (GuaUre-R and GuaUre-dR) in aqueous media at neutral pH (13) with a half-life of about 10 h. Its half-life in DNA is predicted to be slightly longer although reliable measurements of its stability in DNA are unavailable. Direct evidence for the presence of 5azaC in DNA isolated from prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells exposed to either 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR has not been obtained. Incorporation into DNA has been inferred from the more pronounced biological effects of 5azaC-dR compared with 5azaC-R (14) and the capacity of isolated DNA to contain tightly bound proteins (15). The genetic evidence is consistent with the predicted chemical breakdown since both 5azaC-R and 5azaC-dR mutagenesis produces a significant number of C:G ! G:C transversion and C:G ! T:A transition mutations in both bacteria (1) and mammals (10). Transversions are best explained by the capacity of GuaUre-dR in DNA to pair with cytosine as proposed by Jackson-Grusby et al. (10), while the transition mutations are consistent with either bypass synthesis after glycolytic removal of GuaUre-dR or mispairing of GuaUre-dR or 5azaC-dR with dA.",

Alternatively, it could be incorporated directly into DNA as an analog of either deoxycytidine or deoxyguanine. Most protocols (16) employing 5azaC-R to study bacterial cells require exposure to the drug over a short period (1-5 h). Thus, 5azaC-R incorporated into DNA as a cytidine analog is expected to account for the bulk of the incorporation in these experiments. In contrast, 5azaC-R protocols for studies in eukaryotic cells require prolonged exposure (24-72 h) to 1 mM drug in aqueous solution where it is rapidly hydrolyzed to GuaUre-dR that may be incorporated directly into DNA.",

Direct exposure of human cells to GuaUre-dR was also found to mimic the ability of 5azaC-dR in the induction of fragile sites FRA1J and FRA9E that were previously thought to be uniquely induced by 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR. We used PCR mapping to study the base-pairing spectrum generated during amplification at sites of GuaUre-dR incorporation in the template strand. Those results suggest that GuaUre-dR mediated mutagenesis mimics 5azaC-R and 5azaC-dR mediated mutagenesis in that it produces both C:G ! G:C transversions and C:G ! T:A transitions.",

The inhibition kinetics for each enzyme were best fit by competition between the productive substrate with dC targeted by the methyltransferase and the non-productive substrate with GuaUre-dR targeted by the enzyme. Figure 2 shows the kinetics of the methyltransferase reaction when either dC or GuaUre-dR is targeted by a symmetrically placed 5-methylcytosine residue in hemimethylated DNA. Kinetic parameters for the hemimethylated reaction targeting dC are easily determined from the saturation plot for that substrate. However, the hemimethylated reaction targeting GuaUre-dR is very slow, making exact determination of the Km for the GuaUre-dR targeted substrate uncertain. To obtain kinetic parameters for this substrate, reaction rates were determined for a fixed concentration of the hemimethylated dC targeted substrate in the presence of varying amounts of hemimethylated GuaUre-dR targeted substrate. The kinetics are described by the following rate equation 31:",

Consequently, GuaUre-dR incorporated directly into DNA as a dG analog would be expected to be essentially non-mutagenic. We used PCR amplification of synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides containing GuaUre-dR at preselected sites to infer probable replication base pairing at template sites containing GuaUre-dR ( Figure 7). Based on this analysis the base pairing frequencies for GuaUre-dR were GuaUre-dR:dG ) GuaUre-dR:dA > GuaUre-dR:-dC, suggesting that Taq polymerase codes GuaUre-dR primarily as a dC analog during PCR amplification. It should be noted that in this analysis oligodeoxynucleotides are expected to form tandem arrays after ligation in the ligation mediated PCR procedure. The clones isolated from oligodeoxynucleotides containing GuaUre-dR on only one of the two strands in the duplex generally contained tandem arrays of 2-5 copies of the oligodeoxynucleotide. However, tandem arrays were not observed when the input oligodeoxynucleotide contained GuaUre-dR on both strands. This clearly suggests that GuaUre-dR is a replication block to the Taq polymerase.",

The intrinsic stability of cytosine in B-DNA can be attributed largely to the activation energy associated with the formation of the dihydrocytosine intermediate required for hydrolytic deamination. In that case two sp3 carbons must be introduced into the cytosine ring forcing a dramatic disruption of the structure of the DNA double helix that is resisted by the stacking energy of the duplex. Low levels of cytosine hydrate formed in aqueous solution are expected. However, restoration of the cytosine ring by \u00df-elimination is favored by the stacking energy, hence cytosine deamination mutations are rare. In contrast, the dihydroazacytidine intermediate can form more easily than dihydrocytidine intermediate because C6 is more electrophilic in the triazine ring and because the deformation of the ring is less pronounced because only one sp3 carbon is formed as N5 remains essentially planar. Further, once formed the dihydroazacytidine intermediate is unstable and rapidly breaks down to the guanylurea restoring the planar system in duplex DNA. Essentially, the electrophilicity of 5azaC-dR in DNA can be viewed as driving nucleophilic attack and the stacking energy of the duplex can be viewed as driving the breakdown of the dihydroazacytidine intermediate. Consequently, 5azaC is expected to be intrinsically unstable in DNA. In short, the chemistry of the triazine ring in DNA strongly suggests that direct incorporation of 5azaC-dR in DNA will rapidly result in the production of GuaUre-dR at sites of incorporation, and that GuaUre-dR incorporated directly into DNA would produce the same end result: GuaUre-dR in DNA.",

G:C transversions at the d(CG) site (10). One possible explanation for the excess of C:G ! G:C transversions is that DNMT1 attacks 5azaC-dR in DNA followed by hydrolysis within the active site of the enzyme to produce formylated DNMT1 and GuaUre-dR at the CG site (10), allowing GuaUre-dR thus formed to code for dC at replication. Several lines of evidence argue against this model. First, the active site of DNMT1 is essentially impervious to water as demonstrated by the complete lack of cytosine deamination during catalytic methylation (35). Consequently, anhydrous nucleophilic attack at C6 by the active site cysteine is expected to produce C6-DNMT dihydroazacytidine in equilibrium with a ring-open covalent intermediate (see Supplementary  Figure S1). Second, substitution of the weaker serine nucleophile for the cysteine at the active site of DNMT1 does not block its subsequent enzyme degradation (12). Third, the model does not account for the significant number of C:G ! T:A transitions and C:G ! A:T transversions that are detected after mutagenesis by 5azaC-dR (10). Fourth, in bacteria C:G ! A:T transversions and C:G ! G:C transversions are preferentially selected after 5azaC-R mutagenesis in the absence of methytransferase interaction (1).",

The predominance of transversions in vivo would then be associated with either the removal of GuaUre-dR by DNA glycosylases or the formation of abasic sites followed by the incorporation of dA by bypass synthesis, or the mispairing of GuaUre-dR with dA ( Figure 7).",

That evidence clearly shows that copying by Taq polymerase favors GuaUre-dR:dG paring and not GuaUre-dR:dC paring during amplification. Given that the \u00c1Tm for each of these ring-open conformations relative to the dC:dG pair is comparable ( Supplementary Table S1), we infer that the GuaUre-dR:dG base pair is preferred because it most closely approximates the geometry of the dC:dG basepair (38). The in vivo mutational spectrum at the APC gene after exposure to GuaUre-dR strongly suggests that it is highly mutagenic. Transversions and deletions were produced at an aggregate frequency of 1.56 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 /bp while transition mutations were detected at a lower aggregate frequency 0.39 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 /bp, suggesting that mutations generated by abasic sites formed after base excision are more prevalent than mispairing mutations in human cells.",

            "text": "Although the base-pairing properties of GuaUre-dR provide the best explanation for the observed mutagenesis by 5azaC-R in both bacteria (1) and mammals (10), as a ring-open base, it may not be a particularly good substrate for direct incorporation into DNA by mammalian DNA polymerases. However, direct incorporation of GuaUre-dR is again made plausible by the ability of this drug to induce the 5-azacytidine-type chromosomal fragile sites: FRA1J and FRA9E ( Figure 5, Table 2). These fragile sites have hitherto been uniquely associated the induction by 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR. The possibility that GuaUre-dR is directly incorporated into DNA is supported by the similarity between fragile sites FRA1J and FRA9E and the 1qh and 9qh undercondensations often observed in ICF syndrome (39). Since ICF syndrome is caused by mutations in human DNMT3b it is reasonable to suspect that GuaUre-dR and 5azaC-dR are incorporated into DNA where they inhibit DNMT3b directly. However, the present data does not directly demonstrate incorporation into DNA. Consequently, it remains possible that these drugs merely block a process involved in chromosome condensation that requires DNMT3b activity. In any event, the data reported here clearly demonstrates that induction of these fragile sites is not unique to 5azaC-dR, and suggests that induction of fragile sites by GuaUre-dR, like 5azaC-dR induced mutagenesis, is the result of its breakdown to GuaUre-dR, which can occur rapidly. In general, cell lines are treated with 5azaC-R or 5azaC-dR for between 3 and 5 days (40,41). During that time the concentration of either compound will decrease from 1 mM usually used to 1 nM while the concentration of GuaUre-R or GuaUre-dR will increase correspondingly to about 1 mM (13,33).",

Given that the mammalian cytidine kinase is quite promiscuous (43) phosphorylation of either GuaUre-R or GuaUre-dR should be effective in mammalian cells. This suggests that the inability of GuaUre-R to kill L1210 cells in a mouse model (43) may reside in the inability of ribnucleotide reductase to convert the monophosphate GuaUre-RMP to GuaUre-dRMP. This is consistent with the relatively low LD50 associated with GuaUre-dR in PC3 prostate tumor cells, and with more recent studies showing that epigenetic therapy with 5azaC-dR alone was only moderately effective against solid tumor cells (44). Durable responses in solid tumors appear to require low doses of methyltransferase inhibitors in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors followed by a course of cytotoxic therapy (45), suggesting that epigenetic alterations induced by these drugs may sensitize tumors to subsequent cytotoxic thereapy. In any event, for a rapidly dividing cell culture, one can expect $10-20% of the input 5azaC-dR to be incorporated into DNA where it will spontaneously hydrolyze to GuaUre-dR.",

Moreover, since tight binding to mispairs in a variety of contexts is a fundamental property of DNMT1 this mechanism is consistent with a stoichiometric role for DNMT1 in mammalian DNA Figure 7.
