In this study, as part of the MAQC-II project, we systematically compared the classification performance resulting from one-and two-color gene-expression profiles of 478 neuroblastoma samples. In total, 196 classification models were applied to these measurements to predict four clinical endpoints, and classification performances were compared in terms of accuracy, area under the curve, Matthews correlation coefficient and root mean-squared error. Whereas prediction performance varied with distinct clinical endpoints and classification models, equivalent performance metrics were observed for one-and two-color measurements in both internal and external validation. Furthermore, overlap of selected signature genes correlated inversely with endpoint prediction difficulty. In summary, our data strongly substantiate that the choice of platform is not a primary factor for successful gene expression based-prediction of clinical endpoints.",

The resulting data are fundamentally different: while two-color arrays yield ratios of fluorescence intensities (that is, sample fluorescence/reference fluorescence), one-color arrays result in absolute fluorescence intensities, which are assumed to be monotonically (if not linearly) related to the abundance of mRNA species complementary to the probes on the array.",

While simplicity and flexibility of the experimental design might favor onecolor analyses in a clinical setting, two-color measurements are often believed to be more robust due to the internal reference, which should cancel out biases related to single array measurements. [2][3][4] However, two-color approaches may be affected by dye bias 5 and, although dye influence can be corrected for by performing dye-flipped replicate hybridizations, this strategy substantially augments experimental costs. Therefore, most researchers refrain from following such an approach. Moreover, considerable logistic effort has to be undertaken for two-color analysis, since reference RNA (or cDNA) must be available in constant quality throughout the course of the measurements, even if the study may take years to complete. It is also not easy to choose an appropriate reference for each application, and there have been controversial discussions on the use of reference RNAs with divergent similarity to the sample RNAs of the study. 6,7 While some laboratories stick to mixtures of RNA prepared from various human tissues (far reference), it may be sometimes more appropriate to choose a pool of related cell lines or tissue samples as a source of reference RNA (near reference), which represent an average over all samples of the study.",

Therefore, it is still unclear if either of these platforms is better suited for clinical applications that aim at predicting the endpoint of a disease. Consequently, preference of either experimental system is at present mostly motivated by criteria that are not primarily related to the experimental question, such as the local availability of a specific system, the financial effort of the intended survey, or presumed but unconfirmed belief of the superiority of either system.",

Following the basic design of the MAQC-II study, in which two-color profiles of neuroblastoma samples were divided into a training set (n \u00bc 246) and an approximately equal-size-blinded validation set (n \u00bc 253), one-color profiles of the same tumor samples were generated for 244/246 MAQC-II NB two-color training set samples (99% overlap) and 234/253 MAQC-II NB validation set samples (92.5% overlap). The reasons for lacking one-color profiles were: (i) shortage of RNA or tumor material (n \u00bc 15), (ii) poor experimental quality for one-color profile (n \u00bc 5) and (iii) correlation of one one-color profile to two different two-color profiles for one patient of the validation set who had been profiled with different versions of the 2 \u00c2 11K microarray (see Methods and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). For the comparative analysis, only those 478 samples that had been profiled with both platforms were considered. It is interesting to note that Agilent Technologies no longer manufactured the 2 \u00c2 11K design used for generation of the two-color profiles. For this reason one-color profile had to be generated utilizing a 4 \u00c2 44K oligonucleotide microarray manufactured by the same company. This higher-density 4 \u00c2 44K microarray comprised all probes from the 2 \u00c2 11K oligonucleotide microarray. Thus, data from the resulting gene-expression profiles of both platforms was restricted to a common set of 9986 probes represented by both designs to allow for a reasonable comparison of classification performance of oneor two-color measurements. It is interesting to note that some parameters of the labelling and hybridization procedure had to be adjusted for the higher-density 4 \u00c2 44K format thus resulting in slight differences between the onecolor and two-color experimental protocols (details are indicated in the Methods section and summarized in Supplementary Table S4).",

As indicated in Figure 1, cross-validated predictive performance varied primarily between the different endpoints. This result was expected as two endpoints were introduced as positive (patients' sex, endpoint L) and negative (random selection, endpoint M) control endpoints, respectively. These endpoints were further characterized by a balanced group distribution of the samples (Table 1). For the positive endpoint L, nearly perfect classification performance was reached (MCC: 0.87-0.95, mean MCC: 0.93; AUC: 0.96-0.98, mean AUC: 0.97) while results for the negative endpoint M were close to random prediction  Table 1, the latter two endpoints present highly unbalanced distribution among the samples. Second, as shown in Figure 1, minor differences in classification performance were observed between the different classification models applied to the data sets. However, as the most important finding with respect to the objective of our study, no substantial difference in classification performance was observed between the two different experimental platforms as indicated by a remarkably high correlation between one-color and two-color performance observed for all four classification criteria (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, to assess the robustness of predictive models from one-color and two-color measurements, the variance of the performance was estimated by calculating the s.d. of the performance metrics MCC, AUC, RMSE and accuracy from repeated runs of the algorithms. As expected, s.d. depended on both the clinical endpoint and the classification algorithm used for prediction. However, apart from these effects, we also observed that the s.d. of performance metrics was consistently lower when classifiers were trained on twocolor data. This observation is illustrated in Figure 2, in which s.d. of AUC are indicated for different endpoints for each of the classification algorithms. The only exception is classifiers for endpoint L using LR, PAM, PLS, RBM or SVM \u00fe RFE as classification algorithms (Figure 2). Thus, the variability of the prediction was in general lower when classifiers were trained from two-color data, whereas the average estimate of predictive performance was not different (Figure 1).",

As an exception, a slight tendency towards higher prediction performance with onecolor data was noted for classifiers built on PLS and LR, for which this effect was detectable for all endpoints (Figure 3,  Supplementary Figure 2).

However, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1, these effects were clearly restricted to these models and the combination of specific models with certain endpoints, respectively.

From these, a large number of classification models was generated to predict four endpoints defined for the MAQC-II study and performance was assessed by the metrics MCC, AUC, RMSE and accuracy both for internal and external validation. Cumulatively, our analysis indicates a largely equivalent overall performance of both platforms, thereby suggesting that the choice of a one-color or of a two-color platform does not need to be a primary factor in decisions regarding experimental microarray design in classification studies.",

Furthermore, since two different microarray designs (2 \u00c2 11K vs 4 \u00c2 44K) had to be used for this study, predictive models were built on a set of roughly 10 000 probes common to both designs. Although every effort was made to conduct the analyses comprised in this study as similar as possible, some minor differences in the experimental procedures were inevitable. First, because of a change to a higher density microarray design (4 \u00c2 44k) for the one-color profiles, the protocols differed slightly, mainly with respect to the hybridization temperature (60 1C for two-color, 65 1C for one-color, see Supplementary Table 3). Second, two-color samples were measured as dye-swap replicates yielding two profiles per patient, whereas singlecolor arrays where performed without replications. A third factor was the standardization of the two-color data relative to a signal from a reference channel, which is intrinsic to the method. Despite these differences, classification performance was observed to be highly comparable as measured by repeated internal 5 \u00c2 cross validation, thereby underlining the validity of our approach. A marginally higher robustness of classifiers trained from two-color data was suspected based on the lower variance of performance measures observed with two-color measurements. However, considering the fact that two-color data were generated as dye-flipped replicates (resulting in two measurements per patient), this observation can be explained by the higher degree of replication in the two-color data set. Alternatively, measurement against an internal reference on the same chip could have resulted in a stabilization of the two-color data.",

However, a slightly higher performance of classifiers trained on one-color data was observable for three of the eight classification algorithms used, namely PLS, LR and for endpoint M also PT. This finding could point to a tendency of overfitting of these classifiers when trained on two-color data. However, it should be noted that a higher classification performance of the negative endpoint M (as observed for PT built on one-color data) rather indicates a limited suitability of that classifier. Alternatively, the observation of higher performance of some models with one-color data might be related to the feature selection algorithms used in combination with these algorithms. As the number of features selected for classification was generally lower for classifiers generated from one-color data, it can be hypothesized that one-color gene-expression measurements were less noisy and more stable as compared to log-ratio data from two color arrays. However, since this effect was neither visible with other classification algorithms nor in the internal validation by cross-validation, we conclude that the observed differences in performance do not indicate a general effect that results from the choice of the platform.",

In addition, overlapping genes do not appear to be a true indicator of performance, since it has been shown clearly that differing sets of genes may be derived from a single data set and perform equally well in terms of classification. 18 Yet, the fact that both platforms identified features with biological relevance with high overlap for an easily predictable endpoint (L) appears to further underscore the equivalent potential of both approaches.",
