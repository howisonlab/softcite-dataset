            "text": "Background: Immunotherapy based on cytokine-induced killer cells or combination of dendritic cells and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK/DC-CIK) showed promising clinical outcomes for treating esophageal cancer (EC). However, the clinical benefit varies among previous studies. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the curative efficacy and safety of CIK/ DC-CIK immunotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for conventional therapeutic strategies in the treatment of EC. Materials and methods: Clinical trials published before October 2016 and reporting CIK/ DC-CIK immunotherapy treatment responses or safety for EC were searched in Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Wanfang and China National Knowledge Internet databases. Research quality and heterogeneity were evaluated before analysis, and pooled analyses were performed using random-or fixed-effect models. Results: This research covered 11 trials including 994 EC patients. Results of this metaanalysis indicated that compared with conventional therapy, the combination of conventional therapy with CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy significantly prolonged the 1-year overall survival (OS) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) (1-year OS: P=0.0005; ORR and DCR: P,0.00001). Patients with combination therapy also showed significantly improved quality of life (QoL) (P=0.02). After CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy, lymphocyte percentages of CD3 + and CD3-CD56 + subsets (P,0.01) and cytokines levels of IFN-\u03b3,-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 (P,0.00001) were significantly increased, and the percentage of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 + CD25 + CD127subset was significantly decreased, whereas analysis of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD4 + /CD8 + and CD3 + CD56 + did not show significant difference (P.0.05). Conclusion: The combination of CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy and conventional therapy is safe and markedly prolongs survival time, enhances immune function and improves the treatment efficacy for EC."

            "text": "In recent years, immunotherapy has been rising rapidly and is considered the fourth powerful therapeutic method after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. 6 Cancer immunotherapy is accomplished in multiple ways, including manipulation of the immune system through the use of immune agents, such as vaccines, 7 cytokines, 8 checkpoint inhibitors (including anti-programmed death 1 [PD-1]/PD-ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibodies and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4 antibodies), 9,10 kinase inhibitors (such as apatinib and gefitinib) 11,12 and immune cells. [13][14][15][16][17][18][19] However, their applications have the following hurdles. Simply activating the immunity via vaccination is not able to thoroughly eliminate tumor cells because cancer patients are usually in immunosuppression. 19 Promotion of molecule-targeted treatment for tumors is also confined only to cancer patients bearing specific antigenexpressing cells. 13 Notably, adoptive cellular immunotherapy has been flourishing in cancer treatment. Its effectiveness relies on the application of dendritic cells (DCs), 14 tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), 15 natural killer (NK) cells, 16 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), 17 cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells 18 and other immune cells. CIK cells, which consist primarily of the CD3 + CD56 + subset, are induced by interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-1, cluster of differentiation (CD)3 monoclonal antibodies (OKT3) and IL-2 in vitro. 5 Compared with other immune cells, CIK cells are easy to obtain from peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, and they possess higher in vitro proliferation capacity, stronger antitumor activity and broader antitumor spectrum. 6 The tumoricidal ability of CIK cells is implemented by inducing tumor cell apoptosis through direct contact and secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. 20 CIK cells have shown promising prospects in immunotherapy for cancers. On the one hand, the cytotoxicity of CIK cells is not affected by immune inhibitors such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506. 21 On the other hand, CIK cell-mediated cytotoxicity does not rely on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). As in most cancers, these cells do not express MHC or human leukocyte antigen (HLA); this property of CIK cells is a great advantage over other immune cells in adoptive cell therapy. 22 DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells and are essential in CIK activation, proliferation, phenotype expression and cytokine secretion. 5,23,24 The cytotoxicity of CIK cells is remarkably enhanced when cocultured with DCs, indicated by the increased proportion of CD3 + CD56 + cells and the improved levels of cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1. 6,23 Meanwhile, cocultured DCs also downregulate the expression of negative regulatory factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and IL-10, as well as the proportion of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) among CIK cells, which suppress the antitumor activity of CIK. 5,24 Several research reports have shown that the combination of DCs and CIKs (DC-CIK) is more effective and has indicated more promising clinical prospects than single CIK treatment. 6 In EC treatment, there are emerging data indicating CIK or DC-CIK (CIK/DC-CIK) immunotherapy in combination with conventional therapy exhibited better therapeutic efficacy than conventional therapy alone. [25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37] However, CIK/ DC-CIK immunotherapy clinical application is still in its infancy. In this research, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of CIK/DC-CIK combined with conventional therapy in comparison with conventional therapy alone for EC, in order to provide scientific evidence for future clinical trials.",

Our meta-analysis revealed that the combination of CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy and conventional therapy was a safe and effective regimen for the treatment of EC. Compared to conventional regimens alone, patients with combination therapy demonstrated higher OS rate, ORR and DCR, as well as improved immune function and QoL. This study confirmed the safety of CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy for EC patients, and the adverse events caused were tolerated by all patients. Fever was the most common side effect when patients were treated with combination conventional-plus-CIK/DC-CIK therapy, and its incidence was higher than when treated by conventional therapy alone (P,0.05). No significant difference was observed in terms of other adverse events, such as leukopenia, gastrointestinal adverse reaction and peripheral neurotoxicity between the 2 groups (P.0.05). CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy enhanced the efficiency of conventional therapy in the treatment of EC. Compared with the conventional therapy-alone group, 1-year OS, ORR and DCR of patients in the combination therapy group were improved remarkably (P,0.01). Moreover, the combination therapy improved patients' QoL (P,0.05) by relieving pain, reducing fatigue and insomnia as well as improving appetite.",

            "text": "Health status is closely related to human immune function, and a healthy human body has a robust immune system to detect and kill cancer cells. 5,6 However, the immune function in cancer patients is compromised, and the percentage of T-lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood is usually disordered. 5,6 Immune system reconstruction is one of the key factors to effectively treat malignant tumors. 6 The antitumor activity of CIK/DC-CIK is mainly attributed to CD3 -CD56 + and CD3 + CD56 + cells. 41 Our analysis indicated that the proportions of CD3 + , CD3 -CD56 + and CD3 + CD56 + T cells were increased after CIK/DC-CIK treatment, although the percentages of CD3 + CD56 + T cells did not reach statistical significance. However, no significant differences were found in the percentages of CD4 + , CD8 + and CD4 + /CD8 + ratios before and after immunotherapy. This may be caused by the different time points when the T-lymphocyte subsets were tested in these trials. 6,19,42,43 Our analysis revealed a decreased proportion of CD4 + CD25 + CD127 -Tregs. This is consistent with a previous study that illustrated a negative role of Tregs in the implementation of CIK's antitumor activity. 44 Besides, the balance between the 2 helper T-cell (Th1 and Th2 cells) classes is also important in immunotherapy. 5,41 Th1 cells enhance killer cells' cytotoxicity and trigger delayed-type hypersensitivity, whereas Th2 cells are associated with tumor immune escape. 5,45 Our analysis showed that after CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy, the levels of Th1 cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12, were significantly increased (P,0.00001), indicating a strong association between Th1 cytokines and efficacy of CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy. Although our results indicated that CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy enhanced the immune function in EC patients, the exact underlying mechanism of action of CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy on hosts' immune system remains unclear, which requires further studies on its mechanism.",

First of all, although CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy has been applied to treat malignancies worldwide for its outstanding curative effects, [46][47][48] all of the clinic trials that met our inclusion criteria were carried out in the Chinese population. We will follow updated publications on CIK/DC-CIK immunotherapy for EC conducted both in China and other countries and subsequently perform further systematic research on it. Moreover, the analysis performed in this study was not subjected to an open external evaluation procedure, which may lead to an overestimation of treatment effects. In addition, insufficient information regarding some patients, small sample sizes and other variables may have introduced bias into our conclusions. Besides, the clinical application of adoptive CIK/ DC-CIK immunotherapy was limited due to the low specificity, although it is a promising strategy for the treatment of malignant tumors. Many new methods of immunotherapy, such as chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells and T-cell receptor-modified T cells, have been developed currently, [49][50][51] limiting the importance of this study.",
