            "text": "Pinus sylvestris L. var. mongolica Litv. (Pinaceae) is indigenous to the region north of the Greater Khingan Mountains and the Hulunbeier Grassland of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ( Zhu et al., 2006 ). This pine tree can live up to 150-200 yr and grow as tall as 15 m. It has strong cold resistance, enabling it to survive temperatures as low as -40 \u00b0 C, and is highly adaptable to various soil types with good growth on both barren and fertile land ( Zhu et al., 2003 ). Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica is the best evergreen coniferous tree species for establishing windbreaks and providing sand fi xation ( Zhao et al., 2010 ). Due to these characteristics, it has economic and ecological benefi ts, and has been introduced and cultivated in many arid and semiarid regions of China, such as Chengde in Hebei Province ( Zhao and Liu, 2007 ), Zhanggutai in Liaoning Province ( Zeng et al., 2005 ), and Yulin in Shaanxi Province ( Wang et al., 2009 ). This species originated from Honghuaerji in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region ( Zhu et al., 2006 ). Molecular genetic studies have been few in number ( Li et al., 2005 ), and no simple sequence repeats (SSRs) have been reported. To optimize the conservation and utilization of P . sylvestris var. mongolica , the development of expressed sequence tag (EST)-SSR markers is very useful for germplasm identification and research into the genetic diversity of this species.",

SSRs derived from EST sequences are more convenient and can be isolated with higher effi ciency and at lower expense than genomic sequence SSRs . In a previous study, Niu et al. (2013) analyzed the evolution of genes in Pinus species and showed by clustering analysis that P . sylvestris var. mongolica is more closely related to P. tabuliformis Carri\u00e8re than to three other Pinus species. Entries in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) on Pinaceae SSRs account for only 0.42% of all entries related to SSRs to date (1 May 2013), and none of them focus on P . sylvestris var. mongolica . Because transcriptome sequence data are not available for P. sylvestris var. mongolica , we used the data available from P. tabuliformis to develop the markers described here. We developed and characterized 25 novel polymorphic EST-SSR markers for this species. These EST-SSR markers provide an important tool for the study of genetic diversity in P . sylvestris var. mongolica .",

Fifty-six primer pairs were identifi ed that yielded stable, clear, and repeatable amplicons in P . sylvestris var. mongolica . The other primer pairs were unstable or gave no product. The 56 primers corresponded to 31 loci that were monomorphic (data not shown) and 25 loci that were polymorphic ( Table 1 ). The polymorphic SSR loci were analyzed with POP-GENE version 1.32 software ( Yeh et al., 1999 ) for the number of alleles per locus ( A ), observed heterozygosity ( H o ), expected heterozygosity ( H e ), and fi xation index ( F IS ). Detailed data are shown in Table 2 . The A values ranged from two to eight with a mean of 3.12. The H o and H e values were 0.0435-0.8125 and 0.0430-0.7820 with averages of 0.3412 and 0.4027, respectively. The F IS values ranged from -0.2877 to 0.6773 with an average of 0.1175. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and linkage disequilibrium using Bonferroni correction were tested for every locus. The following loci deviated signifi cantly ( P < 0.002) from HWE: (CTAB) method ( Porebski et al., 1997 ). The samples were collected from a single seed orchard in Qigou, Hebei Province (41 \u00b0 0 \u2032 13 \u2033 N, 118 \u00b0 27 \u2032 38 \u2033 E) and deposited at the National Engineering Laboratory for Forest Tree Breeding, China (NELFTB). All trees in the seed orchard derived from Honghuaerji in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Ltd., Beijing, China). The PCR reactions were performed in a Veriti Dx 96-well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 \u00b0 C for 30 s, annealing for 45 s at the optimal temperature for each primer pair , and 72 \u00b0 C for 30 s, with a fi nal extension of 10 min at 72 \u00b0 C ( Table 1 ). PCR products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gels using an HT-CX01 gel sequencing cell (Hongtao Jiye Technology Development Co. Ltd., Beijing, China).

The E -value was limited to 0-1.0E -5 . Gene Ontology (GO) was also used to predict functions of the unigenes (http://geneontology.org/). Eighteen sequences were found to have potential functions by BLASTX or GO analysis . These sequences showed signifi cant homology to protein sequences from Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carri\u00e8re, Picea glauca Voss, Selaginella moellendorffi i Hieron., Vitis vinifera L., Cucumis sativus L., and Zea mays L. The potential functions were mainly related to ionic bonding, oxidation-reduction processes, and feedback regulation ( Table 3 ). CONCLUSIONS Very few SSR markers for P . sylvestris var. mongolica have previously been reported. Here we have developed 25 novel EST-SSR polymorphic markers for this species. The 25 markers provide an effi cient tool for investigating population genetic diversity in different environments, as well as illuminating infraspecifi c phylogeography, mating systems, and gene fl ow in different populations.
