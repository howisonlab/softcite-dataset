            "text": "Introduction: Optic neuritis leads to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. The standard treatment is a methylprednisolone pulse therapy. This treatment slightly shortens the time of recovery but does not prevent neurodegeneration and persistent visual impairment. In a phase II trial performed in preparation of this study, we have shown that erythropoietin protects global retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT-G) in acute optic neuritis; however, the preparatory trial was not powered to show effects on visual function. Methods and analysis: Treatment of Optic Neuritis with Erythropoietin (TONE) is a national, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial with two parallel arms. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of erythropoietin compared to placebo given add-on to methylprednisolone as assessed by measurements of RNFLT-G and lowcontrast visual acuity in the affected eye 6 months after randomisation. Inclusion criteria are a first episode of optic neuritis with decreased visual acuity to \u22640.5 (decimal system) and an onset of symptoms within 10 days prior to inclusion. The most important exclusion criteria are history of optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis or any ocular disease (affected or non-affected eye), significant hyperopia, myopia or astigmatism, elevated blood pressure, thrombotic events or malignancy. After randomisation, patients either receive 33 000 international units human recombinant erythropoietin intravenously for 3 consecutive days or placebo (0.9% saline) administered intravenously. With an estimated power of 80%, the calculated sample size is 100 patients. The trial started in September 2014 with a planned recruitment period of 30 months. Ethics and dissemination: TONE has been approved by the Central Ethics Commission in Freiburg (194/14) and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (61-3910-4039831). It complies with the Declaration of Helsinki, local laws and ICH-GCP.",

Although it accelerates visual recovery, it does not influence visual outcome, lesion length or atrophy of the optic nerve. 1 In an animal model of ON, methylprednisolone even increased retinal ganglion cell degeneration by inhibition of a neurotrophin-dependent pathway. 2 Data from animal models of ON indicate that the downstream mechanisms of neurodegeneration involve pathways regulated by neurotrophins. 3 Erythropoietin (EPO) has shown neurotrophin-like properties in models of ischaemia, trauma, epilepsy and MS. 4 In contrast to 'classical' neurotrophins, EPO can be administered systemically. In an animal model of ON, EPO was particularly effective when given in combination with methylprednisolone. 5 Encouraged by these results, a phase II pilot trial was conducted in patients presenting with ON as a first clinical event indicative of MS. 6 In the EPO treatment group, a significant protection of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) was determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT).",

Safety monitoring revealed no specific issues. Thirty-seven patients (20/17 EPO/placebo) were analysed for the primary end point change in retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT) according to the intention-to-treat analysis. In patients treated with EPO, RNFLT decreased by a mean of 7.5 \u03bcm at week 16 compared to a mean of 16.0 \u03bcm in the placebo group ( p=0.03), measured with timedomain OCT. Decrease in retrobulbar diameter of the optic nerve was smaller in the EPO group ( p=0.01), determined by MRI. Testing of visual functions revealed trends towards an improved outcome after EPO treatment.

In a schizophrenia trial, 40 000 IU of EPO were given weekly over 3 months resulting in a need for bloodlettings in 8 of 39 patients. 7 In contrast, the treatment over 3 days in the pilot trial VISION PROTECT did not lead to any clinically relevant increases in red blood cell counts. 6 The majority of recorded adverse events in our pilot study 6 consisted of side effects associated with methylprednisolone such as hot flushes, facial flushing, mood changes or hyperglycaemia and did not occur more frequently in EPO-treated patients. Five of 40 patients complained of headache during the treatment period, 4 of whom had received EPO. Four serious adverse events were recorded throughout the study but were judged as unrelated to the study medication. Haemoglobin values showed a transient slight increase in the EPO-treated group after 1 week. Blood pressure after treatment with EPO remained stable during the treatment period and did not differ from values after methylprednisolone administration alone. Possible additional side effectsalthough not reported in the pilot study-include increases in red blood cell and thrombocyte counts, elevations of blood pressure and thromboembolic complications. 8 Since the risk of these events might especially be increased if EPO is combined with methylprednisolone, we exclude patients with vascular risk factors. Other exclusion criteria of our study such as history of malignancy or epilepsy are also explained by the spectrum of undesired effects of EPO. 8 Professional or semiprofessional sports activities belong to the exclusion criteria because EPO has been misused for doping, especially to enhance endurance of elite cyclists. 9 Additionally, pure red cell aplasia has been described as a rare but potentially fatal side effect of EPO. It is caused by neutralising antibodies induced by repetitive exposure to subcutaneous but eventually also intravenous EPO formulations. 10 For this reason, we included monitoring of antibodies against EPO into our safety assessment.",

The first is the mean (global) RNFLT of all retinal segments along a circle of 12\u00b0, that is, 3.5 mm diameter (RNFLT-G-12) of the fellow eye at baseline minus RNFLT-G-12 of the affected eye 6 months after randomisation. 13 RNFLT became a standard measure for neurodegeneration over the recent years. 13 14 Using time-domain OCT, thinning of the RNFL from 100 to 78 \u00b5m (means, p=0.0001) was seen in the majority of ON patients (74%) within 6 months. 15 RNFLT decline reaches a plateau around 4 months. 13 Several investigations have established that RNFLT measurement by OCT is a robust tool for the quantification of optic nerve axons and the degree of optic nerve atrophy, especially after ON. [16][17][18][19] The recent introduction of the spectral-domain OCT technique allows for more precise quantification of the RNFL, in particular using the Spectralis system which incorporates eye tracking for better retest variability (variation coefficient of 0.6% 20 compared with 5% using time-domain OCT). 21 RNFLT will be determined along a ring of 3.5 mm (approximately 12\u00b0) diameter concentrically centred on the Bruch's membrane opening at the optic disc using the Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). RNFLT has been employed as a primary outcome measure in VISION PROTECT and in ongoing trials NCT01451593 and NCT01073813 and has been recommended as such in the literature. 13 17 The second primary outcome measure is LCVA in the affected eye 6 months after randomisation. While high-contrast visual acuity (HCVA) recovers well after ON, 11 LCVA is most likely to remain subnormal: 22% of cases with fully recovered HCVA revealed subnormal LCVA. 22 LCVA correlates well with health-related quality of life 23 and correlates significantly with RNFLT 24 in patients with MS after previous ON. LCVA will be recorded by 2.5% low-contrast Sloan letter charts. 24 ",

We have based these assumptions on the available studies published so far. For healthy or unaffected fellow eyes, the RNFLT-G-12 ranges around 100 \u03bcm with a SD of less than 15 \u03bcm. 13 16 28-31 After ON, the following data have been published (RNFLT-G-12 in micrometre with mean\u00b1SD, follow-up interval): 68.7 \u00b118.8, 3 years after clinically isolated syndrome (CIS); 29 85\u00b117, >1 month after MS; 16 65\u00b117; <6 months after CIS; 30 84\u00b112, 12 months after CIS 31 and 83\u00b118, 6 months after CIS. 13 In the ON model, EPO reduced retinal ganglion cell loss by 50%. 5 Adapted to the RNFLT-G-12, this effect would result in about 10 \u03bcm RNFLT-G-12 difference which is in exact agreement with the effect size observed in VISION PROTECT. 6 These investigations are the basis of our assumptions: For patients with ON, a thinning of around 20% (15% to 25%) can be assumed in the placebo group.

No practically relevant differences on the nominal significance level have been observed in the investigations of this procedure. 33 Power calculations for LCVA For LCVA as the other primary end point, less evidence from published data is available so far. However, sample size and power calculations have been performed for LCVA in analogy to RNFLT-G-12. In patients with MS and previous ON, mean LCVA >3 months after onset of ON was 11.4 letters (SD 10.6) compared with 18.0 (SD 9.6) in MS non-ON eyes and 24.8 (SD 7.4) in healthy controls. 24 Median LCVA values of 15 in MS ON eyes, 24 in MS non-ON eyes and 32 in healthy controls were reported in another publication. 16 With 47 patients per arm, 80% power is achieved with an assumed SD of 10.6 for a group difference of 6.2, corresponding to an expected LCVA of 11.4+6.2=17.6 in the EPO arm. Similarly, 47 patients per arm provide 70% power for \u03b4 of 5.5 and expected LCVA of 16.9 in the EPO arm. Therefore, the proposed sample size based on RNFLT-G-12 provides sufficient power for the second primary outcome as well.",

Therefore, baseline RNFLT-G-12 measurements of the fellow eye will be used instead, as they are an adequate covariate to reduce variation of the treatment effect estimate.

The resulting treatment estimate from this model is identical (apart from the sign) to the treatment estimate resulting from a linear regression model with the same covariates, but using RNFLT-G-12 in the affected eye 6 months after randomisation instead as the dependent variable.

OCT allows for imaging of the proximal axon fibres of retinal ganglion cells, a subpopulation of central nervous system neurons, without the presence of confounding myelin sheaths. Additionally, visual dysfunction during and after ON can be precisely characterised by functional and electrophysiological measurements. This interdisciplinary study represents a conjoined effort of neurologists and ophthalmologists and is designed as a prospective, double-blind randomised clinical trial conducted in different German University Medical Centers. It substantiates a recent pilot trial by R Diem, which showed a neuroprotective effect for EPO in ON. 6 A positive outcome of TONE would not only improve the treatment for ON but also have implications on therapy development in MS, since RNFL atrophy is a surrogate marker for neuronal degeneration in MS 16 and correlates with general brain atrophy. 34 ",
