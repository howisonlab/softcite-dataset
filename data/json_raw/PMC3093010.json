            "text": "Background/Aims There are few reports on the correlation between chewing gum and the gastrointestinal functions. But previous report showed use of chewing gum to be an effective method for controlling gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between chewing gum and gastric emptying using the continuous real time 13 C breath test (BreathID system). Methods Ten healthy male volunteers participated in this randomized, 2-way crossover study. The subjects fasted overnight and were randomly assigned to chewing gum (Xylish, 2-3/1 tablet) for an hour following intake of a test meal (200 kcal/200 mL) or intake of the test meal alone. Gastric emptying was monitored for 4 hours after administration of the test meal by the 13 C-acetic acid breath test performed continually using the BreathID system. Results No significant differences in the calculated parameters, namely, T1/2 (median, 111.82 vs 109.26 minutes; P = 0.575), Tlag (median, 53.28 vs 56.53 minutes; P = 0.333), gastric emptying coefficient (median, 3.58 vs 3.65; P = 0.285), regression-estimated constant \u03b2 (median, 1.85 vs 1.80; P = 0.575) and regression-estimated constant \u03ba (median, 0.61 vs 0.62; P = 0.959) were observed between the test meal alone group and the test meal and chewing gum group. Conclusions This study showed that chewing gum had no effect on the rate of gastric emptying. Therefore, since chewing gum did not enhance the speed of gastric emptying, it may ameliorate gastrointestinal symptoms through other mechanisms, such as saliva and autonomic nervous system.",

The 2 tests were conducted as follows; (1) experiment A: the subjects chewed gum for an hour just minutes after intake of test meal and (2) experiment B: the subjects only took a test meal without chewing gum. The 2 tests were conducted separately with a washout period of at least 7 days according to previous reports. [6][7][8][9][10] In both the experiments, the tests were started after the patients had fasted overnight (at least 8 hours), and the breath test was performed while the subjects were seated. The test meal was a 200 kcal/200 mL liquid meal (Racol with milk flavor, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan; 1 pack [200 mL] include protein 8.76 g, fat 4.46 g and carbon 31.24 g) containing 100 mg of 13 C-acetic acid (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Boston, MA, USA), [5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] which the patients were requested to consume within 5 minutes.

[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The subject ingests 13 C-labeled acetic acid, which passes through the stomach and is absorbed into the duodenum and upper small bowel.

[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] Although this protocol was Japanese standardized method by Japan society of smooth muscle research, 5-9 the protocol was not used in major studies for reasons of small volume, light calorie and liquid meal. In Japan, we usually chew gum before meal or after heavy rich meal. We should research during fasting status or after heavy test meal. The previous study showed that gum chewing consistently increased the esophageal and pharyngeal pH. 1 According to another study, when gastroesophageal reflux occurs, the refluxate volume and acid clearance from the esophagus depend on 2 major mechanisms. Peristalsis initiates esophageal clearance, and swallowed saliva neutralizes the residual acid. 2 A common dietary stimulant for the production of saliva is chewing gum. Chewing gum increases the salivary flow rate. 2 Use of chewing gum has been shown as a comparatively safe and effective method of controlling acid reflux and the related symptoms. 2 Various type of foods has been shown to promote reflux either by decreasing the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, stimulating gastric secretion or noxiously interacting directly with the oesophageal mucosa. Over time, gastric emptying may cause retention of solid foods, gastric distention, resultant increase of gastric acid secretion and transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. 3,4 Therefore, the esophageal and pharyngeal pH values are increased after chewing. Sugar content has been suggested to influence the osmotic Figure 1. No significant differences were found in the T1/2 (A), Tlag (B), gastric emptying coefficient (C), regression-estimated constant \u03b2 (D) or regression-estimated constant \u03ba (E) between the 2 study condition, indicating that chewing gum had no significant effect on the rate of gastric emptying.",

The parasympathetic activity is reduced in patients who are unable to masticate and swallow food, resulting in adverse effects on the gastric motor and excretion functions. Mastication and swallowing not only prepare food for passage from the oral cavity into the esophagus, but are also important in terms of subsequent events that occur in the stomach. It has been proposed that auto-nomic nervous activity might be involved in mastication and swallowing. 22,23 Therefore, we thought that chewing of gum might accelerate gastric emptying. We guess that the form of test meals, their volume, the starting time of chewing gum, duration of chewing, gum volume and the relatively small number of subjects might have influenced the results of our study.",
