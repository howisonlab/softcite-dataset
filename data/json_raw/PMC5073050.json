            "text": "The primary aim of the study was to investigate whether the cAMP-stimulated Rap activator Epac contributes to the tonic control of microvessel baseline permeability in major organs of the mouse. The well-recognized endothelial permeability lowering effect of cAMP was first thought to be mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) only, but the likely involvement of Epac was demonstrated using Epac-activating cAMP analogues (Christensen et al., 2003) that lowered the permeability of monolayers of human embryonic vascular endothelial cells and attenuated the response to inflammatory conditions such as exposure to thrombin (Cullere et al. 2005). A role of Epac1 and its target, the small GTPase Rap, to modulate inflammation-associated endothelial hyperpermeability has been confirmed in numerous in vitro studies and noted in some in situ perfusion studies of accessible microvessels, although the relative roles of PKA, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and Epac in different organ vascular beds and under different experimental conditions still remain uncertain (for recent reviews, see Spindler et al. 2010, Surapisitchat & Beavo 2011, Kuhn 2012, Curry & Adamson 2013.",

A major reason is the lack of ways to reliably inhibit Epac and other cAMPdependent pathways pharmacologically in vivo (Spindler & Waschke 2011), in part due to rapid metabolism and renal clearance of cAMP analogues used to modulate Epac and PKA activity (Kleppe et al. 2015).",

ANP is released when plasma volume is expanded and increases vascular permeability to albumin as part of the normal control of plasma volume. We and others have demonstrated this action in Wt mice , Lin et al. 2011, and also shown that it is attenuated when cAMP is elevated, and proposed that ANP might increase permeability via decreased Epac activity (Lin et al. 2011). We show here that Epac1deficient mice, but not Epac2-deficient mice have an attenuated response to ANP.",

Arterial blood pressure (BP) was measured in five Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and six wild-type mice by the tail-cuff method following the instructions of the manufacturer (CODA5; Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT, USA). Briefly, the mice were pre-warmed in an incubator at 32\u00b0C for 30-45 min and then transferred to a tube for measuring the BP. The tubes were placed on a heating pad to keep the mice warm. The warming prevents tail vessel vasoconstriction and ensures optimal vasodilation for the blood pressure determination. Measurement of blood pressure was performed in five cycles, each 20 s. Each mouse was trained on day 1, and the blood pressure measured each of the two following days.",

It has been validated for determination of albumin leakage in Wt mice and explained in detail in . In brief, 125 I-HSA (0.1 MBq) was given i.v. over 30 s in 0.05 mL of saline. Thirty minutes thereafter, 131 I-HSA (0.05 MBq) was injected (also i.v. in 0.05 mL of saline over 30 s). Five minutes thereafter, cardiac blood was withdrawn for plasma sampling, and the mice were killed by i.v. injection of saturated KCl. Tissue samples were rapidly dissected from back skin (four samples: left and right upper and lower quadrant), skeletal muscle (quadriceps), heart, small intestine (jejunum), large intestine (colon) and adipose tissue (inguinal white fat). The tissues and plasma samples were transferred to pre-weighed vials, which were sealed and immediately reweighed. After determination of radioactivity, the tissue samples were de-sealed and evaporated in a drying chamber at 60\u00b0C. The vials were weighed repeatedly until stable weight (normally after 2-3 weeks) was reached. The radioactivity was determined in a gamma-counting system (LKB Wallac 1285, Turku, Finland). Spillover from 131 I to 125 I was corrected automatically. Blood-to-tissue clearance was estimated as the extravascular plasma equivalent volume of 125 I-HSA (counts min \u00c01 per g dry tissue weight)/(counts min \u00c01 per mL plasma). The clearance over 30 min is the difference between the plasma equivalent distribution volume of 125 I-HSA at 35 min and that of 131 I-HSA at 5 min. All clearances were referenced to tissue dry weight. The clearance data were also normalized to clearance per unit blood volume by dividing clearance by the plasma volume in the sample to minimize effects of variable blood filling between the samples (see Curry & Adamson 2010 for discussion).",

The Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice had significantly increased albumin clearance (normalized to plasma volume) in skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and large intestine (Fig. 2). An increase in albumin clearance when expressed relative to local plasma volume is a strong indication of an actual change in vascular permeability, as it compensates for differences in surface area for exchange. In contrast to Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, the Epac2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice had albumin clearance similar to Wt mice in skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and large intestine, but was increased in the small intestine (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that Epac1, but not Epac2, provided a significant contribution to the basal macromolecular endothelial permeability in most of the organs studied here.",

The initial rapid rise of the MRI signal after intravenous Gadomer-17 injection seen in Figure 3a reflected blood vessel filling and was similar for Wt and Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals, suggesting near-identical vascular volumes. Thereafter, the MR signal intensity became higher in muscle from Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice than Wt mice, indicating increased constitutive permeability in Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 microvasculature. Apparently, the loss of Epac1 affected a pathway for microvascular macromolecule exchange common for albumin and Gadomer-17 ( Fig. 3b). We finally tested whether lack of Epac1 also could blunt the known permeability decreasing effect of the cAMP elevating PDE4 inhibitor rolipram in the masseter muscle (Lin et al. 2011). Rolipram induced a lowering of Gadomer-17 permeability that was blunted in Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 masseter Figure 2 The normalized albumin clearance is increased in skin, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and large intestine of Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , but not Epac2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. The normalized clearance (NC) in tissue samples of back skin, skeletal muscle, white adipose tissue, small and large intestine, and heart is shown mL g \u00c01 dry weight (average AE SEM).

Error bars are SEM. P-values < 0.05 (*) are shown. (Fig. 3b). The results could not be explained by decreased microvascularity in the Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 masseter as its capillary density was similar to Wt masseter ( Fig. 3c-e). We conclude that Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 masseter has increased microvascular permeability both under basal and rolipram-stimulated conditions.",

It is not known whether ANP acts through Epac1 inhibition or independently of Epac1. We reasoned that if ANP acted independently of Epac or an Epac-induced pathway, it should enhance permeability to the same level in Wt and Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. We failed to note any further ANPinduced increase of permeability in the Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Fig. 4a,b), unlike in the Epac2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Fig. 4c). Besides, the albumin permeability enhancing effect of ANP was, if anything, slightly lower in magnitude than the effect of deleting Epac1 (Fig. 4a). The above results are consistent with an action of ANP to reduce the effectiveness of an Epac1 pathway to maintain the constitutive vascular permeability.",

As the tissue samples to be analysed for albumin isotope content were weighed before and after drying (see the Experimental section for details), we could compare their water content (relative to dry weight). Only in skin was the water content high enough to produce experimentally reliable data. Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 back skin had about 2% higher water content than back skin from Wt mice (Fig. 5). Further, the magnitude of the increase in water content was similar whether or not they were treated with ANP. This is not unexpected due to the short exposure time to ANP and the modest albumin permeability rate of back skin under the experimental conditions. In contrast, the Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have a constitutive opportunity to retain fluid subsequent to the increased albumin permeability.",

These analyses revealed a trend towards shorter and wider junctions in Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 capillaries (average length and width were 395 and 13 nm in Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 against 483 and 11 in Wt; P > 0.05). More importantly, a highly significant difference existed between Wt and Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 endothelial slits regarding the extent and density of junctional complex material. On average, Wt clefts had 224 nm of strongly developed junctional complex against only 97 nm for Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 clefts (Fig. 6a). Four of the 48 slit sections scrutinized from Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 microvessels had no constrictions <6 nm and no areas with strong accumulation of junctional complex material, against only one for the 57 studied slits from Wt mice. The most extreme examples of slit difference in distribution of electron-dense material are shown in Figure 6b-e. These observations demonstrated ultrastructural differences between endothelial slits from Wt and Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals under basal conditions, consistent with the finding that macromolecules such as Gadomer-17 and albumin have increased capillary permeability in Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 compared with Wt tissues.",

Our results therefore conform to the hypothesis that tonic activity of Epac1-dependent pathways contributes to the maintenance of baseline vascular permeability, and loss of this activity leads to a sustained increase in baseline permeability. We ascribe this phenotype to enhanced permeability of the interendothelial junctions of Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse microvessels. A number of studies implicate PKA alone or PKA and Epac together as responsible for cAMP-induced endothelial barrier tightening (Rampersad et al. 2010, Surapisitchat & Beavo 2011, Curry & Adamson 2013. The present study does not exclude an action of PKA in maintaining the endothelial barrier in vivo, but suggests that Epac1 has a dominant role compared to PKA in intact microvessels as treatment with rolipram, which would increase cAMP and PKA activity, failed to overcome the lack of Epac1 (Fig. 3). A similar dominant role of Epac1 was noted in arterial endothelial cells in vitro, where the junctional protein VE-cadherin colocalizes with PKA, a PDE4D/Epac1 complex, and the Epac target Rap1 in a 'signalosome' controlling the paracellular permeability (Rampersad et al. 2010). It is noted that these conclusions apply principally to the situation where the molecular complexes regulating cAMP are tethered close to the cell membrane. The tethering of PKA, Epac1 and their substrates close to sites of production of cAMP or cGMP and members of the cyclic nucleotide phoshodiesterase (PDE) family of cyclic nucleotide degrading enzymes is an important part of the regulatory scheme (Maurice 2011). Thus, lung endothelial cells responded to cAMP produced by a soluble bacterial adenylyl cyclase by interendothelial cell gap formation, facilitating bacterial invasion and oedema formation. The same cells showed restricted permeability, however, when cAMP was produced close to the surface membrane. In either case, the cAMP effect was attributed to PKA activation (Prasain et al. 2009, Ochoa et al. 2012.",

            "text": "Our observations provide new insight into mechanisms that regulate vascular permeability. In particular, they imply that Epac1 activity exerts a tonic inhibition of microvessel permeability. One potential way to relieve the Epac1-dependent inhibition in the intact animal is by lowering the cAMP concentration close to the endothelial junction. In fact, this has been proposed as explanation for the ANP-enhanced microvessel permeability. The ability of ANP to enhance microvascular albumin clearance depends on its binding to the endothelial cGMP producing receptor GC-A (Kuhn et al. 2009, Kuhn 2012. The resulting cGMP increase can (i) directly activate PKG, (ii) directly inhibit PDE3 degradation of cAMP and thus indirectly activate PKA and Epac, or (iii) directly activate PDE2 to indirectly lower cAMP and thereby reduce PKA and Epac activity (Surapisitchat et al. 2007, Birukova et al. 2008, Kuhn 2012). Epac1 does not bind cGMP at physiologically relevant concentrations (Christensen et al. 2003), but as in (iii) above, a cGMP burst can inhibit Epac indirectly by stimulating PDE2 to degrade cAMP in an endothelial cell compartment close to Epac1 (Kraynik et al. 2013). This scenario is compatible with the present findings as the ANP effect was blunted or absent in the Epac1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals ( Fig. 4a) and that rolipram, a strong inhibitor of the cAMP-specific PDE4, easily overrides ANPinduced hyperpermeability in vivo (Lin et al. 2011). Such overriding is less easily explained for purely cGMP-regulated putative ANP mediators like PKG (Schreier et al. 2008). Besides, the constitutive endothelial barrier resistance was lowered to at least a similar extent by Epac1 deficiency compared to exposure to ANP, as expected if ANP acted to inhibit Epac1 through a moderate decrease of endothelial cell cAMP (Kraynik et al. 2013).",

This is unlikely because the adrenocortical cells express Epac2 rather than Epac1 (Niimura et al. 2009, Hoivik et al. 2013, see also Fig. 1e), and our Epac2 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals responded fully to ANP (Fig. 4c). Secondly, the ANP effect on microvascular permeability is abolished in mice with endothelial-specific deletion of the GC-A receptor for ANP . Thirdly, our Epac mice had normal blood pressure, arguing that their renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis was unperturbed. The present study supports therefore the notion that ANP may modulate endothelial permeability in vivo through lowering the cAMP concentration near Epac1.",
