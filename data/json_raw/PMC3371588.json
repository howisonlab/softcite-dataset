            "text": "Unusual high-valence states of iron are stabilized in a few oxides. A-site-ordered perovskite-structure oxides contain such iron cations and exhibit distinct electronic behaviors at low temperatures, e.g. charge disproportionation (4Fe 41 R 2Fe 31 1 2Fe 51) in CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and intersite charge transfer (3Cu 21 1 4Fe 3.751 R 3Cu 31 1 4Fe 31) in LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12. Here we report the synthesis of solid solutions of CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and explain how the instabilities of their unusual valence states of iron are relieved. Although these behaviors look completely different from each other in simple ionic models, they can both be explained by the localization of ligand holes, which are produced by the strong hybridization of iron d and oxygen p orbitals in oxides. The localization behavior in the charge disproportionation of CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 is regarded as charge ordering of the ligand holes, and that in the intersite charge transfer of LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 is regarded as a Mott transition of the ligand holes. I ron ions in oxides usually show the 12 and 13 oxidation states typically seen in w\u00fcstite (Fe 21 O) 1,2 , magnetite (Fe 21 Fe 31 2 O 4) 3-5 , and hematite (Fe 31 2 O 3) 6,7. A few oxides, such as SrFeO 3 and CaFeO 3 , contain unusual highoxidation-state iron ions like Fe 41 , and the behaviors of such high-valence iron ions have been attracting much attention for a long time 8-12. The cubic perovskite SrFeO 3 shows a metallic conductivity down to low temperatures because the linear Fe 41-O-Fe 41 bonds stabilize broad conduction bands. CaFeO 3 , on the other hand, has a distorted perovskite structure with a Fe-O-Fe bond angle of <160u 13,14. The unusual oxidation state of the Fe 41 in CaFeO 3 cannot be maintained at low temperatures, and at 290 K its instability is relieved by charge disproportionation (CD): 2Fe 41 R Fe 31 1 Fe 51 11,12. Charge disproportionation is also seen in some perovskiterelated-structure compounds like Sr 3 Fe 2 O 7 and La 12x Ba x FeO 32y , relieving the instability of their unusual valence states of iron 15-18. More than five decades after SrFeO 3 was discovered, a new Fe 41-containing material was found, which has the A-site-ordered double-perovskite structure (see the crystal structure in Fig. 1). CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 is obtained by synthesis under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, and the high-valence Fe 41 is stabilized at room temperature 19. At 210 K the compound shows B-site charge disproportionation (4Fe 41 R 2Fe 31 1 2Fe 51) similar to the charge disproportionation in the simple perovskite CaFeO 3 , and it changes from a high-temperature paramagnetic-and-metallic phase to a low-temperature ferromagnetic-and-insulating phase (a chargedisproportionated phase). High-pressure synthesis techniques can be used to produce the analogous compound LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 , in which La 31 instead of Ca 21 occupies the A site in the A-site-ordered perovskite structure 20. At 393 K LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 shows not the CD behavior seen in CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 but instead exhibits A'-B intersite charge transfer (CT), 3Cu 21 1 4Fe 3.751 R 3Cu 31 1 4Fe 31 , and changes from a high-temperature paramagnetic-andmetallic phase to a low-temperature antiferromagnetic-and-insulating phase (a charge-transferred phase). Thus the instabilities of the unusual oxidation states of iron in these two A-site-ordered perovskites, Fe 41 in CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and Fe 3.751 in LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 , are relieved by completely different ways. To find out how the instabilities of the unusual oxidation states of the transition-metal ions in oxides are relieved, we made solid solution of CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and investigated their temperature-dependent transitions. Results Each solid-solution sample was confirmed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) data (see Supplementary Fig. S1) to be a single phase at high temperatures and to be crystallized with a cubic Im-3 A-site-ordered doubleperovskite structure. Oxygen off-stoichiometry was not detected in the Rietveld structure refinements, and the refined occupancies for Ca and La at the A site were within 2% of those corresponding to the designed"

            "text": "composition Ca 12x La x Cu 3 Fe 4 O 12 (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1 for the refinement results). When changing the A-site composition x the lattice constant at 450 K changes linearly in accordance with Vegard's law ( Fig. 2a). No superlattice reflection was observed in the diffraction patterns, suggesting the absence of any extra ordering in the solid solution. Each M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum at high temperatures showed a paramagnetic singlet component ( Fig. 3), further confirming that each of the samples consisted of a single-phase solid solution. Note that the isomer shift values of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of the paramagnetic states at 400 K gradually increase with increasing x (see Supplementary Fig.  S2), suggesting that the Fe oxidation state decreases slightly. Furthermore, the bond valence sums (BVS) of Fe at 450 K, which are obtained from the structure refinements, gradually decrease with increasing x while those of Cu remain unchanged (Fig. 2b). The results suggest that electrons are doped into the Fe site instead of the Cu site by the La 31 substitution for Ca 21 at the A site. Thus, as we expected from the end compositions, the ionic formula of a solid-solution sample at high temperature can be described as (Ca 21 12x La 31 x )Cu 21 3 Fe (42x/4)1 4 O 12 . For CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 (x 5 0.0) a phase transition at 210 K is evident in the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter (Fig. 2c), and below that temperature very weak superstructure peaks, indicating rock-salt-type B-site ordering, were observed in the synchrotron XRD patterns. The ferrimagnetic transition ( Fig. 4) and the metalto-insulator transition (see Supplementary Fig. S3), together with the change in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra ( Fig. 3a), confirm that the B-site CD occurs at 210 K, as we reported previously 19,21 . In the other end compound LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 (x 5 1.0), a first-order isostructural phase transition takes place at 393 K, as shown by the large increase of the lattice parameter with decreasing temperature (Fig. 2c). At the transition temperature the Fe-O bond length increases significantly whereas the Cu-O bond length decreases, decreasing the BVS for Fe and increasing it for Cu. From the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra shown in Fig. 3b, one can infer that above the transition temperature there is a paramagnetic component of unusual high-valence Fe that has an isomer shift of <0.17 mm s 21 and that at 300 K there is a single component of magnetically ordered Fe 31 . In addition, the compound changes from a high-temperature paramagnetic metal to a low-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator at the phase transition ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus it is concluded that the compound changes from a high-temperature La 31 Cu 21 3 Fe  Supplementary Fig. S4). The large increase in the lattice parameter at 210 K with decreasing temperature indicates the appearance of the CT phase ( Fig. 2c). On the other hand, the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility shows a behavior similar to that shown by CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 , namely a sharp ferrimagnetic increase below <210 K but with a lower magnetization ( Fig. 4) indicative of the CD transition. These are consistent with the M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum at 4 K shown in Fig. 3c, which consists of a pair of Fe 31 /Fe 51 (29.6%/28.5%) components for the charge-disproportionated phase and a magnetic ordered Fe 31 component (41.9%) for the phase due to CT. It is thus clear that below 210 K phases due to CD and CT coexist. When the further La-doped Ca 1/2 La 1/2 Cu 3 Fe 4 O 12 (x 5 1/2) is cooled its lattice parameter increases sharply at 280 K ( Fig. 2c), suggesting the occurrence of CT. Note that at low temperatures its diffraction peaks are rather broad ( Supplementary Fig. S4). In the magnetic susceptibility data, a sharp decrease is found at 280 K, also indicating a CT transition like that in LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 . When the sample was further cooled, a CD-like increase was seen near 210 K, although the magnetization is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 at low temperatures (Fig. 4). The M\u00f6ssbauer spectra change accordingly with decreasing temperature ( Fig. 3d). A single paramagnetic component is seen at high temperatures, and in the spectrum at 228 K a sextet (82%) originating from magnetically ordered Fe 31 is seen in addition to the high-temperature singlet (18%). At 4 K the high-temperature singlet changes to a Fe 31 /Fe 51 sextet pair (refined area of each component: 12.8%/11.9%), confirming that CD occurs in roughly 25% of the sample.",

In the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra a paramagnetic component of high-valence Fe with an isomer shift 0.12 mm s 21 is seen at 400 K, while a single component from magnetically ordered Fe 31 is seen at 4 K, suggesting that most of the sample undergoes a CT transition (Fig. 3e). These CT behaviors are consistent with the observed sharp decrease in the magnetic susceptibility ( Fig. 4) and the large increase in the resistivity below 330 K ( Supplementary Fig. S3). Although a very minor CD-like transition around 210 K is seen in the magnetic susceptibility measurement, the charge-disproportionated phase is not as evident in the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra and the XRD patterns.",

Nevertheless, the electronic phase separation in the samples with the intermediate compositions is clearly seen at low temperatures. For x 5 1/2, for example, the high-temperature phase can be described as ACu 21 3 Fe 3.8751 4 O 12 , and the CT transition at 330 K changes some portion of the sample to ACu 31 3 Fe 31 4 O 12 , leaving the remaining portion of the sample to be a phase with unusually high-valence Fe. In a simple ionic model, this change can be described as ACu 21 3 Fe 3.8751 4 O 12 R 50%ACu 31 3 Fe 31 4 O 12 1 50%ACu 21 3 Fe 41 4 O 12 . Although such an electronic phase-separation behavior seems to be uncommon, we could never observe a transition of the whole sample, such as a CT-like ACu 21 3 Fe Although the observed fractions of the CT and CD phases (75%/25%) determined from the areas of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra measured at 4 K are rather different from the 50%/50% fractions predicted by the simple ionic model, they are reasonably close to the predicted ones. An important point is that the Fe 31 :Fe 51 ratios in the CD phases are always close to 151. Furthermore, none of the T CD of the samples changes with composition x, suggesting that the observed CD transitions are essentially the same in the entire solid solution. The XRD peak broadening seen at low temperatures strongly suggests that the domains of the phases due to CD and CT coexist on a microscopic scale.",

            "text": "Why are the instabilities of these unusual oxidation states of Fe relieved in different ways? And why do we see both the CD and CT transitions in a single-phase sample? As discussed in previous reports on some specific oxides, high-oxidation-state transition-metal ions like Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have very low-lying 3d levels, and the covalent electronic states due to the strong hybridization of 3d and oxygen 2p orbitals produce oxygen p holes (ligand holes) [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35] . Thus, realistic electronic pictures of the unusual Fe 41 , Fe 51 , and Cu 31 states can respectively be described as  5 L R 2d 5 1 2d 5 L 2 ), similar to that in CaFeO 3 . The transition is regarded as a redistribution of the ligand holes in the Fe sites, making the Fe-O bonds alternately shorter and longer in a rocksalt-type manner (Fig. 6a). The rock-salt-type ordering should contribute to minimizing the lattice energy and stabilizing the CD phase. Because at high temperatures the ligand holes are itinerant, as we see in the metallic conductivity, the CD transition in CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 can be regarded as the localization of the ligand holes at the Fe sites, or in other words, as a charge ordering of the ligand holes. In LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 , on the other hand, the CT between the A'-site Cu ions and the B-site Fe ions is mediated by the transfer of ligand holes (3d 9 1 4d 5 L 0.75 R 3d 9 L 1 4d 5 ) from the Fe site to the Cu site (Fig. 6c). This ligand-hole transfer is also linked to the lattice change with the isotropic volume expansion. Since the charge transferred phase is insulating, the intersite CT transition can also be regarded as the localization of the ligand holes at the Cu site. Since the observed metal-to-insulator transition is caused by the localization of an odd number of itinerant ligand holes without breaking the cubic structural symmetry, it can be regarded as a Mott transition of the igand holes. It is clear that the difference between the CD and CT transitions is only the localization site of the ligand holes, so the energy difference between them should not be significant. This also explains why the charge-disproportionated and the charge-transferred phases coexist in the solid solution.",

When temperature decreases, the ligand holes lose kinetic energy and become unstable, resulting in the localization. The instability of the itinerant ligand holes is first relieved by transferring the ligand holes from the Fe site to the Cu site, and the localization at the Cu site produces the d 9 L state. This also explains the change of the T CT in the solid solution. Because the ligand-hole concentration d increases with decreasing x, the high-temperature state with a higher concentration of the itinerant holes is more stable over a wider temperature range and thus the T CT decreases. The Cu 21 counter cation in the A-site-ordered perovskite-structure oxide plays a crucial role in accepting the ligand holes. It is also interesting that the CT transition in the intermediate compositions does not occur in the whole sample but leaves some portion (domains) with itinerant ligand holes at the Fe site, causing an electronic phase separation. With further decreasing temperature, the instability of the remaining itinerant ligand holes is relieved by CD in which the d 5 /d 5 L 2 states are ordered alternately (Fig. 6b). In the higher ligand-hole-concentration region (0.0 # x # 1/4), T CT is lower than (or almost the same as) T CD , and thus the CT is not observed.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the unusual high-valence Fe ions are stabilized in the high-pressure synthesized A-site-ordered perovskite-structure Ca 12x La x Cu 3 Fe 4 O 12 solid-solution samples, and the end-composition compounds CaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 and LaCu 3 Fe 4 O 12 display distinct charge behaviors, respectively charge disproportionation (CD) and intersite charge transfer (CT). Compounds with intermediate compositions first show intersite CT transition in part of the sample and then show CD in the rest of the sample. In this system, d orbitals of Fe at the B site and Cu at the A' site strongly hybridize with p orbitals of oxygen, producing ligand holes, and the distinct charge behaviors can be explained by the localization of the itinerant ligand holes at low temperatures. In the charge-disproportionated phase the ligand holes are localized at the Fe site and the transition is regarded as one to the rock-salt-type charge ordering of the ligand holes. The CD transition is essentially the same in all solid-solution samples, so the T CD is same regardless of their La content. In the intersite CT, on the other hand, the ligand holes are localized at the Cu site and the transition can be regarded as a Mott transition of the ligand holes. T CT decreases with increasing concentration of the ligand-hole carriers. In the A-site-ordered perovskite-structure oxides, transitionmetals at both A' and B sites mediate A'-A', A'-B, and B-B interactions that lead to intriguing physical properties [36][37][38][39][40][41] . The ligand holes produced by the strong hybridization of transition-metal cation d orbitals and oxygen p orbitals also play important roles in giving rise to various electronic and structural properties. The present A-siteordered perovskite-structure Ca 12x La x Cu 3 Fe 4 O 12 solid solution is a novel example exhibiting interplay of the interactions mediated by the ligand holes.",

Synchrotron XRD patterns at temperatures between 100 and 450 K were collected at beamline BL02B2, SPring-8, Japan, with wavelength 0.7737405 \u00c5 , and the profiles were analyzed with Rietveld method by using the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS) software package 42,43 . The XRD patterns at temperatures between 80 and 400 K were also collected using a Rigaku RINT diffractometer with a Mo and a Cu source. Magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and electric conductivity were measured using a Quantum Design Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) and Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). The 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectra were obtained in transmission geometry in combination with a constant-acceleration spectrometer using 57 Co/Rh as a radiation source. a-Fe was used as a control for velocity calibration and isomer shift. The obtained spectra were fitted by a least-squares method with Lorentzian functions. ",
