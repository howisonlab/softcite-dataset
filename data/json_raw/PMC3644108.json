            "text": "Physicists have long wondered whether the gravitational interactions between matter and antimatter might be different from those between matter and itself. Although there are many indirect indications that no such differences exist and that the weak equivalence principle holds, there have been no direct, free-fall style, experimental tests of gravity on antimatter. Here we describe a novel direct test methodology; we search for a propensity for antihydrogen atoms to fall downward when released from the ALPHA antihydrogen trap. In the absence of systematic errors, we can reject ratios of the gravitational to inertial mass of antihydrogen 475 at a statistical significance level of 5%; worst-case systematic errors increase the minimum rejection ratio to 110. A similar search places somewhat tighter bounds on a negative gravitational mass, that is, on antigravity. This methodology, coupled with ongoing experimental improvements, should allow us to bound the ratio within the more interesting near equivalence regime.",

            "text": "here are many compelling experimental and theoretical arguments 1-10 that suggest that the gravitational mass of antimatter cannot differ from the gravitational or inertial mass of normal matter, that is, that the weak equivalence principle holds. For instance, one such argument comes from the absence of anomalies in E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiments conducted with differing atoms 4 ; the differing number of virtual particleantiparticle pairs in such atoms might have caused gravitational anomalies to occur. However, all of these arguments are indirect and are not universally accepted [11][12][13][14] ; they rely on assumptions about the gravitational interactions of virtual antimatter, on postulates such as CPT invariance, or on other theoretical premises. Although these arguments may well be correct, in a world in which physicists have only recently discovered that we cannot account for most of the matter and energy in the universe, it would be presumptuous to categorically assert that the gravitational mass of antimatter necessarily equals its inertial mass. Moreover, the baryogenesis problem suggests that our understanding of antimatter is incomplete; gravitational asymmetries have been proposed as an explanation 7,15,16 . (Note that ref. 7 ultimately rejected gravity as a solution to the baryogenesis problem because of a thermodynamic proof of the weak equivalence principle. This proof was later challenged 10 .)",

Our results set statistical bounds on the value of FM g /M, the ratio of the gravitational mass M g to the inertial mass M of antihydrogen. (M is assumed numerically equal to the mass of hydrogen.) In the absence of systematic errors, we find that F must be o75 at a statistical significance level of 5%; worst-case systematic errors increase this limit to Fo110. A similar search places somewhat tighter bounds on a negative F, that is, on antigravity. Refinements of our technique, coupled with larger numbers of cold-trapped antiatoms, should allow us to bound F more tightly in future experiments and approach the |F|E1 regime of widespread interest.",

The trapping potential depth, which was originally B540 mK at t \u00bc 0 ms, is reduced to B11 mK in the radial direction at t \u00bc 20 ms. (Here we use kelvin as an energy unit.) Note that the 1 T solenoidal field, which is oriented parallel to the trap axis (the\u1e91 direction), is never varied. The well depth, which is proportional to the change in the magnitude of the total magnetic field as one progresses outwards from the trap centre, diminishes more slowly (B80 mK at 20 ms) in the axial\u1e91 direction than in the radial direction. This is because the\u1e91-directed mirror fields add linearly to the solenoidal field, while thex-and\u0177-directed octupole fields add in quadrature to this field. Consequently, almost all of our trapped antihydrogen escapes radially 31 .",

However, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the escape time of an anti-atom and its initial energy because it can take some time for an anti-atom to find the 'hole' in the trap potential. Computer simulations of this process, described in ref. 38, show that anti-atoms of a given initial energy escape over a temporal range of at least 10 ms.

To model the experiment, we simulated the effects of gravity on an ensemble of ground-state antihydrogen atoms randomly selected from the ffiffi e p energy distribution described above. These anti-atoms are first propagated for 50 ms in the full-strength trap fields to effectively randomize their positions, and then propagated in the post-shutdown decaying fields until they annihilate on the trap wall. The results of a typical simulation are shown in Fig. 2 for F \u00bc 100, which exaggerates the effects of gravity relative to the baseline of F \u00bc 1 expected from the equivalence principle. As can be seen in Fig. 2, there is a tendency for the anti-atoms to annihilate in the bottom half (yo0) of the trap. This tendency is pronounced for anti-atoms annihilating at later times. This is because, as shown in Fig. 3 and in Table 1, the confining potential well associated with the magnetic and gravitational forces in equation 1 is most skewed by gravitational effects late in time when the magnetic restoring force is relatively weak, and the remaining particles are those with the lowest energy. We note that while the number of late annihilating anti-atoms is dependent on the exact energy distribution used to initialize the simulations, the annihilation locations of these anti-atoms are not; for the purposes of this paper, the exact distribution is unimportant.",

To determine an experimental limit on F, we compare our data set of 434 observed antihydrogen annihilation events to computer simulations at various F's. Our statistics suffer from the fact that escaping antiatoms are most sensitive to gravitational forces at late times, but relatively few of the events occur at late times. For example, even with the cooling due to the adiabatic expansion that occurs as the trap depth is lowered, only 23 anti-atoms out of the 434 annihilate after 20 ms. Moreover, inspection of the simulation data in Fig. 2 shows that even when there is a pronounced tendency for the anti-atoms to fall down, some still annihilate near the top of the trap. To obtain a qualitative understanding of the data, we use the reverse cumulative average /y|tS: the average of the y positions of all the annihilations that occur at time t or later (see Methods). This reverse cumulative average highlights the more informative late-time events while still including as many events as possible into the average. Figure 4 plots /y|tS for the events and the simulations at several values of F. These plots suggest that an upper bound on F can be established from the data, at a value somewhere between F \u00bc 60 and 150.",

(In this paper, the phrase 'pseudo-annihilations' or 'pseudo-events' always refers to simulation results. The unqualified word 'events' always refers to experimental results.) We make this determination with a Monte Carlo analysis based on an overall test statistic, that is, a figure-of-merit, F, which is sensitive to discrepancies between the real and simulated data. Our choice of F is closely related to a Fisher's combined test 40 based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) 41 statistics. The exact definition of F is described in the Methods section. In brief, for every F, we calculate the test statistic F Ev for the experimental events. This F Ev compares {(y,t)} Ev to a reference distribution compiled from a third (B300,000 simulated annihilations) of the simulation data set {(y,t)} F . The test statistic F is small when it is likely that the 434 events could have been drawn from the reference distribution, and large when it is unlikely that the events could have been so drawn, that is, when there is a significant disparity between the distribution of the actual events and the reference distribution of the simulated annihilations at the hypothesized F. Next, to approximate the sampling distribution for F, we distribute the remaining pseudo-annihilations in {(y,t)} F into N pseudo-event subsets of 434 points. In total there are about 900,000 pseudo-events in {(y,t)} F , so N is about 1,400. Each of these pseudo-event sets is representative of what we would have observed if the ratio of the inertial to the gravitational mass really was F. Then, we calculate the set of test statistics {F i;F } for each of these pseudo-event sets, and count the number N 4 for which F i;F ZF Ev , that is, the number of pseudo-event sets that are less compatible with the reference distribution than the actual events. From N 4 , we obtain a Monte Carlo estimate of the overall Pvalue, P \u00bc N 4 /N, for the goodness-of-fit test on the actual data set compared with the simulations. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 5, from which we conclude that F475 is excluded at a significance level of 5%.",

The 'Gap' polarization potential energy is the energy gained entering the gap between the electrodes, and the 'Patch' potential energy is the energy gained approaching a typical patch field region on the electrodes 17 . the 0.75-mm gap between the electrodes. These fields are on the order of 10 V mm \u00c0 1 . The energy that a ground-state antihydrogen atom would acquire approaching this gap is about five orders of magnitude less than the F \u00bc 1 gravitational potential drop across the trap diameter. Furthermore, such a high field exists only in a very small volume of the trap. The 'patch' fields 17 that plague charged particle gravity tests perturb the anti-atom energy by about two orders of magnitude less than the bias electric fields. The annihilation detection algorithm determines the locations of the anti-atom annihilations from the tracks of the pions that result from each annihilation. The smearing that results from the limited spatial resolution of the detector is well characterized 37 and is incorporated into our analysis (see Methods). The largest uncertainty in limiting F comes from our neglect, up to this point, of systematic effects from mechanical misalignments and from magnetic field errors. For example, the detector might not be perfectly centred on the trap axis. This misalignment is limited by mechanical constraints to be no more than \u00b1 5 mm. Such a misalignment would cause an apparent shift in the annihilation locations at early times as well as late, resulting in a bias in the average of the entire event set, /y|t \u00bc 0S, of \u00b12.5 mm if at the constraint limit. (These errors differ from the detector smearing errors, which were calculated assuming that the detector was perfectly centred.) A somewhat smaller error would result from the octupole axis being displaced from the trap axis, which would cause a shift in the real annihilation locations. Like the detector displacement error, this displacement would cause a bias in overall average /y|t \u00bc 0S. A bias of unknown origin is indeed visible in the event data: /y|t \u00bc 0S \u00bc \u00c0 1.3 \u00b1 0.8 mm. Simulations incorporating an octupole axis displacement show that this overall bias would correspond to a\u0177 axis displacement of only \u00c0 0.06 mm. Perhaps coincidentally, this is nearly identical to the maximum displacement allowed by mechanical constraints. We have performed a broad survey (see Supplementary Note 1) of other magnetic field errors consistent with the mechanical tolerances of our device. This survey shows that the largest biases that could result from magnetic errors are usually smaller than, and at worst comparable to, the largest bias possible from an octupole axis displacement. Thus, in the absence of fortuitous cancelations, the relatively small measured bias in /y|t \u00bc 0S limits the size of the effects of these errors at the late times when the experiment is most sensitive to gravity. Taking the maximally allowed detector and octupole displacement errors as representative of the worstcase systematic errors, we have modelled their effects in the statistical calculations and, as shown in Fig. 5, determined that the worst-case exclusion region is F4110, still at a significance level of 5%. Similarly, analysis of favourable systematic errors, say because of a fortuitous octupole axis displacement of \u00c0 0.05 mm that would eliminate the /y|t \u00bc 0S bias, yields a best case exclusion of F465 based on statistics alone.",

In an observed sample of over 270,000 of such anti-atoms, the y mean was \u00fe 0.86 \u00b1 0.03 mm. However, the orbital dynamics of untrapped antihydrogen and antiprotons are quite different from the dynamics of trapped antihydrogen, and there are effects that can lead to average vertical displacements of the opposite sign. A Monte Carlo simulation of our detector, which includes the effects of dead regions, gives a mean value for y of \u00fe 0.01\u00b10.06 mm. A hitherto unutilized experimental sample of 120 trapped antihydrogen atoms had a y mean of \u00fe 2.2\u00b11.4 mm. (This sample was not otherwise utilized because the atoms in this sample could not be guaranteed to have been trapped for more than 400 ms. Hence, these atoms were not necessarily in the ground state 31 .) These means do not entirely reconcile with each other or with the y mean of the standard sample of trapped atoms ( \u00c0 1.3 \u00b1 0.8 mm), and we have no certain explanation of their differences. However, the range of means predicted by our analysis of the detector axis displacements encompasses all these values; thus, we allow for larger errors in our worst-case analysis.",

On the basis of goodness-of-fit tests comparing the positions of actual and simulated annihilation events, we can rule out ratios above F \u00bc 75 (statistics alone) and F \u00bc 110 (including worst-case systematic effects) for gravity, and below F \u00bc \u00c0 65 (combined systematic and statistical effects) for antigravity, at the 5% significance level. Obviously, our limits are far from the F \u00bc 1 regime where one could test for small deviations from the weak equivalence principle, but the methodology described here, coupled with planned and ongoing improvements to the ALPHA apparatus, should allow us to improve the measurement substantially. Simulations show that by cooling the anti-atoms, perhaps with lasers, to 30 mK or lower, and by lengthening the magnetic shutdown time constant to 300 ms, we would have the statistical power to measure gravity to the F \u00bc \u00b1 1 level (see Fig. 6). Cooling obviously increases the relative influence of gravity on the anti-atom trajectories. The longer shutdown times are necessary to take full advantage of adiabatic expansion cooling of these slower anti-atoms. They also allow the anti-atoms to find and annihilate on the portions of the trap wall where the trapping well depth is lowest. Systematic errors pose a significant challenge for low F measurements, however, and will need to be addressed. In summary, our experiments are an important first step towards a precise gravitational measurement with trapped, neutral antimatter. The current work clearly demonstrates the potential for using a carefully prepared, well-characterized sample of trapped antihydrogen atoms as a source for direct, ballistic studies of the gravitational behaviour of antimatter. The use of untrapped neutral antimatter for gravitational measurements, as pursued by other groups 27,28 , is, as yet, unproven.",

            "text": "Antihydrogen energy distribution. To model the behaviour of anti-atoms during the magnet shutdown, we need to know the initial antihydrogen velocity distribution. ALPHA synthesizes antihydrogen atoms by injecting antiprotons into a positron plasma. The positron plasma is typically at a temperature of B40 K (ref. 30); before antihydrogen forms, the antiprotons thermalize on the positrons, giving them a temperature that approaches 40 K ref. 47. The resultant antihydrogen inherits the centre-of-mass kinetic energy of the antiprotons from which they are formed, so it too has an initial temperature of about 40 K. Most of these antihydrogen atoms are far too energetic to be trapped; only those with an energy near or below the trapping depth of 540 mK are sufficiently cold to be trapped. These trapped anti-atoms are deep within the Maxwellian distribution, where the energy distribution scales like ffiffi e p de. Strong evidence that the true energy distribution is close to this comes from comparing the annihilation times of the actual anti-atoms with the annihilation times of simulated anti-atoms for several different distributions (see Fig. 7a). This comparison is shown in Fig. 7b, where it is clear that the Maxwellian distribution best fits the experimental events. However, there are some differences between the two; for example, the simulations slightly underpredict the number of late annihilating anti-atoms. Fortunately, the analysis is not very sensitive to the details of the distribution, so the small deviations from Maxwellian visible in Fig. 7b are unimportant. For instance, Fig. 7c shows the annihilation locations for anti-atoms that annihilate between 20 and 22 ms, and the differences between the three distributions plotted are barely discernible. Figure 7d shows the influence of the choice of distribution on the reverse cumulative average /y|tS, and the differences are also small.",

In Fig. 4, /y|tS is shown for both the event data and the simulation data at the given F's.

Then, at every t, /y|tS is calculated for each subset and the results ordered. The error band at every t is then defined by the 5 and 95% quantiles of the ordered /y|tS. Detector resolution. The detector determines the locations of the anti-atom annihilations by triangulation of the pion tracks produced by each annihilation.

The K-S test, described in the next paragraph, indicates how compatible the y annihilation distribution of a specific trial data set, windowed between t and 30 ms, is with the y annihilation distribution of a similarly windowed reference data set. Specifically, at every F we extract a B300,000 point subset from the simulation data to serve as a reference data set. Then we compute P KS (t;F) at every start time t and integrate using a numerical quadrature rule with a fixed time increment of 0.3 ms. Carrying out this procedure using the event data set for the trial distribution, we get the F Ev defined earlier. Carrying out this identical procedure using the remaining NE1,400 pseudo-event sets as the trial distributions, we get the set {F i;F }. Under the null hypothesis, namely, that there is no difference between the distributions for a given F, the P KS (t;F) themselves should be uniformly distributed. As originally introduced, Fisher's combined test statistic was intended for independent tests, for which the overall P-value is w 2 distributed. In our case, the K-S P-values are correlated in t because the t windows overlap, so the P-value of the combined test statistic is estimated by Monte Carlo sampling.

A greater distance reflects a lower probability that samples drawn from the reference set could deviate from the 'average' of that set by more than the trial set. These distances translate to approximate K-S P-values, P KS (t;F), through a well-studied universal function 49,50 . As our reference CDFs are rigorously stochastically ordered, yielding strictly declining P KS (t;F) for increasing F (t held fixed) once P is small, we can employ a one-sided K-S test rather than the more typical two-sided test. When the number of samples between t and 30 ms in the trial set, k is greater than 4, we use the standard asymptotic expansion 49 for the distance to P KS function; for smaller k we use the direct small-sample formulae. The P KS for small k are generally close to unity, and contribute little to F. The estimated P KS include 'two-sample' corrections to account for the sampling error in the reference CDFs; however, these corrections are very small because the simulation sample sizes are large. Any approximations involved in calculating the P KS do not greatly affect the overall P-value, as the former are not interpreted directly in terms of Type I (false positive) errors, but are only used to compute the combined test statistic F whose P-value is determined by Monte Carlo methods.",

            "text": "This retrospective analysis was based on data collected in 2010 and 2011 by the entire ALPHA collaboration, using the antihydrogen trapping apparatus and methods developed by the collaboration. The gravity analysis described here was proposed and first carried out by J.F. and J.S.W. The analysis employed computer simulations developed by J.F.; the results of these simulations were checked with independent simulations developed by F.R. The statistical techniques were refined by A.E.C., and the final implementation of these techniques was carried out by A.Z. E.B., A.O. and F.R. proposed alternative statistical treatments that yielded similar results. This article was written by J.F. and J.S.W., with help from A.E.C., M.C., J.S.H. and A.Z., and then improved and approved by all the authors. ",
