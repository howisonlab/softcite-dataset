            "text": "Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2), which constitutes \ue07a1% of the plasma membrane phospholipid, plays a key role in membrane-delimited signaling. PIP 2 regulates structurally and functionally diverse membrane proteins, including voltage-and ligand-gated ion channels, inwardly rectifying ion channels, transporters, and receptors. In some cases, the regulation is known to involve specific lipid-protein interactions, but the mechanisms by which PIP 2 regulates many of its various targets remain to be fully elucidated. Because many PIP 2 targets are membrane-spanning proteins, we explored whether the phosphoinositides might alter bilayer physical properties such as curvature and elasticity, which would alter the equilibrium between membrane protein conformational states-and thereby protein function. Taking advantage of the gramicidin A (gA) channels' sensitivity to changes in lipid bilayer properties, we used gA-based fluorescence quenching and single-channel assays to examine the effects of long-chain PIP 2 s (brain PIP 2 , which is predominantly 1-stearyl-2-arachidonyl-PIP 2 , and dioleoyl-PIP 2) on bilayer properties. When premixed with dioleoyl-phosphocholine at 2 mol %, both long-chain PIP 2 s produced similar changes in gA channel function (bilayer properties); when applied through the aqueous solution, however, brain PIP 2 was a more potent modifier than dioleoyl-PIP 2. Given the widespread use of short-chain dioctanoylphosphoinositides, we also examined the effects of diC 8-phosphoinositol (PI), PI(4,5)P 2 , PI(3,5)P 2 , PI(3,4)P 2 , and PI(3,4,5)P 3. The diC 8 phosphoinositides, except for PI(3,5)P 2 , altered bilayer properties with potencies that decreased with increasing head group charge. Nonphosphoinositide diC 8 phospholipids generally were more potent bilayer modifiers than the polyphosphoinositides. These results show that physiological increases or decreases in plasma membrane PIP 2 levels, as a result of activation of PI kinases or phosphatases, are likely to alter lipid bilayer properties, in addition to any other effects they may have. The results further show that exogenous PIP 2 , as well as structural analogues that differ in acyl chain length or phosphorylation state, alters lipid bilayer properties at the concentrations used in many cell physiological experiments .",

This regulation may result from phosphoinositide binding to the target protein, and several specific phosphoinositide-binding domains have been identified. Specific binding mainly (but not exclusively; Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007) involves the interaction of positively charged residues with the negatively charged phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) phosphates (McLaughlin and Murray, 2005;Hurley, 2006;Suh and Hille, 2008;Hansen et al., 2011;Leonard and Hurley, 2011;Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011). In many cases, the regulation seems to be more general, however, in the sense that other anionic phospholipids can substitute for the phosphoinositides (Fan and Makielski, 1997;Kim and Bang, 1999;Hilgemann et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2003;Vaithianathan et al., 2008), suggesting that the regulation involves less specific electrostatic interactions with a positively charged region-but Correspondence to Radda Rusinova: r a r 2 0 2 1 @ m e d . c o r n e l l . e d u Abbreviations used in this paper: ANTS, 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6trisulfonate; CMC, critical micelle concentration; gA, gramicidin A; LUV, large unilamellar vesicle. leaving open the question of how the phosphoinositides alter function.",

In this context, it is important that PIP 2 has \ue07a50% polyunsaturated fatty acids (Marsh, 2012b), which would tend to reduce the bilayer bending modulus (Rawicz et al., 2000;Bruno et al., 2013). PIP 2 constitutes \ue07a1% of total cell lipid, varying among different cell types (Ferrell and Huestis, 1984;Nasuhoglu et al., 2002;Wenk et al., 2003;Xu et al., 2003;Horowitz et al., 2005;Li et al., 2005;Hilgemann, 2007). Because the total cell lipid profile includes intracellular membranes, and PIP 2 is localized predominantly to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Balla and V\u00e1rnai, 2002), the area-averaged mole percentage of PIP 2 in the plasma membrane is likely to be >1% (Hilgemann, analogues alter bilayer properties and, if so, to parse out which bilayer properties are affected.",

For the present studies, we used gramicidin A (gA) channels as probes that serve as prototypical bilayer-spanning proteins, which experience minimal interference from specific lipid-protein interactions. gA channels form by the transmembrane dimerization of nonconducting monomeric subunits residing in apposing bilayer leaflets (O'Connell et al., 1990). Channel formation is associated with a local bilayer compression (Elliott et al., 1983;Huang, 1986;Harroun et al., 1999), which makes gA channels sensitive to changes in bilayer properties Lundbaek et al., 2010a,b).",

The diC 8 phospholipid stock solutions were 5 mM in water, except for the diC 8 PE stock solution, which was 5 mM in ethanol (Pharmco-AAPER). The long-chain PIP 2 s were 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1\ue039-myo-inositol-4\ue039,5\ue039-bisphosphate) and the porcine brain extract of PIP 2 , which is \ue07a80% C 18/20:4 PIP 2 . To make aqueous \"solutions\" of diC 18:1 and brain PIP 2 , the powder was suspended in H 2 O. The suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic homogenizer (model 300 V/T; Biologics Inc.) for 30 min on ice at 90% power and 90% duty cycle using 1-s pulses. The resuspended long-chain phosphoinositides were flash frozen and stored at \ue03240\u00b0C in a glass vial. To make DC 18:1 PC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine)/ PIP 2 lipid mixtures, the long-chain PIP 2 was dissolved in chloroform (Honeywell Burdick and Jackson) and mixed with DC 18:1 PC in chloroform at the appropriate mole percentage. Chloroform was evaporated under N 2 , and the mixture was suspended in n-decane (Sigma-Aldrich). 8-Aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) was purchased from Invitrogen. For the single-channel experiments, we used a 15-amino acid analogue, [Ala 1 ]gA (AgA(15)), a chain-shortened 13-amino acid gA analogue of opposite helix sense, des-d-Val-Gly-gA \ue032 (gA \ue032 (13)), and a 15-amino acid analogue in which the NH groups on the four Trp residues are methylated, [Val 1 ,11,13,15 ]gA (N-Me-gA(15)); they were synthesized and purified as described previously (Greathouse et al., 1999). For the fluorescence assay, we used the natural mixture of gramicidins 2007)-and local PIP 2 concentrations may be even higher (Wang and Richards, 2012). Given the lack of a clear mechanism for many of the PIP 2 -mediated effects, it thus becomes important to explore whether changes in extant, or exogenously applied, PIP 2 s alter bilayer properties at relevant concentrations, in which case some of PIP 2 's effects may be caused by nonspecific bilayer-mediated mechanisms, as recently was proposed in the case of invertebrate phototransduction (Hardie and Franze, 2012).",

(It is given that \ue044G def will change, but the changes may or may not be sufficient to cause measurable changes in protein function.) We therefore set out to determine whether PIP 2 and its structural analogues alter bilayer properties and, if so, to parse out which bilayer properties are affected. Many different probes have been used to characterize the changes in bilayer properties that are caused by drugs and other amphiphiles (Seddon et al., 2009). For the present studies, we used gramicidin A (gA) channels as probes that serve as prototypical bilayer-spanning proteins, which experience minimal interference from specific lipid-protein interactions. gA channels form by the transmembrane dimerization of nonconducting monomeric subunits residing in apposing bilayer leaflets (O'Connell et al., 1990). Channel formation is associated with a local bilayer compression (Elliott et al., 1983;Huang, 1986;Harroun et al., 1999), which makes gA channels sensitive to changes in bilayer properties Lundbaek et al., 2010a,b).",

The suspension was sonicated in an ultrasonic homogenizer (model 300 V/T; Biologics Inc.) for 30 min on ice at 90% power and 90% duty cycle using 1-s pulses. The resuspended long-chain phosphoinositides were flash frozen and stored at \ue03240\u00b0C in a glass vial. To make DC 18:1 PC (1,2-dioleoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine)/PIP 2 lipid mixtures, the long-chain PIP 2 was dissolved in chloroform (Honeywell Burdick and Jackson) and mixed with DC 18:1 PC in chloroform at the appropriate mole percentage. Chloroform was evaporated under N 2 , and the percentage of PIP 2 in the plasma membrane is likely to be >1% (Hilgemann, 2007)-and local PIP 2 concentrations may be even higher (Wang and Richards, 2012). Given the lack of a clear mechanism for many of the PIP 2 -mediated effects, it thus becomes important to explore whether changes in extant, or exogenously applied, PIP 2 s alter bilayer properties at relevant concentrations, in which case some of PIP 2 's effects may be caused by nonspecific bilayer-mediated mechanisms, as recently was proposed in the case of invertebrate phototransduction (Hardie and Franze, 2012).",

In brief, after solvent evaporation, DC 22:1 PC (1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphocholine) was rehydrated in 100 mM NaNO 3 , 25 mM ANTS, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7. After vesicle extrusion and desalting to remove excess ANTS, the ANTS-loaded LUVs were prepared for fluorescent experiments by diluting 1:20 in 140 mM NaNO 3 and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7. ANTS-loaded LUVs were doped with gD; after incubation for 24 h at 12.5\u00b0C to allow for bilayer incorporation of gD, the LUVs were incubated at 25\u00b0C with or without (control) the test phospholipid for 10 min (unless otherwise noted). The LUVs and the Tl + -containing quench buffer were mixed in a stopped-flow spectrometer (SX.20; Applied Photophysics) with a dead time of <2 ms, and the time course of the ANTS fluorescence signal was recorded (see Figs. 8 A and 9 A). The resulting fluorescence quench curves were fit with a stretched exponential (Berberan-Santos et al., 2005) in Figs. 8 B and 9 B to acting to dissociate the dimer. Changes in bilayer physical properties will alter the phenomenological elastic coefficients and thus \ue044G def , f, and \ue074 (Lundbaek et al., 2010b;Greisen et al., 2011), which make the gA channels suitable as probes of changes in bilayer properties.",

Overall, the potency decreased with increasing head group charge (compare with Fig. 1), as would be expected if the short-chain phosphoinositides' bilayer-modifying potencies depended on their ability to partition into the bilayer-solution interface. Though the formal charge on PI(3,5)P 2 is the same as that on PI(4,5)P 2 and PI(3,4)P 2 , its bilayer-modifying potency was less than that of PI(3,4,5)P 3 , suggesting that the phosphate configuration around the inositol ring modulates the interaction with the bilayer. Unlike the adjacent phosphates in PI(3,4)P 2 or PI(4,5)P 2 , the distant phosphates in PI(3,5)P 2 may prevent the phosphoinositol ring from inserting as far into the bilayer (Redfern and Gericke, 2005), resulting in weaker bilayer effects.",

(2011) using 1.2/CMC as an estimate for the (dimensionless) partition coefficient into the membrane (Bullock and Cohen, 1986); the total phospholipid concentration in the membrane was taken to be 1.2 M. This may overestimate the partition coefficient and mole % PL , as Heerklotz and Seelig (2000) found the partition coefficient for diC 7 PC to be threefold less than predicted using the above estimator. (The difference between the mole fractions in the LUVs vs. the planar bilayer is a result of the different amount of lipids in the different systems.)",

In contrast, phosphoinositides act through direct binding to their membrane protein effectors, as opposed to altering lipid bilayer properties or some other indirect mechanism that in turn will alter the energetics of protein conformational transitions.

Some ion channels are regulated at very low PIP 2 concentrations, whereas other PIP 2 targets require higher concentrations, as reflected in their regulation by physiological stimulation of PIP 2 hydrolysis (Huang et al., 1998;Kobrinsky et al., 2000;Runnels et al., 2002;Lopes et al., 2002;Zhang et al., 2003;Roh\u00e1cs et al., 2005;Roh\u00e1cs, 2007). In the case of Kir channels, the PIP 2 affinity is inversely correlated with the channels' susceptibility to regulation by PIP 2 isomers and other molecules (Zhang et al., 1999;Schulze et al., 2003;Lee et al., 2005;Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007). Thus, channels with lower affinity for PIP 2 are likely to be more sensitive to their environment, in which case dynamic changes in the environment (including PIP 2 -induced changes in bilayer properties) may be important for function. These features may be tested by exposing the channels to short-chain nonphosphoinositide phospholipids, which modify the bilayer (Fig. 11 C) and thus allow for a positive control of sensitivity to changes in lipid bilayer properties.",

Other than requirements for positive and aromatic residues, the binding sites are not clearly defined (Rosenhouse-Dantsker and Logothetis, 2007;Suh and Hille, 2008), however, and mutations of specific residues, or even entire polybasic regions, may modulate but not eliminate the PIP 2 effects (Roh\u00e1cs et al., 2003;Zhang et al., 2003;Roh\u00e1cs, 2007;Vaithianathan et al., 2008). These ambiguities suggest that some PIP 2 effects may be the result of less specific interactions, such as altered energetic coupling between the target protein and the host bilayer. Indeed, nonphosphoinositide phospholipids can alter channel function if applied at high concentrations from 0.01 to 1 mM (Fan and Makielski, 1997;Kim and Bang, 1999;Hilgemann et al., 2001;Zhang et al., 2003;Vaithianathan et al., 2008). Importantly, the PIP 2 abundance percentage in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is on the order of 1%, perhaps higher (Ferrell and Huestis, 1984;Balla and V\u00e1rnai, 2002;Nasuhoglu et al., 2002;Wenk et al., 2003;Xu et al., 2003;Horowitz et al., Figure 10.

Normalized changes in quench rates produced by the diC 8 phospholipids (means \u00b1 SD; n = 3-5). Data for diC 8 PI (gray line) from bilayer-modifying potency (Lundbaek et al., 1997; see also Lundbaek and Andersen, 1994;Bruno et al., 2013). In the case of the polyphosphoinositides, the decreased potencies, relative to diC 8 PI (compare Fig. 9 with Fig. 10), may be the result of a dominant effect of the chargedependent decrease in the partition coefficient.",

In any case, although the head group charges make it challenging to estimate the mole fractions of PI, PIP 2 , and PIP 3 in the bilayer (they preclude using clogP for the estimate), the decreasing bilayer-modifying potency with increasing charge on the molecules available to partition into the bilayer (see last paragraph of Discussion); and the ability of a molecule in the bilayer to alter bilayer properties. The apparent potencies of the short-chain phosphoinositides decrease with increasing charge, consistent with the expected influence of charge to lower the partition coefficient into lipid bilayers (Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993). In the LUV experiments, the short-chain nonphosphoinositide phospholipids and diC 8 PI have similar potencies. The similar effects of the charged and zwitterionic phospholipids could be caused by the combined effect of a decreased partition coefficient (Marsh and King, 1986;Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993;Marsh, 2012a) and a larger effective head group size (Israelachvili et al., 1980;Kleinschmidt and Tamm, 2002) for the charged phospholipids. Thus, molecule per molecule, the charged phospholipids would be expected to have increased values are calculated from the changes in \ue074 and f as described in Materials and methods (Eq. 6).

The 95% confidence intervals (green lines) indicate that the slope is significantly different from 1.0 (dashed line), indicating that both of the short-chain phospholipids produce relatively larger increases in the lifetimes of the gA \ue032 (13) channels as compared with the gA(15) channels.",

The different rank-order potencies in the LUVs and planar bilayers, as well as the differences observed for shortchain phospholipids described here and long-chain lysophospholipids from a previous study (Lundbaek and Andersen, 1994), reflect the compounds' detailed molecular properties, including the effective cross-sectional areas of the acyl chains relative to the head groups-as well as the lengths of their acyl chains relative to those of the bilayer-forming lipids in the host bilayer (Aagaard et al., 2006;. , in particular, found that the sign of the effect of an n-alkyl alcohol on lipid bilayer properties varied with the n-alkyl length (short-chain alcohols increased gA channel dimerization; long-chain alcohols decreased dimerization). The chain length at which the transition occurred furthermore varied with the host bilayer phospholipid acyl chain length.

The key difference we observed was with the long-chain PIP 2 s. When added through the aqueous solution, brain PIP 2 altered bilayer properties, whereas diC 18:1 PIP 2 did not-and diC 18:1 PIP 2 remained inactive after prolonged (30 min) incubation. This difference may be important for the design and interpretation of experiments in biological membranes. To gain further insight into these observations, we attempted to determine the partition coefficients of the long-chain PIP 2 s by separating LUV-partitioned PIP 2 from micellar PIP 2 using ultracentrifugation and assessing the PIP 2 concentrations by phosphorus assay (Chen et al., 1956). The density of PIP 2 micelles, however, allows them to sediment with LUVs (unpublished data), precluding separation of LUVs from PIP 2 micelles by centrifugation.",

Both long-and short-chain PIP 2 s produce modest relative changes in f and \ue074. Even when comparing the lifetime changes observed with the gA -(13) and AgA(15) channels (Figs. 7 D and 11 D), we cannot unambiguously distinguish between PIP 2 effects on curvature and elasticity. Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extent the electrostatic interactions among the PIP 2 head groups, which would tend to increase the effective head group size (Kleinschmidt and Tamm, 2002), would influence the intrinsic curvature (Lundbaek et al., 1997) and maybe also the head group hydration. Importantly, the PIP 2 s had no effect on the gA single-channel current amplitudes, indicating that their mole percentage in the first lipid shell around the channel was low (compare the contrasting results obtained with other anionic compounds; Lundbaek et al., 1997;Bruno et al., 2007).

The results, nevertheless, do not rule out further effects of lipid curvature (Lundbaek et al., 2010a,b). section). The apparent differences in bilayer partitioning of the diC 18:1 and brain PIP 2 analogues in our assays also may manifest themselves in cell physiological studies, as apparent differences in potency that may not, in fact, have a functional basis.",

            "text": "Both long-and short-chain phosphoinositides are bilayermodifying molecules in that they can alter their target protein function by a combination of direct (protein binding) and indirect (bilayer mediated) effects. The changes in bilayer properties occur at physiologically relevant concentrations (mole percentage of membrane lipids), in the case of the long-chain PIP 2 s, and at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, in the case of shortchain compounds. It thus becomes important to consider the changes in membrane properties resulting from local PIP 2 depletion or enrichment, which may be a contributing mechanism through which PIP 2 alters protein function. Our results suggest a strategy for identifying, or excluding, such nonspecific bilayer effects. Effects at low micromolar concentrations of (long or short chain) PIP 2 s are likely to reflect specific interactions with the target protein, whereas effects observed only at 10 \u00b5M or higher concentrations are likely to reflect, at least in part, altered bilayer properties. It is furthermore possible to test for nonspecific bilayer effects using not only short-chain phosphoinositides but also other shortchain phospholipids.",
