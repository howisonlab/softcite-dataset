I conduct the first large-scale comparison of prices simultaneously collected from the websites and physical stores of 56 large multi-channel retailers in 10 countries.

(JEL D22, L11, L81, O14) Online prices are increasingly used for measurement and research applications. Since 2008, the Billion Prices Project (BPP) at MIT has been experimenting with daily online price indexes in the United States and other countries. 1 National statistical offices (NSOs) have recently started to consider the use of online data in official Consumer Price Indices (CPIs). 2 In the context of academic research, online prices are being used for a wide range of topics, including the study of price competition, market segmentation, price stickiness, international relative prices, and real exchange rate dynamics. 3 Despite their growing appeal, an open fundamental question about online prices is whether they are similar to the prices that can be collected offline in physical 1",

Using a combination of crowdsourcing platforms, a mobile phone app, and web scraping methods, I simultaneously collected prices in both the online and offline stores of 56 of the largest retailers in 10 countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States. These data are used to compare price levels, the behavior of price changes, and the selection of products available for sale in the offline and online stores. I document country, sector, and retailer heterogeneity, and test whether online prices vary with IP address locations or persistent browsing habits. The results have implications for NSOs and researchers using online data, as well as those interested in the effect of the Internet on retail prices.",

I first selected the retailers to be sampled by focusing on the top 20 companies by market shares in each country that sell both online and offline (\" multi-channel\"), and have product barcodes that can be matched across samples. Next, I used crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Elance, and UpWork to hire 323 workers to collect the offline data. Each worker was assigned a simple task: to scan the barcodes and collect prices for a random set of 10 to 50 products in any physical store of a given retailer. In some cases they had to return to the same store multiple times to scan the same set of products. Using a special app for android phones developed to simplify and standardize the data collection process, these workers scanned each product's barcode, manually entered the price, took a photo of the price tag, and sent all the information via e-mail to the BPP servers, where it was automatically processed and cleaned. A scraping software then used the barcode numbers to look for the same product in the website of each retailer, and collected the online price within a period of seven days. The matched online-offline dataset contains prices for more than 24,000 products and 38,000 observations sampled between December 2014 and March 2016.",

These percentages range from 42 percent in Brazil to 91 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom. The United States is close to the average, with 69 percent. At the sector level, drugstores and office-product retailers have the lowest share of identical prices, with 38 percent and 25 percent, respectively, while in electronics and clothing these numbers rise to 83 percent and 92 percent, respectively. When there is a price difference, the online markup tends to be small, with a magnitude of \u22124 percent in the full sample. If I include observations with identical prices, the online price difference is only \u22121 percent on average. I also find that price changes have similar frequencies and sizes in the online and offline data. However, only 19 percent of weekly price changes occur at the same time. While this is higher than the unconditional probability of a simultaneous price change, the individual price series are not well synchronized.",

Sales tend to create some discrepancies, with only 36 percent of sale prices being identical across samples, but they have a small impact in the aggregate results because the number of sale observations is relatively small (11 percent of the total dataset). A similar thing happens with offline price dispersion across physical stores, which tends to be low. Using a small sample of offline prices collected for multiple zip codes on the same day, I find that about 78 percent of goods have a single price within stores of the same retailer. I also found no evidence of \"dynamic pricing\" strategies that could potentially cause online-offline differences. At least in the United States, online prices do not change with the location of the IP address of the computer connecting to the website or when the scraping robot repeatedly browses the same web page of a particular good for a prolonged period of time. There is also no evidence that online-offline price differences are being driven by attempts to match the prices of Amazon.com, which are identical to the online prices in multi-channel retailers about 38 percent of the time.",

My results suggest that these prices are valid sources of information for retail transactions, even those that take place offline.

The fact that online prices are the same for all locations and also similar to offline prices collected from many different zip codes implies there is little within-retailer price dispersion. I also show this explicitly with some offline data in multiple zip codes in Section IVB. In practice, most retailers seem to have a single price for the majority of products, regardless of the location of the buyer and whether the product is sold online or at a particular offline store. This suggests that while the web has not reduced price dispersion across different retailers, as documented by a large literature surveyed by Baye, Morgan, and Scholten (2006), it may have created incentives for firms to price identically in their own stores. This type of within-retailer price dispersion has received little attention in the literature, even though it could have large welfare implications within countries.",

            "text": "This paper is related to a literature that studies the behavior of online prices. Some papers written in the early 2000s compared manually-collected prices of online retailers and traditional brick-and-mortar stores in a few narrow categories of goods. For example, Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000) compared prices for CDs and books in both online-only and multi-channel retailers (\"hybrids\" in their notation). They report that online prices were 9-16 percent lower and had smaller price changes, but note that \"findings would be strengthened if we excluded hybrid retailers from our comparisons of price levels,\" which implies that online and offline prices for multi-channel retailers were closer together (Brynjolfsson and Smith 2000, p. 572). Clay et al. (2002) also found similar prices for 107 books in both the websites and some physical stores of Barnes & Noble and Borders, which is consistent with my results. 4 More recent comparisons of online and offline prices expanded on the categories covered but were limited to small ad-hoc samples in a few stores. Examples include Rigobon (2014, 2015); Borraz et al. (2015); and Cavallo (forthcoming). A separate branch of the literature uses online prices from \"shopbots,\" or price comparison websites, which are easier to collect. Examples include Brynjolfsson and Smith (2001); Brynjolfsson, Dick, and Smith (2009); Ellison and Ellison (2009a, b); Lunnemann and Wintr (2011); Gorodnichenko, Sheremirov, and Talavera (2014); and Gorodnichenko and Talavera (2017). Although these papers do not directly compare prices with offline data, their results suggest that online prices change more frequently and with smaller sizes than comparable findings in papers with offline CPI prices. The difference with my findings is likely caused by their focus on retailers that participate in price-comparison websites. As Ellison and Ellison (2009a) discuss, such retailers face a uniquely competitive environment that can significantly affect their pricing behaviors.",

Many retailers worry about people who use mobile apps to scan the product's barcode and buy products online at other retailers, so if the data collectors spent too much time at each store, they might be asked to leave. 5 Two main versions of the task were posted on the crowdsourcing websites. In the simplest case, the worker had to use a mobile app provided by the BPP team to scan 10 to 50 random offline products in any physical store, with some basic instructions to spread out the data collection across categories of goods. This provided the bulk of the data that I use to compare price levels across samples.

For a recent example, see Kaplan and Menzio (2015). There are many reasons that can explain the apparent differences with my results. First, many papers in this literature compare data from different retailers, so that within retailer price dispersion is mixed with between retailer price dispersion. My results focus exclusively on price differences within retailers. Second, the price in scanner datasets is typically a weekly average. As I discuss in Cavallo (forthcoming), this can cause significant measurement error for some applications. For example, consider a good with identical prices in two stores, a price change on a Wednesday, and a single transaction in each store. If one store sold the good on a Monday, and the other on Friday, the \"weekly\" price will appear to be different when in fact prices were identical on a daily basis. Similarly, some scanner datasets tend to have unit values instead of prices. These are calculated as the ratio of sales to quantities sold, and can therefore be affected by the number of coupons used or the share of transactions that take place at different prices. Of course, for some purposes it makes sense to include coupons or transaction weights that affect the price actually paid by the consumer, but the fact that there is price dispersion caused by coupons should not lead us to believe that prices for the same goods are shown with different prices across stores of the same retailer. Third, price dispersion is often measured within a month or a quarter, so much of the difference in observed prices is caused by the same good being bought at different times. Finally, most scanner datasets contain prices for groceries and related goods. These are also the sectors for which I find more online-offline price dispersion, as well as offline price differences across physical stores.",

The Amazon prices considered here correspond to those products marked as \"Sold by Amazon.com.\" To be consistent with the rest of the paper, I focus on prices collected within seven days and excluding sales. More details on how these data were collected, as well as results for products with sales or sold by third-party sellers are provided in the online Appendix. Figure 2 compares Amazon's prices separately to both the offline and online prices from multi-channel firms. A large share of prices are identical in both cases, which is surprising given that this is comparing prices across different retailers. As expected, Amazon's prices are closer to the online prices. They are identical to the online prices approximately 38 percent of the time, and the average price difference is \u22125 percent. The same estimates for the Amazon-offline comparison are 31 percent and \u22126 percent respectively. This finding does not mean that multi-channel retailers are making their online and offline prices different to match the online price to Amazon's. In fact, as Table 8 shows, the conditional probability of having an identical online price with Amazon Notes: Column 3 shows the percentage of observations that have identical online and offline prices.

The problem with this number, however, is that the automated matching procedure can fail for many reasons: the worker may scan the wrong barcode, the app may incorrectly read the barcode, or the scraping robot may fail while checking the website. To get a better estimate of the overlap degree, the BPP team manually checked how many of the offline products could also be found online for a sample of 100-200 observations per retailer using all the information submitted by the workers, including the product description readable in the photo of the price tag. The results, grouped by country, are reported in Table 9. As can be expected given the large product variety in these websites, a large fraction of goods found offline can also be found online. On average, 76 percent of all products randomly collected at the physical stores could also be found on the retailer's website.

Online prices are not only cheaper to collect, but they also provide information for all goods sold by each retailer, with many details per product, uncensored price spells, and can be collected on a high-frequency basis without any delays. Of course, there are also many potential disadvantages of using online data, including limited sector coverage and the lack of information on quantities, as we discuss in Cavallo and Rigobon (2016).

This might even be affecting cross-country pricing, as suggested by Cavallo, Neiman, and Rigobon (2014), where we found evidence that global firms such as Apple and IKEA tend to price identically in countries that use the same currency, where it is trivial for consumers to compare prices across borders.",

See Balakrishnan, Sundaresan, and Zhang (2013) for an economic analysis of showrooming practices.6 See https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mit.bpp. The app can be downloaded for free, but a \"project code\" must be requested from the BPP team.
