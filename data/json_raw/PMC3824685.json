            "text": "Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a novel tumor suppressor, inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as promotes cell apoptosis in tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of its tumor-suppressive function remains largely unknown in tumors including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, downregulated PDCD4 expression was significantly associated with the status of NPC progression and poor prognosis. PDCD4 markedly suppressed the ability of cell proliferation and cell survival by modulating C-MYC-controlled cell cycle and BCL-2-mediated mitochondrion apoptosis resistance signals, and oncogenic transcription factor C-JUN in NPC. Furthermore, miR-184, a tumor-suppressive miRNA modulated by PDCD4 directly targeting BCL2 and C-MYC, participated in PDCD4-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and survival in NPC. Further, we found that PDCD4 decreased the binding of C-Jun to the AP-1 element on the miR-184 promoter regions by PI3K/AKT/JNK/C-Jun pathway and stimulated miR-184 expression. In clinical fresh specimens, reduced PDCD4 mRNA level was positively correlated with miR-184 expression in NPC. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that PDCD4 as tumor suppressor regulated miR-184-mediated direct targeting of BCL2 and C-MYC via PI3K/AKT and JNK/C-Jun pathway attenuating cell proliferation and survival in NPC.",

            "text": "Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is localized to chromosome band 10q24 and comprises two basic domains at the N-terminus and C-terminus involving nuclear localization signals and two conserved helical MA-3 domains associated with protein-protein interactions in eIF4GI and eIF4GII with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase eIF4A proposing the repression of translation initiation. 1,2 During investigation of apoptosis, PDCD4 was first identified as an upregulated gene. However, a growing number of reports have pointed to PDCD4 as a new tumor suppressor gene involved in the apoptotic machinery, which suppresses cell transformation, tumorigenesis and invasion at present. [3][4][5][6] Furthermore, PDCD4 expression is significantly downregulated in various human cancers, as well as in cancer cell lines, and this has been associated with a poor patient prognosis. 4,7,8 However, the detailed functional mechanism of PDCD4 in tumor pathogenesis is not clear yet, including NPC. NPC is the most common cancer in certain regions of Southern China and Southest Asia than elsewhere, with viral, dietary and genetic factors implicated in its causation, which may often drive abnormal gene expression and contribute to the initiation and development of NPC. [9][10][11][12][13][14] In previous investigation, we used cDNA microarray to examine differentially expressed genes among NPC tissues and nasopharynx tissues. By means of the analysis of BRB array tools, the expression of PDCD4 was shown to be markedly decreased in NPC tissues, suggesting a possible role of PDCD4 in suppressing the pathogenesis of NPC. 9 In this study, we investigated the expression pattern, the effects and molecular basis of PDCD4 on cell growth and apoptosis in NPC. Our studies demonstrated that reduced PDCD4 expression as a tumor suppressor modulated miR-184 stimulating NPC progression and poor prognosis.",

From Lee et al.'s 15 microarray data (GSE2370), PDCD4 was downexpressed in NPC tissues compared with NP tissues by an average of 0.60 folds ( Figure 1A). This expression pattern was similar to our microarray data comparing NPC cells and NP tissues. 9 QPCR analysis indicated that the PDCD4 expression level was significantly decreased in eight NPC cell lines and NPCs in comparison to NP tissues (Po0.0001) ( Figure 1B). Furthermore, we also observed the decreased expression tendency of PDCD4 in clinical stage of III-IV compared with I-II (Supplementary Figure S1A) and lymph node metastasis (N classification) of N2-N3 compared with N0-N1 (Supplementary Figure S1B). However, no statistically significant difference was shown in T3-T4 compared with T1-T2 (Supplementary Figure S1C) as well as in M1 compared with M0 (Supplementary Figure S1D). Similar to mRNA expression pattern, the PDCD4 protein expression was significantly decreased in five NPCs in comparison to three NPs using western blot examination ( Figure 1C). Finally, immunohistochemical staining indicated that PDCD4 protein was lowly expressed in NPC samples compared with noncancerous tissues (Po0.001, Figure 1D; Supplementary  Table S9).",

However, we observed that the reduced expression level of PDCD4 was markedly correlated with tumor size (T classification; P \u00bc 0.026), lymph node metastasis (N classification; N0-N1 versus N2-N3, P \u00bc 0.036) and clinical stage (I-II versus III-IV, P \u00bc 0.002) in NPC patients. In addition, we observed that the level of PDCD4 protein expression was significantly correlated with overall survival, as patients with lower levels of PDCD4 expression had poorer survival ( Figure 1E) than those with higher levels of PDCD4 expression (Po0.001). Furthermore, we also found that increased expression of PDCD4 showed better prognosis in NPC patients, regardless of disease stage, T, N and M classifications ( Supplementary Figures S2A-F). Multivariate analysis showed that decreased PDCD4 expression was a poor independent prognostic factor for NPC patients (Po0.001; Supplementary Table S11).",

Clone1 and 2 cells with the highest PDCD4 expression were obtained in seven stably transfected cell clones by qPCR and western blot assays (Figures 2a and b). The growth curves and colony formation assay showed that PDCD4 significantly inhibited cell proliferation of clone1 and 2 cells in comparison to scramble and parental line 5-8F cells (Figures 2c and d). Furthermore, we also observed that overexpressed PDCD4 blocked cell cycle transition from G1 to S and G2 phase (Figure 2e) and induced cell apoptosis in clone1 and 2 cells compared with their control cells (Figure 2f). To further confirm the growth-suppressive effect of PDCD4, we performed in vivo tumorigenesis study in nude mice. The results showed that the average volume of these two clone cells was significantly decreased compared with scramble cells (Figure 2g). Immunohistochemistry examination indicated increased PDCD4 expression in clone1 and 2 xenograft tumor specimens than in scramble cells (Figure 2h). Interestingly, inversed results were also observed in short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of PDCD4 in HONE1 and SUNE1 NPC cells with the highest mRNA expression levels of PDCD4 ( Supplementary  Figures S3A-C). We found that suppressing PDCD4 significantly elevated cell proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle transition and cell survival in shPDCD4 NPC cells in comparison to shScramble NPC cells ( Supplementary  Figures S3D-G).",

PDCD4 has been reported to regulate PI3K/AKT pathway and JNK expression in some tumors. 16,17 In this study, we also examined the effect of PDCD4 on the expression of PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways in NPC. Western blot analysis showed that overexpressed or reduced PDCD4 significantly reduced or increased the expression of phos-PI3K and phos-AKT (Figures 3a and b), but not their total protein levels ( Supplementary Figures S4A  and B), respectively. Furthermore, we also observed the suppressed or elevated expression of JNK in PDCD4overexpressed or PDCD4-reduced NPC cells, respectively (Figures 3a and b). In previous studies, C-JUN, cell cycle and cell apoptosis signals-associated moleculars as downstream signals had been shown to be modulated by PI3K/AKT and JNK pathways, 8,11,18 we thus examined their protein expression in PDCD4-overexpressed NPC 5-8F cells and PDCD4-suppressed NPC HONE1 and SUNE1 cells. Using western blotting analysis, we first examined the expression of C-JUN (AP1) and cell cycle factors associated with cell proliferation. We found that knocking down endogenous PDCD4 expression or introduction of PDCD4 induced or blocked the expression of C-JUN, pRB C-MYC, CCND1 and E2F1, respectively (Figures 3c and d). However, the change in the expression of CDK4, p15 and p27 ( Supplementary  Figures S4A and B) was not observed in both the cell types. Moreover, we observed that knocking down endogenous PDCD4 expression or introduction of PDCD4 induced or decreased the expression of BCL2-mediated suppression of the cleavage of CASP9, 3, 6, 7, and PARP in NPC cells (Figures 4a and b).",

To study the mechanism of miR-184 suppressing cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis in NPC, we examined expression of cell cycle and apoptotic genes. Interestingly, similar to PDCD4-mediated pathways, miR-184 mimics suppressed the expression of pRB, C-MYC, CCND1 and E2F1 ( Figure 6a) but not p15 and CDK4 in cell cycle transition (Supplementary Figure S6), downregulated the BCL2 expression and induced the cleavage of CASP9, 3, 6, 7 and PARP ( Figure 6b) but not PDCD4 in apoptosis pathway (Supplementary Figure S6). Furthermore, we found that BCL2 and C-MYC were potentially direct targets of miR-184 by RNAhybrid and miRwalk assays (Supplementary Figure S7). In a preceding experiment, miR-184 mimics downregulated the protein expression of BCL2 and C-MYC in NPC. Subsequently, we transfected miR-184 inhibitor into SUNE1 and 5-8F cells and found elevated expression levels of BCL2 and C-MYC ( Figure 6c). We further performed luciferase reporter assay to determine whether miR-184 could directly target the C-MYC coding region (CDS) and 3 0 UTR of BCL2 in NPC cells. Wild-type (wt) or mutant (mt) 3'UTR vector of BCL2 and miR-184 mimics or inhibitor NPC cells were cotransfected with NPC SUNE1 cells. The results showed a significant decrease of luciferase activity in wt vector transfected with miR-184 mimics (Figure 6d, lanes 1 and 2; Po0.001) or an obvious increase of luciferase activity by using miR-184 inhibitor (Figure 6d, lanes 3 and 4; Po0.001) when compared with miR control, whereas the activity of mt vector was unaffected (Figure 6d, lanes 5 and 6, P \u00bc 0.092) by using miR-184 mimics or inhibitor. Similar to the result of BCL2, a significant decrease of luciferase activity in wt vector of C-MYC CDS was showed by using miR-184 mimics (Figure 6e, lanes 1 and 2 Po0.001) or an obvious increase of luciferase activity by transfecting miR-184 inhibitor (Figure 6e, lanes 3 and 4; Po0.001) compared with miR control; whereas the activity of mt vector was unaffected (Figure 6e, lanes 5 and 6, P \u00bc 0.36) by using miR-184 mimics or inhibitor. Taken together, these results strongly supported that BCL2 and C-MYC were the direct targets of miR-184 in NPC cells.",

Further, qPCR analysis indicated that the expression of miR-184 was markedly increased in both the cells with knocked down expression of C-JUN (Figure 7b), which suggested that C-JUN is an upstream regulator of miR-184. In a subsequent investigation, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with qPCR analysis to confirm that C-JUN could bind putative miR-184 promoter and activate its expression in NPC (Figure 7c). Finally, we used specific inhibitor of PI3K to suppress the expression of PI3K or specific siRNA to reduce JNK expression and observed that the protein expression of C-JUN was decreased in NPC SUNE1 and 5-8F cells (Figures 7d and e). Our results demonstrated that PDCD4 stimulated the expression of miR-184 through PI3K/AKT/ JNK/C-JUN pathway.",

Moreover, we observed that specific PDCD4 protein staining was found in the cytoplasm and nuclei of malignant epithelial cells and noncancerous tissues but predominantly expressed in cytoplasm by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, we also found that attenuated PDCD4 expression was negatively associated with T classification, N classification and clinical stages of NPC patients. Furthermore, we also observed that lost PDCD4 protein expression in NPC was positively correlated with patient's overall survival. Patients with lower expression of PDCD4 protein had a shorter overall survival time. Multivariate analyses showed that decreased expression of PDCD4 protein was a significant independent predictor of poor prognosis for NPC patients. The results mentioned above suggested PDCD4 as a significant suppressor in NPC, which is similar to other reports of PDCD4 in some tumors. [19][20][21][22] Subsequently, we presented the evidence that PDCD4 was taken a tumor suppressor participating in NPC pathogenesis.",

In this investigation, miR-184 was shown to be significantly downexpressed in NPC cells of knocking down PDCD4 expression compared to scramble NPC cells by miRNA array and qPCR examinations. Dysregulation of miR-184 was preliminarily reported as a potential oncomir promoting cell proliferation and blocking cell apoptosis in tongue carcinoma. 23 In subsequent studies, miR-184 was shown as a tumor suppressor involved in suppressing cell survival and growth by targeting AKT2 in neuroblastoma cell. 24 In our study,  Figure 7 PDCD4 regulated the expression of miR-184 via PI3K/AKT/JNK pathway in NPC. (a) siRNAs were used to suppress the C-JUN expression by western blot examination. (b) Knocking down C-JUN expression by siRNA stimulated the expression of miR-184 in NPC SUNE1 and 5-8F cells. (c) From mock and pcDNA3.1-C-JUNtransfected SUNE1 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-C-JUN and a normal rabbit IgG. The AP-1 binding sites on the immunoprecipitated DNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Amplification of input chromatin (input) before immunoprecipitation was served as positive controls for chromatin extraction and PCR amplification. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using a non-specific antibody (normal human IgG) served as negative controls. QPCR analysis indicated that C-Jun could bind more miR-184 promoter region than that in control group in NPC SUNE1 cells. (d) Suppressing the expression of PI3K by its specific inhibitor Ly294002 (50 nM) reduced pPI3K, pAKT and C-JUN expression in NPC SUNE1 and 5-8F cells, but did not induce AKT expression change. (e) Knocking down JNK1 suppressed the expression of C-Jun in NPC SUNE1 and 5-8F cells. (f) Specific inhibition of JNK1 by siRNA decreased the expression of JNK and C-Jun in NPC cells. Data are presented as mean\u00b1S.D. of three independent experiments (*Po0.05) miR-184, identified as a potential tumor suppressor, repressed cell growth by modulating C-MYC-controlled cell cycle transition and BCL2-suppressed mitochondrion apoptosis, which was consistent with the role of PDCD4 in NPC. However, miR-184 mimics did not control the expression of PDCD4, which hinted that miR-184 was a downstream regulator of PDCD4. Subsequently, we investigated miR-184-regulated genes possibly involved in cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. Excitingly, C-MYC coding region and BCL-2 3 0 UTR were predicted as miR-184-targeted region by bioinformatics assay. Our experiments further validated this speculation that miR-184 directly targeted C-MYC and BCL-2 expression. These results demonstrated that miR-184 participated in PDCD4-mediated suppression of cell growth and survival in NPC.",

DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from SUNE1 cells by using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following polyclonal antibodies: anti-C-JUN and normal mouse IgG (Millipore), the latter served as a control for nonspecific DNA binding. The precipitated DNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using specific primers. The primers ( Supplementary Table S8) were utilized to amplify across the miR-184 promoter region.",

The chi-square test was applied to the examination of relationship between PDCD4 expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards method was used for analyzing the relationship between the variables and patient's survival time. The relationship between PDCD4 and miR-184 expression was explored by Pearson test. Two-tailed Student's t test was used for comparisons of two independent groups. One-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups for all in vitro analyses. A P-value of o0.05 was considered statistically significant.",
