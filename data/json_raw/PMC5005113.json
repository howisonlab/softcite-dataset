Our aim was to study the potential association between sputum fungus and adverse respiratory effects in such workers. In a group of sawmill workers, we administered a respiratory questionnaire, performed lung function testing and quantified the proportions of leukocytes in spontaneously expectorated sputum samples. We identified fungal species by DNA sequencing. Of 54 sawmill workers, 19 yielded fungal positive sputum samples (mean age 42.5\u00b110.4 years) and 35 were negative for fungus (mean age 36.9\u00b15.2 years). The fungus was identified as Candida sp. in all samples. Those with fungal-positive sputum, compared to others, reported more cough (26% versus 63%) and haemoptysis (6% versus 37%) (both p<0.05), manifested reduced forced midexpiratory flow rates (FEF25-75%) (82.3\u00b14.5 versus 69.2\u00b19.9% predicted, p<0.001), and had higher sputum eosinophil counts (median 9.25 versus 3.25%, p<0.01). Reduction of FEF25-75% was associated both with fungus detection in sputum (\u221212.7%, 95% CI\u22128.5-\u221216.9%) and sputum eosinophils (\u22122.1% per 1% increase in eosinophils, 95% CI \u22121.5-\u22122.8%) (both p<0.001). In sawmill workers, Candida sp. detectable in sputum was associated with respiratory symptoms, sputum eosinophilia and reduced FEF25-75%.",

The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates was taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in <50% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site.

Contamination of sputum by Candida sp., if present on repeated examination, is presumed to reflect airway contamination and this can be clinically relevant. The syndrome of allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM), for example, even though most commonly associated with Aspergillus sp., is also seen with chronic airway candidiasis, and includes eosinophilia and airflow obstruction [34]. In the occupational milieu, chronic inhalational exposure to fungus is more closely linked to extrinsic allergic alveolitis than ABPM. Multiple occupational studies have quantified airborne fungal contamination in working environments in which various organic materials are processed, including wood products [6,[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]. Systematic assessment of fungal sputum contamination in occupational cohorts also has been studied but to a much more limited extent in selected high-risk cohorts other than woodworkers, such as malt, sugar cane and flax workers [35][36][37]. These studies have identified a high proportion of sputum samples positive for fungus although, unlike our study, the contamination was polymicrobial for a range of fungal species, and Candida sp., although present in 3-6%, was not dominant in any of the cohorts [35,37]. An earlier study of a nonexposed occupational population (urban telephone company employees) found that a minority produced fungus-contaminated sputum samples and that Candida sp. also was uncommon among those [38].",

Nonetheless, the growth of Candida would have been promoted under the incubation conditions used (both by temperature and relatively short duration), which could have contributed to its dominance in the genotyping component of the analysis. Although we identified an association between sputum fungal contamination and both sputum eosinophilia and a lung function decrement, we cannot exclude the latter being a simply a marker  of another unmeasured and confounding coexposure. Such an exposure could be to other microbes, endotoxins, glucans or wood dust itself, none of which we measured. We did not have industrial hygiene sampling data or other direct exposure measures quantifying airborne concentrations of these exposures. Moreover, adequate characterisation of such exposures would have required multiple assessments at a number of different time-points given the likely variability in such bioaerosol exposures.",

Radiographic imaging, which was not available, could have provided valuable additional data, for example, computed tomography-assessed air trapping or even the detection of fungus-associated changes that might have correlated with the sputum fungus-associated complaint of haemoptysis [39]. Although reduced FEF25-75% indeed could be an early marker of airway disease that would later progress, our cross-sectional study cannot assess that prospective outcome. Furthermore, we did not have any clinical diagnostic assessment of the participants to assess the presence or absence of lung diseases such as asthma, COPD, bronchiectasis or tuberculosis.",

We also acknowledge that we did not have access to a formal external control group of non-sawmill workers for sputum Candida testing and thus cannot comment on what the general population prevalence of such fungal detection might be. Rather, our analysis was more analogous to a nested design in which the Candida-positive workers were \"cases\" and those that were negative served as \"referents\" for comparison. Although we ultimately studied 68% of the target population, it is possible that those not studied differed in systematic ways that could have impacted the estimated prevalence of fungal detection. For example, spirometry test failure has been associated with airway disease [40]. In contrast, inability to produce sputum could theoretically be associated with an absence of disease, having the opposite association with fungal prevalence.",
