Bilirubin, one of the metabolites of heme degraded by heme oxygenase, is a potent anti-oxidant. We verified the effect of serum bilirubin level on the incidence of hypertension in normotensive subjects. We grouped 1,208 normotensive subjects by the criterion of the highest quintile value of serum bilirubin, 1.1 mg/dL. The incidence of hypertension was higher in group 1 with bilirubin less than 1.1 mg/ dL than in group 2 with bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL or more (186/908 vs. 43/300, p=0.018). The relative risk for hypertension was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.99), p=0.048 in group 2 compared to group 1 by Cox's proportional hazard model. Among the groups stratified by gender, smoking, and liver function status, the group 2 showed a lower risk of hypertension in females and in non-smokers. In conclusion, a mild increase within the physiological range of serum bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with the incidence of hypertension. The effect of bilirubin on the development of hypertension was more evident in females and in non-smokers.",

            "text": "Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate limiting enzyme for the breakdown of heme to generate carbon monoxide, iron, and biliverdin. Biliverdin is rapidly converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (1). Experimental evidence suggests that the induction of HO-1, the inducible isoform of HO, is an important endogenous mechanism for cytoprotection and the downstream products of heme degradation may mediate the beneficial effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties, etc (1). Induction of HO-1 has also been demonstrated to lower blood pressure in several animal models, including the spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) and experimental renovascular hypertension, as well as in angiotensin II-dependent hypertension (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10). However, the mechanism by which HO-1 induction lowers blood pressure has not been fully verified. One possible mechanisms is decreasing vascular resistance by the HO-driven carbon monoxide (8,9,11). HO-1 also plays a crucial role in significant attenuation of angiotensin II-medicated tubulointerstitial injury and saltresistant hypertension (6). An additional possible anti-hypertensive process linked to the induction of HO-1 is the anti-oxidant activity of heme degradation products. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been known to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of hypertension (12). The increased ROS production in the renal medulla is a key component of angiotensin II-dependent hypertension (13). Renal medullary superoxide production generated by angiotensin II infusion to the animal model is normalized with decreased blood pressure by pretreatment with HO-1 inducer (7). The major mechanism by which HO-1 induction reduces ROS is through the generation of bilirubin, a potent antioxidant (14). Increased levels of bilirubin can prevent the pressor actions of angiotensin II through the scavenging of superoxide anions in the vasculature (15) and also inhibit NADPH oxidase (16) and protein kinase C activity (17), both of which mediate angiotensin IIinduced vascular injury (18).",

The systolic pressure was measured when the first sound was heard at the beginning of phase I of Korotkoff sound. The diastolic pressure was measured from the moment the sound could not be heard at the end of phase IV of Korotkoff sound. In some case, such as subjects with aortic regurgitation, the muffling of phase IV Korotkoff sound continued at the lowest level.

Differences in proportions among the subject groups were compared by the Pearson's chi-square test. Group differences for continuous variables were assessed by the Student t-test. We defined the event period as the duration from the date of the first health check-up to the date when subjects had become hypertensive during follow-up health check-up (s). We compared the cumulative incidence of hypertension between the bilirubin groups by Log-rank test. To determine whether the bilirubin category was associated independently with the incidence of hypertension, we used Cox's proportional hazard model adjusted for serum albumin and univariate risk factors for the development of hypertension. We checked the violation of the proportional hazard assumption by partial residual plot against time for each covariate and log minus log plots (LML) for categorical covariates, such as bilirubin group. The average values of residuals for covariates includ-  ed in Cox's model were zero and the LML for each categorical variable was parallel. Two-sided p values are reported, with 0.05 taken as the level of statistical significance. All data are shown as mean\u00b1standard deviation or frequency per observation.",

Increased ROS has been demonstrated in the SHR (24), DOCA-salt hypertensive (25), and Dahl salt-sensitive rats (26), as well as in hypertension induced by angiotensin II (27). In humans, enhanced production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated in untreated individuals with mild to moderate hypertension. This abnormality can be reversed by the control of hypertension with beta blockers or ACE inhibitors (28).

Subjects with liver dysfunction had more risk factors to develop hypertension, such as higher BMI, higher frequency of diabetes mellitus, and higher rate of hyperuricemia, compared to subjects with normal liver function (data not shown). The bilirubin effect on the development of hypertension may have been overwhelmed by those risk factors in subjects with liver dysfunction.

            "text": "This study suffered several limitations. Firstly, blood pressure was measured just once in the sitting position using a mercury sphygmomanometer. We asked subjects about their smoking habit, duration of smoking, and amount of smoking but could only get information on the smoking habit (current smoker or non-current smoker) at a reasonable rate among the subjects. We therefore could not analyze the effect of duration and smoking amount on the development of hypertension. Although the subjects were asked to fast for at least 12 hr before the blood tests, we did not confirm the exact fasting period before the measurement of serum bilirubin concentration. We used the unit of mg/dL for serum bilirubin concentration although the SI units (\u03bc M/L) are more informative and better able to discriminate serum bilirubin levels within the physiological range (19). We did not have information about age at menopause and estrogen replacement therapy in women which could affect on the development of hypertension. But, the mean age of female was not different between two bilirubin groups (p=0.072) and the number of females aged more than 47 yr, which is the mean age at menopause in Korean women (33), was not different between bilirubin groups, either (p=0.086). In younger subjects aged less than 50 yr, RR for the development of hypertension was 0.605 (95% CI, 0.372-0.984, p=0.043) in bilirubin group 2 compared to bilirubin group 1 and, in older subjects aged 50 yr or more, RR for the development of hypertension was not different between bilirubin groups (p=0.299). Although we could not assure whether the menopause and the estrogen replacement therapy were confounding factors to the relationship between bilirubin group and the incidence of hypertension in older subjects, the bilirubin effect on the hypertension was at least meaningful in younger subjects.",
