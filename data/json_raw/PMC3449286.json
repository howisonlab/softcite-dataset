            "text": "Porphyry systems supply most copper and significant gold to our economy. Recent studies indicate that they are frequently associated with high Sr/Y magmatic rocks, but the meaning of this association remains elusive. Understanding the association between high Sr/Y magmatic rocks and porphyry-type deposits is essential to develop genetic models that can be used for exploration purposes. Here we present results on a Pleistocene volcano of Ecuador that highlight the behaviour of copper in magmas with variable (but generally high) Sr/Y values. We provide indirect evidence for Cu partitioning into a fluid phase exsolved at depths of ,15 km from high Sr/Y (.70) andesitic magmas before sulphide saturation. This lends support to the hypothesis that large amounts of Cu-and S-bearing fluids can be accumulated into and released from a long-lived high Sr/Y deep andesitic reservoir to a shallower magmatic-hydrothermal system with the potential of generating large porphyry-type deposits.",

It has been recognized for some time that porphyry-type deposits are associated with magmatic arcs 2 , but only in recent years have links with high Sr/Y (.40) andesitic to dacitic magmas been established [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] . The genesis of high Sr/Y arc magmas is a subject of debate, with interpretations for their origins including: (i) slab melting 11,12 , (ii) lower crust melting 13,14 or (iii) fractional crystallization of amphibole 6 garnet [15][16][17][18] , possibly accompanied by crustal melting and assimilation 19,20 . On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that the high Sr/Y magmas associated with porphyry systems are not slab melts 21 , but derive from magmatic evolution at mid-to deep crustal levels [7][8][9][10]22,23 . Here, magmas fractionate amphibole 6 garnet but not plagioclase, leading to relative Y depletion and Sr enrichment in the residual melt. Fractional crystallization is often accompanied also by partial melting and assimilation of mid-to lower crustal rocks by the evolving magmas 8 .",

We provide indirect evidence that copper is exsolved into a fluid phase from a high Sr/Y andesitic magma at depths of up to ,15 km. This allows us to link into a coherent model two aspects that previous studies have considered to be critical in the formation of porphyry systems: (i) the role of deep mafic/ intermediate intrusions recharging shallower felsic systems with fluids and metals [32][33][34][35][36] , and (ii) the role of water-rich high Sr/Y magmas 9,22 .",

Subsequently these melts ascended up to mid-crustal levels where they underwent varying degrees of magmatic evolution in a composite reservoir. This evolution occurred through pronounced amphibole and clinopyroxene fractionation, crustal assimilation and incremental recharge by high-alumina basalts rising from depth 37 . This mid-crustal open system evolution, highlighted by the correlations between whole rock geochemistry (including Sr/Y), radiogenic isotopes and modal mineralogy, is remarkably similar to that of giant porphyry systems like Yanacocha 8 (Supplementary Material 1).

Incompatible element poorer magmas with lower Sr/Y (40-50) did not evolve significantly in the mid-crustal reservoir and reflect the compositions of the hydrous, high-alumina basaltic andesites formed at the mantle-crust boundary 37 . These magmas crystallized small amounts of amphibole (,3% modal) during ascent to shallow levels where degassing caused extensive plagioclase crystallization, magma stalling, and mixing in the conduit (at P,0.1 GPa) with high-alumina basaltic magmas coming from depth 37 . In contrast, incompatible element-rich magmas with higher Sr/Y (.50 and up to 80) resulted from more or less prolonged evolution in the midcrustal (,0.4 GPa) composite reservoir where they fractionated, assimilated and were recharged by the high-alumina mafic magma 37 . Magmas with higher Sr/Y values contain significantly more amphibole (up to ,20% modal) 37 . Therefore, modal amphibole concentrations suggest that increasing water contents in magmas with higher Sr/Y values occur as a consequence of more extensive fractionation at midcrustal levels 37 . Throughout the series, magmas are strongly oxidized (fO 2 5NNO11.5 to 13.3). The high oxidation state of the Pilavo magmas is recorded by magnetite-ilmenite pairs within amphibole and is likely the result of both an oxidized mantle source and an intracrustal evolution in which amphibole fractionation occurs 37 .",

Maximum Cu pyroxene contents remain consistently below 30 ppm throughout the Pilavo series rocks (Supplementary Material 2). In contrast, maximum Cu amphibole and Cu plagioclase contents vary with rock geochemistry (Figure 1): rocks with lower Sr/Y values have much higher Cu amphibole (.200 ppm) and Cu plagioclase (generally 400-500 but up to .2000 ppm) than rocks with high Sr/Y (Cu plagioclase and Cu amphibole 5 40250 ppm). In low Sr/Y rocks the highest Cu plagioclase contents occur in plagioclase growth zones with abundant fluid and melt inclusions, situated between core and rim (Figures 2a-b). Within the inclusion-free zones the Cu plagioclase contents drop significantly (,5 ppm; Supplementary Materials 2 and 5). During ablation, Cu amphibole exhibits a smooth and stable intensity signal ( Supplementary Material 3). In contrast, the Cu plagioclase intensities resulting from the ablation of the inclusion-rich areas of plagioclase vary erratically with high peaks lifting the average concentrations of the time-integrated analyses (Supplementary Material 3). These peaks are likely the result of ablating Cu-rich inclusions within the plagioclase. In order to test such a hypothesis we have investigated by SEM plagioclase fragments that had been hammer-broken and not washed to preserve the integrity of soluble phases possibly occurring in fluid inclusions. Indeed, SEM imaging reveals tiny (#1 mm) Cu-Fe-sulphides within mm to sub-mm sized fluid inclusions, which are too small to be individually analysed by LA-ICPMS ( In Pilavo rocks plagioclase occurs dominantly as micro-phenocrysts in the groundmass, suggesting that it has crystallized during decompression at shallow levels. This is supported by a decrease in the anorthite content from the inclusion-rich cores (An$80 mol.%) to the inclusion-free rims (An#70 mol.%). Such an anorthite change is consistent with a decrease in the water content of the magma coexisting with plagioclase 37,38 . Thus, the melt/fluid inclusion-rich zones document plagioclase growth during decompression-induced degassing. During degassing Cu, as experimentally predicted [39][40][41] , has partitioned into the vapour-rich fluid phase, which was trapped within the plagioclase-hosted fluid inclusions. Cu-sulphides have subsequently precipitated from such vapour-rich fluid phase within the inclusions.",

            "text": "The systematically decreasing Cu amphibole concentrations in rocks with increasing Sr/Y values and decreasing MgO (Figure 1a) cannot reflect magmatic fractionation of Cu-bearing minerals. Sulphides, which can incorporate large amounts of Cu 42 , are clearly late-stage in both lower (see above) and higher Sr/Y rocks (see below). The Cu partition coefficient between melt and a clinopyroxene-amphibole assemblage fractionating in Pilavo magmas with a conservative ratio of 1:1 37 is .1. Therefore, Cu concentrations would increase in the residual melt during fractionation of such an assemblage (amphibole and clinopyroxene partition coefficient values from 43 and http:// earthref.org/GERM/, respectively). This is supported by: (i) the core-to-rim increase of Cu amphibole concentrations in amphiboles of lower Sr/Y rocks, (ii) the core-to-rim decreases in compatible  elements (Mg, Ni) and (iii) the core-to-rim increases in incompatible elements (e.g., Zr, La, Hf) (Supplementary Material 6). Such zoning highlights the incompatible behaviour of Cu during magmatic differentiation under oxidized conditions 44 . We have modelled the increase of Cu concentrations in Pilavo magmas that would result from their evolution through the recharge, assimilation, fractional crystallization (RAFC) process proposed by 37 . Modelling is based on 5 steps of RAFC (Supplementary Material 7) for a mildly incompatible behaviour of Cu ( Cu K melt/bulk minerals 5 2). The calculated Cu concentrations for the most evolved Pilavo magma with the highest (,80) Sr/ Y value of Pilavo rocks would be ,100 ppm. This is significantly higher than the measured Cu concentrations (37-58 ppm) in whole rocks with similarly high Sr/Y values (70-80). An alternative which can explain the decreasing Cu amphibole concentrations in the rocks with higher Sr/Y values is that amphibole has crystallized from or has equilibrated with magmas that have previously exsolved a fluid phase (see also 33,45 ). In fact, Cu will partition into the fluid phase upon fluid saturation of a magma (K fluid/melt .1 for Cu [39][40][41] ) and the magma coexisting with such a fluid will consequently become Cu-poorer. Although recent work by 46 suggests relatively low volatile phase/mafic melt partition coefficients of 2-6 for Cu, these values were calculated for an anhydrous basaltic melt. The water-rich Pilavo basaltic andesite magmas share little resemblance to anhydrous magmas and clearly additional work is needed 46 to quantify Cu partitioning into a fluid phase exsolved from hydrous andesitic magmas. Amphiboles crystallized at P,0.4 GPa in the more evolved (higher Sr/Y) rocks of Pilavo 37 . Therefore, fluid saturation and the associated Cu partitioning into such fluid phase must have occurred at relatively deep crustal levels (up to ,15 km).",

Like Cu, also Li has a K fluid/melt .1 47 but K amphibole/fluid for Li/Cu is .1 43,48 , i.e., Li has less affinity for the fluid phase compared to Cu. Therefore, systematically shallower slopes of Cu-Li correlations in amphiboles of increasingly evolved (higher Sr/Y) rocks (Figure 3b) further support amphibole crystallization from or equilibration with magmas that have increasingly exsolved a fluid phase. Diffusive equilibration of Cu in amphibole, potentially explaining the low Cu and flat coreto-rim Cu profiles of amphiboles from higher Sr/Y rocks (Supplementary Material 6), would require only a few years of magmatic residence time (Supplementary Material 8). That in higher Sr/Y rocks most of the Cu has partitioned into the fluid phase at high pressure is further confirmed by the very low Cu contents in the fluid/melt inclusion-rich zones of their plagioclase phenocrysts compared to the fluid/melt inclusion-rich zones of plagioclase in lower Sr/Y rocks ( Supplementary Material 5). In other words, in contrast with lower Sr/Y magmas there was little Cu left in the higher Sr/Y magmas during shallow level decompression-driven fluid exsolution when plagioclase phenocrysts crystallized.",

            "text": "Higher Sr/Y rocks have similar whole rock Cu contents (37-58 ppm) to lower Sr/Y rocks (32-64 ppm). However, our modelling (see above and Supplementary Material 7) indicates that the most evolved magmas (with higher Sr/Y values) should contain higher Cu concentrations (,100 ppm) than those actually measured in the similarly evolved whole rocks (,60 ppm). From this we infer that a portion of the Cu has escaped from the Cu-rich and high Sr/Y andesitic magma along with the fluid phase. Cu is hosted by different mineral phases in the two rock types. In higher Sr/Y rocks the bulk of Cu is hosted by abundant, several mm-sized, Cu-Fe-sulphides occurring within groundmass magnetite (Figure 2e-f; Supplementary Material 9). In lower Sr/Y rocks such large Cu-Fe sulphides associated with magnetite have not been observed and the bulk of Cu occurs in the tiny (#1 mm) Cu-sulphides within plagioclase-hosted fluid inclusions (Figure 2c) and in Cu-rich amphiboles. The exclusive association of Cu-sulphides with magnetite in high Sr/Y rocks highlights the important role of magnetite crystallization in causing sulphide saturation in silicate magmas 44,49 . Following 44 , sulphide saturation might have occurred within the melt boundary layer surrounding growing magnetite due to a rapid switch in sulphur redox conditions, which was triggered by magnetite crystallization. Based on textural observations 37 , the groundmass magnetite of high Sr/Y rocks crystallized late, after amphibole and synchronous with plagioclase and clinopyroxene microcrysts. These observations are in agreement with the crystallization sequence of hydrous andesite at P.0.2 GPa 50 (Figure 4). The association of Cu-Fe-sulphides with late-stage magnetite indicates that magnetite-induced sulphide saturation of the magma occurred after the high pressure Cu partitioning into the fluid phase. A partial fluid-to-sulphide melt transfer of Cu and S from the fluid phase into the sulphide melt formed in the boundary layer around magnetite crystals could have been prompted by the preferential aggregation of fluid bubbles to crystallising magnetite 51 . Alternatively, Cu hosted by Cu-sulphides could have been derived from the residual Cu present in the melt after fluid partitioning at high pressure.",

They have exsolved fluids by decompression at shallow levels, likely below the single-phase fluid field (vapour1liquid: Figure 4). Cusulphides trapped in empty inclusions of plagioclases (Figures 2c-f) record the shallow level exsolution from the magma of a Cu-bearing, mostly vapour-rich fluid. However, vapour exsolution at shallow levels is not considered to be favourable for large porphyry Cu formation 53 . This is due to the fact that vapours are easily dispersed to the atmosphere at these shallow levels and have metal concentrations generally too low to form economic deposits 53 . Large porphyry deposits are usually considered to be formed by a single-phase fluid of variably low salinity exsolved at deeper levels 1, 53 .",

All these processes occurred at pressures at which amphibole preceded plagioclase crystallization (,0.4 GPa at Pilavo). In andesite and basaltic andesite magmas amphibole precedes plagioclase fractionation above a pressure threshold (,0.2 GPa), which roughly coincides with the vapour1liquid coexistence lines of low to intermediate salinity fluids (Figure 4). It follows that andesitic magmas that develop high Sr/Y signatures through high-pressure (.,0.2 GPa) crystallization of amphibole will exsolve a single-phase fluid when they reach fluid saturation (Figure 4). Our results show that Cu may efficiently partition into this single-phase fluid exsolved from an andesitic oxidized magma crystallizing at depth, before sulphide saturation.",

            "text": "Fluid saturation in magmas evolving at deep levels, which are therefore likely to develop high Sr/Y signatures, has already been proposed as a solution to the conundrum of excess sulfur released during many volcanic arc eruptions 45 . Our data suggest that oxidized, high Sr/Y magmas formed through mid-crustal fractionation 6 crustal melting and assimilation likely coexist at depth with an excess fluid containing not only S but also Cu. The evidence of a Cu-bearing excess fluid in the higher Sr/Y andesitic magmas of Pilavo reconciles into a coherent model of porphyry systems: (i) the idea that shallow porphyry systems are fed by Cu-bearing fluids escaping periodically from a deep mafic/intermediate reservoir and/or advected with the magma itself 32,33 , and (ii) the spatial-temporal association of porphyry systems with high Sr/Y magmas (see above). In this model cyclic replenishments of the deep reservoir by mafic recharges may cause cyclic fluid saturation through high-pressure crystallization (see also 7 ). By this way fluid and metal flux from the deep maficintermediate reservoir may continue for prolonged time because deep reservoirs are more easily kept at mature thermal conditions by recharge processes than shallow ones. This results in a long-lived, continuous fertilization of the shallow magmatic-hydrothermal systems 7,8 and is consistent with the long hydrothermal life of giant porphyry systems (e.g. 54 ). During this time, and depending on crustal stress conditions, the high Sr/Y signature may also be episodically transferred to shallower levels by magma pulses ascending from the deep reservoir. This may cause the frequent, but not universal, association of high Sr/Y magmatic rocks with large porphyry systems.",

Mag5magnetite) in water-saturated basaltic andesite (band) and andesite (and) magma buffered at NNO11 to NNO12 (from 21 ; for simplicity the boundaries of clinopyroxene and olivine have been omitted). Also shown are the solubility curves of a fluid (75 mol.% H 2 O, 25 mol.% CO 2 ) in a basaltic magma calculated with VolatileCalc1_1 58 , the projected vapour1liquid coexistence surface for salinities of 10 wt.% and 30-45 wt.% NaCl (green, extrapolated above 1000uC) and the vapour1liquid1halite coexistence curve (blue) from 59 (V5vapour, L5liquid, H5halite, F5single-phase fluid). The orange path 1 represents a hypothetical fluid-unsaturated (e.g., H 2 O52.5 wt.%) basaltic andesite/ andesite magma that ascends rapidly to shallow level until it becomes fluidsaturated upon hitting the 2.5 wt.% H 2 O boundary. This magma will exsolve a fluid below the vapour1liquid coexistence line and will not have significantly high Sr/Y because it will not fractionate amphibole. If the same magma undergoes isobaric crystallization at P. ,0.2 GPa (red paths 2) it will eventually become fluid-saturated in the single-phase fluid field, above the vapour1liquid coexistence line. Because amphibole always precedes plagioclase crystallization above the vapour1liquid coexistence line in andesitic magmas and almost at any pressure above the V1L coexistence line for basaltic andesite magmas (except a small gap between ,0.19 and ,0.22 GPa), it follows that development of high Sr/Y signatures and exsolution of fluids in the single phase field are intimately bound together. Hydrous andesitic magmas rising rapidly to shallow levels have magnetite close to the liquidus (orange path 1), which might cause sulphide saturation before fluid exsolution, depending on the initial water content of the magma. In contrast, andesitic magmas evolving at P.0.2 GPa and thus acquiring high Sr/Y signatures (red paths 2) will crystallize magnetite late thus making possible the partitioning of Cu into an exsolved fluid before magnetite-induced sulphide saturation incorporates magmatic Cu.",

Apart from the Cu-Fe sulphide phases no other mineral phases are visible in these ''empty'' inclusions. Additionally, we did not observe salt deposits within and/or around the broken inclusions, which would have formed by sudden evaporation of a saline fluid at the moment of the hammerinduced opening of the inclusions(Figures 2b-cand Supplementary Material 4). We consider this as an indirect evidence for a low-salinity, vapour-rich nature of the fluid of these inclusions. Only in one case we observed a possible salt deposit around a broken fluid inclusion containing a Cu-Fe-sulphide(Figure bof Supplementary Material 4). This might suggest the occurrence also of some saline fluid inclusions.",

The images show fluid/melt inclusion-rich zones within plagioclase phenocrysts (a) with abundant empty fluid inclusions (b) and the occurrence of Cu-Fesulphides within some of them (c-d). The most common occurrence of Cu-Fe-sulphides is that of Figure 2c (see Supplementary Material 4 for additional pictures). Apart from the Cu-Fe-sulphide phase (c) no other mineral phases are visible in these inclusions. Additionally within and around the inclusions we never observed salt deposits that might have formed upon hammer-induced rupture of the fluid inclusions if these contained saline fluids. This suggests that the inclusions are low-salinity, essentially vapour-rich.
