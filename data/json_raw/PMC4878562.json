The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of various antigens, including \u03b1-synuclein (Syn) and its post-translational modified forms, in the human colon at various ages. In addition, the study aimed to correlate the expression of Syn with neurodegeneration. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of neurofilament (NF), Syn, as well as its nitrated (N) form in the healthy colonic tissue of 12 young (34.08\u00b15.12 years), 10 middle-aged (51.80\u00b13.52 years), and 11 elderly (75.82\u00b17.70 years) individuals. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate the presence of N-Syn in the colonic tissue. N-Syn was identified in the upper layer of the mucosa and submucosa layer. Furthermore, Syn (wild-type) was present in the mucosa and submucosa. The number of NF-positive neurons in the submucosal layer declined significantly with age (P<0.01). In addition, Syn and N-Syn significantly increased during aging (P<0.01). Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between neuron number and synucleinopathies, indicating the abnormal accumulation of both wild-type Syn and N-Syn in the mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer and myenteric plexus. The present study demonstrates that the Syn pathology may be linked to colic neuronal degeneration during normal aging, and this link may cause functional deficits.",

Thus, disorders of the colon, such as constipation, are more prevalent with age (1,2). However, the majority of studies regarding the disruption of colonic motility have been reported in animals (3). Therefore, it is unclear whether the increased prevalence of constipation with age in humans is due to confounding factors or age-associated abnormalities in the nerves and muscles of the colon.",

These aggregates are involved in synucleinopathies, which occur predominantly in the elderly human brain (9,10). A previous report has demonstrated that certain autonomic axons in the wall of the intestinal tract are immunopositive for wild-type and phosphorylated Syn (8).

Previous studies have identified that an oligomer-promoting effect of serine 129 phosphorylation is key in Syn neurotoxicity and inclusion formation (13). Furthermore, studies have shown that N-Syn is prone to oligomerization (14) and promotes dopaminergic loss of neurons in culture (14,15). Therefore, the present study hypothesizes that Syn, as well as N-Syn, may participate in age-associated colonic neurodegeneration. In addition, it was hypothesized that neurodegeneration of Syn and N-Syn causes functional movement disorders, which commonly occur in elderly individuals. In the current study, Syn and its post-translational modifications (PTMs) were investigated in colonic tissue samples obtained from individuals of different ages to determine which types are specific to the colon. Furthermore, the study aimed to determine whether these PTMs correlate with neurodegeneration during normal aging. Thus, these results may provide information on the processes underlying normal aging, which may in turn be involved in pathological aging.",

In the young, middle-aged, and elderly groups, immunoreactivity for Syn was observed in all five layers: The mucosa, submucosa, inner circular muscle, myenteric plexus, and outer longitudinal muscle (Fig. 2). As the expression profile in the inner circular muscle and outer longitudinal muscle was similar, these two groups were combined and the cell number was calculated. Double-staining indicated that the positively-stained cells were neurons (Fig. 3) or glial cells (Fig. 4). Syn was identified in the nucleus, cytoplasm and axons (Fig. 3). In young individuals, axons immunoreactive for Syn were typically smooth in appearance (Fig. 3). However, in the elderly group, axons were densely distributed with a swollen appearance along their length (Fig. 3). Furthermore, Syn-positive terminals surrounded the colonic glands and neurons in the ganglia. The number of Syn-positive cells was low in the young (30.50\u00b15.99) and middle-aged (51.00\u00b110.22) groups; however, was significantly greater (120.36\u00b131.10; P<0.05) in the elderly individuals (Fig. 2). These immunoreactive cells were regionally distributed, with 12.01, 10.13, 56.89, and 20.91% located in the mucosa, submucosa, muscle and myenteric plexus, respectively.

A negative correlation was also identified between the number of myenteric plexus neurons and wild-type Syn in the muscle layer (r=-0.742) and the myenteric plexus (r=-0.641).

Neurodegeneration of the ENS may be the key to these functional changes that are observed with advancing age. Studies have demonstrated that deficits in intestinal function are linked with age-associated loss of enteric neurons in rats (20), guinea pigs (21) and humans (22). Previous reports indicated that age-associated cell loss in the myenteric plexus occurs exclusively in the cholinergic (i.e. excitatory) enteric neurons, but not in nitrergic (i.e. inhibitory) neurons (20). However, the majority of studies have not investigated the underlying mechanisms of neuronal vulnerability with increasing age. The present study has demonstrated age-associated loss of submucosal and myenteric neurons in the ascending colon. In addition, the expression pattern of wild-type Syn and its PTMs were investigated to elucidate the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration.",

Furthermore, the results suggest that during the aging process, nitration of Syn initially occurs in the mucosa and submucosa, and subsequently in the muscle and myenteric plexus. The common characteristic of the various PTM forms of Syn in the mucosa was a predominant distribution in the surface layer. This layer is in closer contact with environmental toxins in the colon lumina. Little or no Syn was observed in the deep mucosa. In the elderly group, the staining density intensified, and axons were swollen, particularly in the wild-type Syn. The dendrites became shorter, thicker and twisted. A previous study identified that pathological accumulation of Syn in neurons may hinder axonal-stromal transport due to disturbances in nerve conduction (27). Furthermore, previous reports suggest that nerve terminal degeneration may precede degeneration of ganglia neurons or even cell death during these pathological processes (28). Studies have shown a significant age-associated loss of submucosal intrinsic sensory neurons in the rat distal colon (2,3). Another report has suggested that a reduced input to enteric microcircuits may result in reduced motility (29).",

            "text": "Environmental-mediated induction of metabolized proteins and reactive oxygen species have been shown to be involved in neurodegeneration (30). Based on the results of the current study, regarding the temporal and spatial patterns of Syn in colonic tissue, it was proposed that age-associated infiltration of Syn and its PTM forms through the damaged mucosal barrier of the tract allows their access to axons. This effect may be due to the marked neuronal innervation in the mucosa (31). Reactive oxygen species have been shown to facilitate phosphorylation (32,33) and nitration (34), stabilize Syn protofibrils and delay their fibrillar formation (35). The accumulation of Syn may reduce mitochondrial Complex I activity, thus interfering with its function (36), it may also lead to further damage from increased oxidative stress and free radicals, thereby causing death of neurons (37). Thus, the environmental toxins may specifically affect those neurons that innervate the mucosa or submucosa, as the terminals of these neurons are located in the vicinity of the compromised epithelium. In addition, Syn may be continuously transmitted from one neural system to another via endocytosis (38); this effect may result in the accumulation of Syn, thereby causing neurodegeneration. In the elderly population, if the threshold of neuronal death in the colon is reached, colonic dysmotility and decreased secretory activity may lead to the clinical response of constipation. A previous study has indicated that the level of accumulated Syn during constipation is markedly higher when compared with that of a control group (25).",
