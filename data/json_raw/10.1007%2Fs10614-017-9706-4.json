            "text": "The importance of network externalities for the development of technology and industry structure has been recognized in evolutionary economic for a long time. However, network externalities are no isolated phenomena. They are based on competing standards in a comprehensive network of technology lines that are based on one another and remain to various degrees interoperable or compatible. As some evidence from the ICT sector inparticular shows, compatibility and tying or bundling of standards may be employed as strategic tools. The present paper investigates the economic role of tied standards for the dynamics of competition between standards. A replicator model operating on an aggregated level is complemented by an agentbased simulation with explicit representation of the network structure among users. A variety of effects are studied, including the role of initial usage share, manipulation of compatibility, expansion of vendors into other segments, as well as the network structure and central or peripheral positioning of agents. The agent-based model contrasts a complete network and a regular ring network with asymmetric network structures derived from Barab\u00e0si and Albert's preferential attachment mechanism and triadic closure.",

While many standards 1 may be available in theory, practical usability depends on which standard predominates the users' direct environment, which ones are used by their business partners etc. This effect, network externalities, has extensively been investigated (David 1985;Katz and Shapiro 1985;Arthur et al. 1987). However, there is a second constraint, introduced by compatibility to other standards already employed by the respective users; they may for instance need to consider, if the desired VoIP software works well with the used operating system, office software, computer and network hardware, etc. Network externalities will then develop not only within but also across segments.",

Another well-known case linked to the company is the bundling of its operating system Windows with its web browser Internet Explorer. Today, many large companies in the ICT (information and communication technology) sector maintain extensive portfolios of partly bundled or integrated products. While the phenomenon is by no means limited to the ICT sector, the strength of network externalities in ICT makes examples in this sector both more numerous and more obvious. 2 Obvious strategies to gain an advantage for a competing standard in such a setting include increasing the compatibility with major competitors in other segments, 3 introducing spin-off standards in other segments, and reducing compatibility with weaker competitor's products in order to drive them out of business.",

A standard replicator equation is used in which the compatibility with and the usage shares of standards in one or several other segments take the role of the evolutionary fitness.

Therefore, it is necessary to show that benchmark models operating at an aggregated level will still work if a micro-layer of massive numbers of interacting agents is included. For this, an agent-based version of the model is added. The deterministic dynamics resulting from the (aggregated level) replicator model are replaced by transition probabilities between user groups of standards. 5 For the trivial network structure of a complete graph, this results in a stochastic dynamic system which is equivalent to the macro-level model in its behavior while for other network structures, the probabilities change locally, i.e. between agents, depending on their neighborhood.",

            "text": "While there were some earlier considerations of increasing returns in economic theory (see, e.g. Sraffa 1926;Young 1928), the specific role of increasing returns to the number of consumers, and thus the phenomenon of network externalities, was only analyzed in detail starting in the 1980s. 6 There are two major schools to approach the modeling of network externalities: One relies on game theory and the analysis of equilibria for rational agents in a game theoretic setting. This approach was pioneered by Shapiro (1985, 1986). It received much attention and drew a large number of contributions in the subsequent years; Farrell and Klemperer (2007) provide an overview. The other line of research emphasized path dependence, self-reinforcing feedbacks, and dynamics. Nelson's (1968) and Fisher and Pry's (1971) models of technological change may, without directly focusing on network externalities, have been the first predecessor of this class of models. The tradition of literature fully developed in the 1980s with David's (1985David's ( , 1992 historical analyses and Arthur et al.'s (1983Arthur et al.'s ( [1982Arthur et al.'s ( ], 1987Arthur et al.'s ( , 1988Arthur et al.'s ( , 1989) urn scheme (Eggenberger-P\u00f3lya process) models. The consensus among the two traditions holds that network effects tend to lead to a lock-in with only one alternative as the uncontested standard which may bring certain disadvantages in the form of technological alternatives that are not viable any more because the user base concentrates on another, potentially inferior technology. 7 As the body of literature and evidence grew, scholars turned to further details including tying of standards across sectors, or rather across subsectors/segments within a larger sector. As an example, this may be thought of as an operating system, an office software package, a web browser, a database system and numerous other categories of software and hardware products that require a certain compatibility with one another in order to work properly. 8 Many of the larger vendors are active in several or almost all of these subsectors. It is obvious that network externalities may also unfold indirectly 9 across sectors and that it opens a large variety of strategic options to any commercial vendor. The idea of tied standards was initially proposed by Choi (2004) and analyzed in a game theory framework. Later, an evolutionary replicator model was put forward (Heinrich 2014); this model will be used and extended for the analysis in the present article.",

The properties of other network structures in this respect including lattice networks, Watts-Strogatz random graphs (i.e., small world networks), and scale free networks (both Barab\u00e0si-Albert preferential attachment networks and and Vazquez' connect nearest neighbor (CNN) networks) were investigated subsequently (Delre et al. 2007;Lee et al. 2006;Frenken et al. 2008;Uchida and Shirayama 2008;Pegoretti et al. 2009). It was found that networks with large diameter effectively inhibited complete lock-in (Uchida and Shirayama 2008). Small world networks on the other hand 10 resemble the findings of the complete network (Delre et al. 2007;Lee et al. 2006;Pegoretti et al. 2009). Some of the findings by Uchida and Shirayama (2008) also hint that clustering (CNN instead of BA scale free networks) may reduce the probability of a lock-in as well.",

Barab\u00e0si-Albert preferential attachment networks with triadic closure Since realworld networks tend to be highly clustered, something which is not the case for Barab\u00e0si-Albert networks, clustering is increased here by using triadic closure. m open triads, unconnected nodes which have a common neighbor, are randomly selected and closed. The parameter setting used in the simulations below is k = 1, N = 1000, m = 1000 which gives the network as many edges as network (3) but a larger diameter. Note that triadic closure is similar to V\u00e1zquez' (2003) connect nearest neighbor (CNN) network generating mechanism: as nodes of higher degree are more likely to be selected, this should increase the asymmetry of the degree distribution (and indeed combine two power-law generating mechanisms). 5.

The indirect effect works through the shifts in the other segment (lower panel). The answer to the question-should the compatibility be reduced-consequently depends on the time frame across which the standard vendor attempts to maximize their usage shares. In the immediate future, the direct effect dominates (thus, compatibility should be decreased), after some time, this may be offset by indirect effect (thus, compatibility should be left as high as it is if this time frame is the relevant one).

This may serve as a neutral benchmark case in which no strategic use of the positioning in the network is made; effect 9 changes this assumption and studies an example of strategical use of the network structure for the positioning of early adopters. The share of early adopters is more closely studied in effect 8. her adoption decisions, i.e. with N = 1000 agents and t max = 10000 time steps, the average agent will reevaluate her decision 10 times. As seen below, this leads to a rather slow development compared to what is to be expected in the real world and compared to the replicator dynamic above. Figure 10 shows the result of 9 example runs in a complete network for 9 different initial relative shares of the second segment while the first segment is divided p 1,0 = 0.6 0.4 for all 9 runs. The simulations show that the monopolization towards the pair of tied standards with the larger overall usage share as predicted above does occur and that it does occur in both segments. This was to be expected since the complete network was used in this case. Results for all network structures under consideration here (for 100 runs per setting) are shown in a more compressed form (not the entire development, just the final usage shares) in Fig. 8. As would be expected, the resulting curve is s-shaped with very asymmetric starting distributions converging to monopolization much quicker; the effect can be reproduced for all network structures.

The effects are strongest in the case of the complete network (diagrams A) and the regular grid (diagrams B).

The effect is clearly detectable but with a lot of variation. In the center, the clear s-shape of the curve does not appear to emerge in these cases.

The \"paradox\" refers to the phenomenon that an agent's neighbors (\"friends\") in a network with asymmetric degree distribution do on average have more neighbors and are thus more central. To study this effect, the competition between two standards, one with and one without the benefits of this phenomenon, is considered. The standard with the benefits of this effect selects random neighbors of arbitrarily chosen agents as initial adopters (Fig. 13). Unsurprisingly, it is found to have no effect in the network structures with homogeneous degree distributions (complete network and regular grid, A and B). For all other network structures, this leads to the s-shaped curve being changed to a concave one with the lower end (low initial shares) being inflated upwards. Hence, a network of moderately high to high final usage shares results from well-connected initial adopters. It should be noted that commercial vendors frequently seek to employ such a strategy (trying to win over more well-connected individuals first) by approaching institutions like universities with favorable contracts etc.",

            "text": "While the literature does not offer any previous models on strategic use of network externalities and market power in the case of tied standards, there is a small literature tradition on product bundling (Choi 2004;Nalebuff 2004;Miao 2010; Eisenmann et al. ) and there are some empirical observations that strongly imply the systematic employment of such strategies. This section will discuss a few examples from the ICT sector. Luksha (2008) recounts several cases of cooptation of organizational networks (supplier networks, user networks) by a dominant firm for its own purposes. His examples include Microsoft as the dominant player in the PC operating systems' segment forcing cooperation between the two major competitors in the PC processor segment (which is clearly tied to PC operating systems), Intel and AMD. Luksha also identifies firms that actively shape and coordinate their user networks, namely Sun (then the vendor of a wide array of IT products including Java, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris), Google, and Intel. Luksha does not go into detail on this, but it is clear that this activity is targeted on entrenching and extending the dominant position and the usage shares of the various products. This can be done by bundling products (across tied segments), particularly, in case of firms that offer a wide variety of related products like Sun (at the time), Google, Apple, and Microsoft. It can also be accomplished by acquiring more well-connected users (say, university students and faculty) and perhaps by coercing the help of prominent institutions (say, by offering special deals to universities)-in fact, aggressive marketing to otherwise privileged user groups is rather common. The case of Sun's Java offers a prime example of a huge marketing campaign that was run to position the new standard in the mid 1990s, probably in full awareness of the intricacies of network externalities (Garud et al. 2002). Further, many successful commercial ICT standards started out by securing a temporary bundling or at least a licensing cooperation with one of the major players in a tied subsector: Microsoft's success in the 1980s came after (and as a direct consequence of) its alliance with IBM in the 1970s; one of the first strategic actions of Sun's deployment of Java in 1995 was a licensing agreement with Microsoft (Garud et al. 2002); the three successful mobile operating systems (Android, iOS, Windows Mobile) were established by major vendors of other (tied) standards, the Google search engine (in combination with other Google online services) in case of Android and PC operating systems in case of Apple's iOS and Microsoft's Windows Mobile. Sure enough, they swiftly displaced the early mobile operating systems by less well-positioned vendors, such as Blackberry and Symbian (West and Mace 2010). 30 More recently there has been speculation about which segment is likely to determine the future development of the ongoing mobile device platform competition with some scholars arguing that attracting third-party developers is the most important aspect (Ghazawneh and Henfridsson 2013) while others contend that mobile online services (app stores, integration with social networks) play a crucial role compared to more traditional (software and hardware) segments (Kenney and Pon 2011). Specifically, the platforms that emerged as superior, Apple iOS, Google Android, and Windows Mobile were identified as those able to generate revenue in those services. An interesting strategy may be that of Google, which generates its revenue and the network externalities crucial in keeping the platform competitive in entirely different segments (Kenney and Pon 2011). Note, however, that this particular analysis in Kenney and Pon (2011) does not place too much value on the integration of and compatibility among the segments; as the simulations above suggest, this may be another crucial effect, which may be at the bottom of the success of the tightly closed Apple platform.",

Strategic approaches would also not attempt positioning in the entire network (hence, the entire world) at once but focus on specific niches, niches that are large enough to form an installen base but clustered to withstand outside influences by other competitors.
