            "text": "A \u03b2-glucan synthase gene was isolated from the genomic DNA of polypore mushroom Sparassis crispa, which reportedly produces unusually high amount of soluble \u03b2-1,3-glucan (\u03b2-glucan). Sequencing and subsequent open reading frame analysis of the isolated gene revealed that the gene (5,502 bp) consisted of 10 exons separated by nine introns. The predicted mRNA encoded a \u03b2-glucan synthase protein, consisting of 1,576 amino acid residues. Comparison of the predicted protein sequence with multiple fungal \u03b2-glucan synthases estimated that the isolated gene contained a complete N-terminus but was lacking approximately 70 amino acid residues in the C-terminus. Fungal \u03b2-glucan synthases are integral membrane proteins, containing the two catalytic and two transmembrane domains. The lacking C-terminal part of S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase was estimated to include catalytically insignificant transmembrane \u03b1-helices and loops. Sequence analysis of 101 fungal \u03b2-glucan synthases, obtained from public databases, revealed that the \u03b2-glucan synthases with various fungal origins were categorized into corresponding fungal groups in the classification system. Interestingly, mushrooms belonging to the class Agaricomycetes were found to contain two distinct types (Type I and II) of \u03b2-glucan synthases with the type-specific sequence signatures in the loop regions. S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase in this study belonged to Type II family, meaning Type I \u03b2-glucan synthase is expected to be discovered in S. crispa. The high productivity of soluble \u03b2-glucan was not explained but detailed biochemical studies on the catalytic loop domain in the S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase will provide better explanations.",

Chitin is a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine linked through \u03b2-1,4-glycosidic bonds. In the case of filamentous fungi, chitin accounts for 10~20% of the total dry weight. Chitin polymers form microfibril structures through intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and the microfibrils enclose the cell membrane to maintain cell integrity. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three chitin synthases (Chs1, Chs2, and Chs3) are involved in the biosynthesis of chitin [1]. \u03b2-Glucan, a predominant cell wall component, is a polymer of glucose linked through \u03b2-1,3-glycosidic bonds.",

Membrane-bound Rho I GTPase is known to regulate the activity of Fks1 and Fks2 as a regulatory subunit [2]. In fungi, \u03b2-glucan synthase is encoded by a corresponding gene with the size of 56 kbp, which expresses a large protein with a size of ~200 kDa [3,4]. \u03b2-Glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, which consists of two cytosolic domains (C1 and C2) and two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2). In the case of Fks1, the catalytic C2 domain is located in the cytoplasmic side of membrane linked to the two TM domains. TM1 and TM2 are composed of six and seven transmembrane \u03b1-helices, respectively [5].",

Cultivated mushrooms, Pleurotus ostreatus, P. eryngii, P. pulmonarius, and L. edodes, consist of 0.6~1.5% soluble \u03b2-glucan on a dry weight basis [13]. The content can vary according to the cultivation conditions, such as the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the substrate, pH, and culture temperature [14]. Interestingly, polypore mushroom Sparassis crispa has been reported to contain an unusually high amount of soluble \u03b2-glucan (40% dry weight) in its fruiting body [15]. Hot water or alkali extract of S. crispa displays anti-tumor activity and stimulates hematopoietic responses [16]. S. crispa is a parasitic and saprotrophic mushroom, growing on the roots or basis of oak or conifer trees. It is also considered to be a brown-rot fungus since it does not produce lignin-degrading enzyme [17]. This mushroom has drawn much attention as a soluble \u03b2-glucan producer, but further study has been impeded due to its extremely slow growth rate. As an alternative, the production of \u03b2-glucan through mycelial culture has been recently examined by introducing a high \u03b2-glucan producing mutant strain [18].",

As a result, the \u03b2-glucan synthase gene was found to consist of 10 exon sequences separated by nine introns. The predicted size of the mRNA was 4,728 bp. The mRNA encoded a polypeptide consisting of 1,576 amino acid residues. Since mushroom \u03b2-glucan synthases of this type are generally composed of 1,6401 ,650 amino acid residues, the S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase in this study is estimated to be devoid of approximately 70 amino acids at its C-terminus. However, the protein regions critical for enzyme function, including the active site, are mostly contained within the 1,500 amino acid residues for fungal \u03b2-glucan synthase [5]. The amino acid sequence for S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase is estimated to carry most of the information required for the analysis of enzyme function.",

            "text": "Fungal \u03b2-glucan synthase is an integral membrane protein, consisting of two cytosolic and two transmembrane domains [1,23]. Topology of S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase was analyzed by the Phobius program to predict the functional domain regions. As shown in Fig. 2A, S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase was predicted to consist of 15 loops (L1~L15) and 14 transmembrane \u03b1-helices (H1~H14). Catalytic domains C1 and C2, homologous to Fks1, were found in L1 and L9, respectively. The two domains were separated by the transmembrane domain TM1, which was shown to comprise eight transmembrane \u03b1-helices (H1~H8). TM2, composed of six transmembrane \u03b1-helices (H7~H14), was located at the C-terminus of the protein (Fig. 2B). The large loop structures L1, L9, and L11 with lengths of 367, 573, and 143 aa, respectively, were located at the cytosolic side of the membrane, implying their function in the synthesis of \u03b2-glucan. In the yeast homologue Fks1, the L9 loop was reported to play a critical role in enzyme catalysis [24]. Mutations in the core catalytic regionof the Fks1 L9 loop, ranging 830~1,050 aa, caused more than 80% reduction in catalytic activity, as shown by the mutant strains fks1-1144 (L872F, E907K, N982S) and fks1-1154 (K877N, A899S, Q977P) [25]. The L9 loop of S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase was highly homologous to that of Fks1 (Fig. 3). The amino acid residues reported to affect the catalytic activity of Fks1 were well conserved in S. crispa \u03b2-glucan synthase (Fig. 3, shaded amino acids).",

However, these enzymes are highly homologous proteins and do not belong to any type of Agaricomycetes \u03b2-glucan synthase. The L9 catalytic loop regions for both enzymes are virtually identical, implying that both enzymes may have similar catalytic activity. FKS1 is primarily expressed in the vegetative growth, whereas FKS2 is expressed under stress conditions, including starvation, sporulation, and mating [26]. Therefore, S. cerevisiae \u03b2-glucan synthases are catalytically identical but functionally independent enzymes. Mushrooms belonging to Agaricomycetes express two types of \u03b2-glucan synthases, that are potentially different in terms of catalytic activity as suggested by different amino acid arrangements in the catalytic loop region, may function in different developmental stages. Transcriptome analyses of A. bisporus H97 in different developmental stages have shown that Type II \u03b2-glucan synthase (XP_006458137, a homologue of EKM78523) was constantly expressed throughout the developmental stages whereas Type I \u03b2-glucan synthase (XP_006455356, a homologue of EKM82691) was highly expressed in the fruiting body stage [27].
