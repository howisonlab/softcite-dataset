For instance, tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) strongly correlates with transcriptional activity and is regulated by the Bur1/2 kinase complex. We found that the evolutionarily conserved Ccr4-Not complex is involved in establishing H3K4 tri-methylation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed synthetic lethal interactions of Ccr4-Not components with BUR1 and BUR2. Further analysis indicated that the genes encoding the Not-proteins are essential for efficient regulation of H3K4me3, but not H3K4me1/2, H3K36me2 or H3K79me2/3 levels. Moreover, regulation of H3K4me3 levels by NOT4 is independent of defects in RNA polymerase II loading. We found NOT4 to be important for ubiquitylation of histone H2B via recruitment of the PAF complex, but not for recruitment or activation of the Bur1/2 complex. These results suggest a mechanism in which the Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to or downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase to facilitate H3K4me3 via PAF complex recruitment.",

            "text": "Efficient transcription in eukaryotes requires interplay between the RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription machinery and factors regulating modification of the chromatin (reviewed in: 1). Tri-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) occurs co-transcriptionally (2) and is strongly correlated with transcriptional activity (3). H3K4 methylation is mediated by the Set1p histone methyltransferase (HMT) complex in yeast (4)(5)(6)(7). In recent years, several factors required for this modification have been identified. It is now apparent that ubiquitylation of histone H2B is necessary for methylation of H3K4 by Set1p (8,9) and of H3K79 by Dot1p (10).",

This CDK-cyclin pair can phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II in vitro (13), but it does not seem to contribute to CTD phosphorylation in vivo (14). This kinase complex is required for H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 tri-methylation (15), which may involve direct phosphorylation of Rad6p (16). Interestingly, mono-and di-methylation of H3K4 are not affected by BUR1/2 mutations (15). Like the Bur1/2 complex, the PAF complex is implicated in transcription elongation and is essential for efficient H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 methylation, but not for recruitment of Rad6p (17,18). The PAF complex consists of five subunits (Paf1p, Rtf1p, Ctr9p, Leo1p and Cdc73p) and interacts with pol II (19,20). BUR2 is required for efficient PAF complex recruitment to chromatin, but the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear (15,16).",

The genes encoding the Not-proteins (NOT1-5) were initially identified as negative regulators of transcription initiation. Support for such a role was provided by the observation that several mutations in NOT genes suppress a temperature-sensitive allele of SRB4 (23), which encodes an essential subunit of the mediator co-activator complex (24). However, various reports also indicate a positive role for the Ccr4-Not complex (25)(26)(27). For example, this complex is required for transcription of RNR genes following DNA damage or replication stress (27). Genetic and physical interactions of Ccr4-Not complex components with transcription initiation and elongation factors have been described (reviewed in: 21,22). Besides this, Ccr4p and Caf1p represent the major mRNA deadenylases in yeast (28).",

Notably, deletion of the gene encoding Bur1p, the cyclin-dependent kinase partner of Bur2p, results in a strong growth defect and this strain was not represented in the library used for the genetic screen. To test a genetic interaction between NOT4 and BUR1 in a direct manner, we introduced a plasmid-based WT or temperature-sensitive mutant of BUR1 (bur1-23) into either NOT4 or not4D strains in which the sole copy of BUR1 was expressed from a URA3 plasmid (pRS316). Plasmid-shuffle analysis demonstrated synthetic lethality between a deletion of NOT4 and bur1-23 ( Figure 1B). Considering that the Bur1/2 complex was found to play a role in transcription elongation (13,14), not4D and bur2D strains were first tested for sensitivity to 6-AU. In agreement with observations linking the Ccr4-Not complex to transcription elongation (25), cells lacking NOT4 or BUR2 were 6-AU sensitive ( Figure 1C). Strikingly, a strict correlation was observed between the 6-AU sensitivity of Ccr4-Not gene deletions and synthetic lethality with BUR2 (25). This suggests that this synthetic lethality may be due to defects in transcription elongation. To extend these observations, we investigated requirement of NOT4 for transcription of a long and GC-rich reporter gene. This experimental setup has previously been used to study transcription elongation defects (29,35). Figure 1D shows that in cells lacking NOT4, the GAL1-promoterdriven LacZ reporter gene was inefficiently transcribed, whereas the endogenous GAL1 gene was expressed to WT levels. Taken together, these experiments show that Ccr4-Not complex components genetically interact with both BUR2 and BUR1 and confirm a role for this complex in transcription elongation (25).",

Under permissive conditions, both not1 alleles displayed a clear decrease in overall H3K4me3 levels (50-70% reduction as shown by quantification of the results), whereas growth of these cells was not affected. Moreover, deletion of NOT2, NOT4 or NOT5 reduced H3K4me3 levels (86-94% reduction; Figure 2B). In contrast, only a slight decrease in H3K4me2 levels was observed in these strains ( Figure  2B). It has been reported that Set1p complexes lacking Spp1p are unable to tri-methylate H3K4 (36,37). We found that deletion of NOT4 or NOT5 resulted in H3K4me3 levels comparable to deletion of SPP1 ( Figure 2C). In addition, H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 levels in extracts of CCR4-NOT deletion strains were essentially not affected ( Figure 2D), although a minor decrease in H3K79me2 in cells lacking NOT5 was observed. As expected, deletion of RAD6 led to a severe decrease in H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 levels (10).",

Notably, integrity of telomeric silencing was not affected by deletion of NOT4 (Figure 2E).

Using specific antibodies H3K4me3, H3K4me2, H3K36me2 and H3K79me2 levels at the 5 0 and the middle region of the PYK1 ORF were examined ( Figure  3A-E). Not4D cells displayed a clear decrease in the level of H3K4me3 at the 5 0 end of the PYK1 ORF compared to WT ( Figure 3B), whereas H3K4me2 levels were much less affected by deletion of NOT4 ( Figure 3C). Further analysis showed that H3K36me2 and H3K79me2 levels were not decreased in not4D cells (Figure 3D and E). In addition, pol II occupancy was determined using antibodies against the CTD of Rpb1p as a measure for transcriptional activity. In parallel, PYK1 and TUB1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR in WT and not4D cells. Both pol II association to the PYK1 ORF and PYK1 transcript levels were diminished in the absence of NOT4 (Figure 3F and G). Extending on these results, we determined the H3K4 methylation status of cells deleted for NOT2. Indeed, examination of not2D cells confirmed a requirement for NOT2 in the regulation of H3K4me3 specifically ( Figure 3H and I). Notably, essentially identical results were obtained when analyzing the PGK1 locus (data not shown), in line with a broader role for NOT4 in regulating H3K4me3 levels.",

Phenotypic analysis indicated that the Not4p-mycAVI fusion protein was fully functional (data not shown). Streptavidin-coated beads were used to capture the biotinylated Not4 proteins from chromatin extracts of cells containing either a plasmid expressing BirA or an empty vector. Interestingly, Not4p was detected on the 5 0 end of the PYK1 ORF and the region spanning the TATA box ( Figure 3J), coinciding with the region targeted for tri-methylation by the Set1p complex (see Figure 3B and H). Taken together, these ChIP experiments confirm the specificity of the H3K4me3 defect and indicate that Not4p is physically present on the 5 0 region of the PYK1 ORF. In addition, deletion of NOT4 resulted in decreased pol II occupancy and transcript levels, suggesting direct regulation of PYK1 expression by Not4p through tri-methylation of H3K4.",

In this light, the global decrease of H3K4me3 in cells lacking NOT4 could be a consequence of a global loss of RNA pol II CTD phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies against phosphorylated serine 2, serine 5 or total RNA pol II (H5, H14 and 8WG16, respectively) did not reveal a Figure 2. Specific requirement for the NOT genes for global H3K4 trimethylation. (A) Histone H3K4 mono-, di-and tri-methylation levels were determined in lysates from logarithmically growing BY4741-based CCR4-NOT gene deletion strains. Protein extracts of the indicated strains were separated by SDS-PAGE (15%) and subjected to western blotting using H3K4me1-, H3K4me2-and H3K4me3-specific antibodies. TBP levels were determined as a loading control. (B) MY1based NOT mutant strains were used to determine H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and total H3 levels as in (A). H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 levels were quantified using ImageQuant software and represented as relative to WT after normalization to total H3 levels.

This indicates that the role of NOT4 in regulating H3K4me3 levels is independent of RNA pol II phosphorylation. Arguably, the loss of H3K4 tri-methylation could be a consequence, rather than a cause, of decreased RNA pol II recruitment. To address this issue we investigated the HSP104 gene, which allowed determination of the level of H3K4me3 on a gene that is not decreased in transcription in not4D cells (data not shown). We observed a decrease of H3K4 tri-methylation of the promoter region of HSP104, albeit less pronounced than what was observed for PYK1 ( Figure 4A). In addition, we found a small increase in RNA pol II occupancy, which is in line with a slightly increased transcription rate ( Figure 4A and data not shown). Indeed, previous observations suggest that H3K4 methylation is not a critical determinant of HSP gene expression (41). In conclusion, this result shows that a decrease in H3K4me3 in not4D cells is not a consequence of decreased RNA pol II association per se.",

In addition, deletion of SPP1 gave rise to a decrease in mRNA levels reminiscent of deletion of NOT4 ( Figure 4B). Similar reductions of mRNA levels were observed for the PGK1 gene (data not shown). This suggests that the diminished PYK1 and PGK1 mRNA levels are a consequence of decreased H3K4 tri-methylation.

For instance, deletion of SPP1 results in the formation of a Set1p complex that is unable to trimethylate H3K4 (16). We investigated this by purifying the Set1p complex from WT and not4D strains via a TAPtagged version of the Bre2p subunit. In addition, we tested mRNA expression levels of Set1p complex subunits by northern blot analysis in strains containing or lacking NOT4. This indicated that neither transcript levels of its subunits nor composition of the Set1p complex are significantly affected by deletion of NOT4 ( Figure 5A  and B). Notably, the additional bands present in the purification from not4D cells were found to be non-specific lysosomal proteins (data not shown), which probably relates to differences in protein concentration between the extracts from WT or not4D cells. Using soluble histones as substrate in an in vitro HMT assay, no intrinsic defect in the methylation activity of Set1p complexes purified from not4D cells could be detected ( Figure 5C). In addition, (pre-methylated) synthetic peptides were used to determine whether Set1 complexes purified from not4D cells were active in tri-methylation of a di-methylated substrate. Notably, Set1 complexes from WT and not4D cells were equally efficient in modifying this synthetic peptide ( Figure 5D).",

Therefore, the H3K4me3 status was determined in cells expressing an inactive (L35A) mutant of Not4p as a measure for H2B ubiquitylation. The H3K4me3 defect of not4D cells was fully complemented by the L35A mutant of Not4p, suggesting that its RING-finger is not required for ubiquitylation of H2B ( Figure 6B).

Here, we show that the NOT genes, in contrast to CCR4 and the CAF genes, are required for global and gene-specific tri-methylation of H3K4 ( Figures 2, 3 and 4). In addition, we found that the Ccr4-Not complex is functionally linked to the Bur1/2 kinase complex (Figure 1), which is also specifically required for H3K4 tri-methylation (20). The mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex is involved in this histone modification is independent of direct regulation of the Set1p histone methyltransferase complex ( Figure 5). Instead, the Ccr4-Not complex functions parallel to or Figure 5. The H3K4me3 defect in not4D cells is independent of direct regulation of the Set1p complex. (A) mRNA levels of Set1p complex components. RNA was extracted from exponentially growing BY4741 and not4D and subjected to northern blot analysis using the indicated probes. (B) Subunit composition of purified Set1p complexes. Strains containing or lacking NOT4 and expressing a TAP-tagged Bre2p were used to purify Set1p complexes (upper panel). Equal expression of Bre2-TAP proteins was checked by western blot analysis (lower panel). The indicated proteins were identified using LC-MS/MS. Several additional proteins were present in the not4D purification when compared to the WT. Mass spectrometry showed that these bands contained non-related lysosomal proteins. We consider this an artifact of the purification, likely caused by differences in the concentration of the lysates of the WT and not4D cells. (C) Histone methyl transferase assay using purified Set1p complexes. Increasing amounts of Set1p complex or a mock-purification control were use to methylate soluble histones (from calf thymus) in vitro. Samples were separated on a 15% SDS-PAA gel, stained with Coomassie, dried and exposed to an X-ray film. (D) In vitro methylation of synthetic pre-methylated histone H3tail peptides. Pre-methylated peptides were used as substrates for in vitro methylation using Set1p complexes purified from WT or not4D cells.

The genetic interactions between genes encoding Ccr4-Not complex subunits (NOT2, NOT4 and CCR4) and BUR1 and BUR2, suggest a role for this complex in transcription elongation (Figure 1). Interestingly, deletions of several Ccr4-Not components were shown to exhibit 6-AU sensitivity, suggesting such a role (25). Notably, a strict correlation between the published 6-AU sensitivity for Ccr4-Not components and synthetic lethality with BUR2 was observed. Since the Bur1/2 complex was shown to be involved in the regulation of H3K4me3 levels (15), we determined the levels of various histone H3 lysine methylation marks in cells lacking genes encoding Ccr4-Not components. In contrast to the NOT-gene deletion strains, decreased H3K4me3 levels were not observed in ccr4D cells (Figure 2), suggesting that Ccr4p and the Not-module contribute to transcription elongation by distinct mechanisms. An alternative explanation could be that deletion of Ccr4-Not components and BUR2 results in partial loss of subsequent activities within the same pathway, ultimately resulting in the observed synthetic lethality.",

However, other modifications such as H3K4 mono-and di-methylation or H3K79 di-and trimethylation were not affected by deletion of NOT4. These results suggest a model in which the pathways leading to H3K4 and H3K79 methylation bifurcate upstream of the Ccr4-Not complex and are in agreement with a recent report showing that BUR2 is only required for H3K4 trimethylation (15,16). Alternatively, the residual degree of ubiquitylated H2B that is observed in cells lacking NOT4 may be sufficient to sustain H3K79me2/3 and H3K4me2, but not H3K4me3 levels. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that cells deleted for PAF1 show significant levels of H3K4 di-methylation but not tri-methylation (43, data not shown).",

            "text": "The Set1p complex (or COMPASS) represents the sole HMT for H3K4 in yeast (4-6). The observation that transcription, subunit composition, activity and specificity of the Set1p complex are not affected by Not4p suggests that the Ccr4-Not complex functions further upstream in a pathway regulating H3K4 tri-methylation. The finding that Not4p is physically present at the 5 0 region of the PYK1 ORF, coinciding with the H3K4 tri-methylation mark and the PAF complex, suggests a direct role for the Ccr4-Not complex in the regulation of this modification. Possibly, recruitment of the Ccr4-Not complex to this region aids localization of the H3K4me3 mark. Another important insight into the mechanism by which the Ccr4-Not complex controls H3K4me3 levels comes from the observation that PAF complex recruitment is severely decreased in the absence of NOT4, whereas Bur1p and Bur2p recruitment and activation are not affected Figure 7. The Ccr4-Not complex functions downstream of or parallel to the Bur1/2 kinase. (A) Bur1-HA and Bur2-HA are equally expressed in WT and not4D cells. Extracts of cells expressing HA-tagged Bur1p or Bur2p containing or lacking NOT4, or a non-tagged control, were subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies against the HA-tag, H3K4me3 and TBP. (B) Recruitment of the Bur1/2 complex to the PYK1 locus does not depend on NOT4. WT and not4D cells expressing HA-tagged Bur1p or Bur2p, and a no-tag control, were subjected to ChIP analysis using anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies (amplicons are schematically depicted in the upper panel). (C) As in (B), except that the analysis was performed for the PGK1 locus. (Figures 6 and 7). The Bur1/2 kinase is known to act upstream of PAF complex recruitment (15). Thus, the Ccr4-Not complex could either act downstream of the Bur1/2 kinase, or in a parallel pathway to regulate PAF complex recruitment (Figure 8). It is interesting to note that both Not3p and Not5p are phospho-proteins (44), but the connection with Bur1/2 complex remains unexplored. In the parallel pathway, the Bur1/2 and Ccr4-Not complexes would act independently of each other in the recruitment of the PAF complex to chromatin. Strikingly, deletion of BUR2 or NOT4 results in only a partial loss of H2B ubiquitylation, PAF complex recruitment and subsequent H3K4 tri-methylation (15, Figures 2 and 6).",

Intriguingly, this was also observed for deletions of CCR4-NOT genes (27) and deletion of BUR2 (data not shown), suggesting a functional interplay between these complexes. Alternatively, alteration of other components of the histone code might also contribute to the regulation of H3K4me3 levels by the Ccr4-Not complex.

These seemingly contradicting observations may be reconciled by recent findings of recognition of H3K4-methylated histones by PHD finger containing proteins (49)(50)(51). These domains are believed to recruit chromatin-modifying complexes, like NURF and the mSin3a-HDAC1 complex to H3K4-methylated chromatin (49,51). Yeast contains 15 PHD fingers residing in a variety of chromatin-modifying complexes and these motifs display different relative affinities for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 (50). Specific loss of H3K4 tri-methylation could therefore shift the balance of chromatin regulatory complexes at particular genes. It is unlikely that the sole function of the Ccr4-Not complex is regulation of H3K4 tri-methylation via recruitment of the PAF complex. Besides the well-documented role of the Ccr4p and Caf1p subunits in mRNA deadenylation, multiple observations indicate that the Not-proteins can directly affect TFIID function (reviewed in 21,22). This suggests that the Ccr4-Not complex integrates several steps of mRNA expression. The functional consequences of Ccr4-Not gene deletions are likely to be gene specific as suggested, for example, by our results on the PYK1 and HSP104 genes. Taken together, these findings provide an explanation for the observation that the Ccr4-Not complex can have both negative and positive effects on gene transcription.",

(B) Deletion of NOT4 or SPP1 lead to a similar decrease in H3K4me3 and transcript levels on the PYK1 gene. Chromatin extracts of BY4741, not4D and spp1D strains were subjected to ChIP analysis using H3K4me3-specific antibodies. PYK1 mRNA transcript levels are affected by deletion of NOT4 or SPP1. PYK1 mRNA in total RNA of BY4147, not4D and spp1D strains was analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR.",

Extracts of the indicated strains carrying a FLAG-HTB1 plasmid were separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to western blot analysis using FLAG antibodies. The lower panel shows a shorter exposure of the same blot, indicating equal loading. (B) The ubiquitin-ligase activity of Not4p is not involved in the regulation of H3K4me3 levels. The H3K4 methylation status in extracts from cells expressing NOT4 or not4L35A alleles from the endogenous NOT4 locus and cells lacking NOT4 were subjected to western blot analysis. (C) Ctr9-HA is equally expressed in NOT4 and not4D cells. Strains expressing HA-tagged Ctr9p, containing or lacking NOT4, were used to determine Ctr9-HA levels by western blotting. H3K4me3 and TBP levels were used as controls. (D and E) NOT4 is required for PAF complex recruitment to the PYK1 and PGK1 ORFs. Strains from (C) were subjected to ChIP analysis of the PYK1 locus (amplicons are schematically depicted in upper panel).
