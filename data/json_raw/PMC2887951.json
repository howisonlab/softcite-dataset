A total of 688 YgiP-binding loci were identified after genome-wide profiling of SELEX fragments with a high-density microarray (SELEX-chip). Gel shift and DNase-I footprinting assays indicated that YgiP binds to multiple sites along DNA probes with a consensus GTTNATT sequence. Atomic force microscope observation indicated that at low concentrations, YgiP associates at various sites on DNA probes, but at high concentrations, YgiP covers the entire DNA surface supposedly through protein-protein contact. The intracellular concentration of YgiP is very low in growing E. coli cells under aerobic conditions, but increases more than 100-fold to the level as high as the major nucleoid proteins under anaerobic conditions. An E. coli mutant lacking ygiP showed retarded growth under anaerobic conditions. High abundance and large number of binding sites together indicate that YgiP is a nucleoid-associated protein with both architectural and regulatory roles as the nucleoid proteins Fis and IHF. We then propose that YgiP is a novel nucleoid protein of E. coli under anaerobiosis and propose to rename it Dan (DNA-binding protein under anaerobic conditions).",

            "text": "The complete sequence of Escherichia coli genome has revealed the presence of 4453 protein-coding sequences shared between two laboratory strains, MG1655 and W3110, of K-12 lineage (1). The function of each gene product has been experimentally determined or computationally predicted for about half of the genes, but a large number of genes are still left uncharacterized (1) even though E. coli has long been used as a model organism in the modern molecular biology since its isolation (2). One major research subject of the post-genome sequencing era is the identification of physiological functions for all these uncharacterized genes. Most of these genes are, however, not expressed in laboratory culture conditions and thus supposed to be needed for the survival of E. coli under stressful conditions in nature. The expression of these uncharacterized stress-response genes must be under the control of stress-response regulatory systems. This line of research encounters with the difficulty that arises from the lack of knowledge about factors and conditions required for expression of each of these silent genes under laboratory culture conditions.",

            "text": "Transcription of the E. coli genome is considered to be under the control of approximately 300 species of transcription factors (3)(4)(5), which altogether control the distribution of about 2000 molecules of RNA polymerase among 4453 genes within the genome (3,5,6). The regulatory roles, however, remain unidentified for about 100 species of the transcription factor (5) presumably because those putative factors are needed for regulation of the genes, which are expressed in response to as-yet unidentified environmental stresses. Ordinary genetic approach is not useful without knowledge of factors and conditions for expression of their regulatory functions. To identify the regulatory roles of hitherto uncharacterized putative transcription factors, we have performed a systematic search for the identification of DNA sequences recognized by each of 300 species of DNA-binding transcription factors from E. coli by using the newly developed Genomic SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) system (7). Since the binding sites of prokaryotic transcription factors are generally located within or near the promoters, we can predict the target promoters, genes and operons from the binding site maps of test factors as have been successfully employed for Cra (7), RstA (8), PdhR (9), RutR (10), TyrR (11), NemR (12), AllR (13), CitB (14), LeuO (15) and AscG (16). Once the consensus recognition sequence is identified after genomic SELEX screening, the in silico search for other targets becomes possible using the information of whole genome sequence.",

            "text": "The LysR family of DNA-binding regulators exists in diverse bacterial genera, archea and algal chloroplasts, and participate in diverse cellular activities, including nitrogen fixation, oxidative stress response and bacterial virulence (17). Escherichia coli contains a total of 54 families of transcription factor, of which the LysR family is the most abundant including 45 members (4,5). LysR family proteins contain an N-terminal helix-turnhelix motif, but the consensus sequence of DNA binding is different between LysR family members, indicating that each controls a different set of genes or promoters with a unique recognition sequence. In this study, a systematic search was performed for identification of the target genes under the control of YgiP, an uncharacterized LysR-family transcription factor, by using this newly developed genomic SELEX system. In prokaryotes, the genes encoding transcription regulatory proteins are generally located on the genome adjoining to the target genes for regulation. Relying on this rule, Oshima and Biville (18) predicted that YgiP is involved in regulation of the adjacent ttdA-ttdB genes encoding tartrate dehydrogenase and propose to name YgiP as TtdR. After cloning-sequencing (SELEX-clos) and tilling array analysis (SELEX-chip) of SELEX fragments, however, we have obtained a large number of YgiP-binding sequences from hundreds of loci within the E. coli genome, including the ttdR-ttdA spacer sequence. After gel-shift and DNase-footprinting assays, YgiP was found to be a DNA-binding protein with affinity to AT-rich sequences. Both the number of binding sites on the genome and the sequence preference are similar to the known nucleoid proteins such as Fis and IHF (5,19,20). By using the quantitative immuno-blotting (21), we found the intracellular concentration of YgiP was very low in growing E. coli cells under aerobic conditions; however, under hypoxic or anaerobic culture conditions, the YgiP level increased more than 100-fold, reaching to the level as high as those of major nucleoid proteins HU and IHF. A mutant E. coli lacking ygiP showed retarded growth under anaerobic conditions. The binding mode of YgiP to DNA was investigated by atomic force microscory (AFM). These observations altogether indicate that YgiP has dual functions, playing the architectural role for genome folding and the global regulatory role in transcription of a number of genes, as in the case of the nucleoid proteins Fis and IHF. We then conclude that YgiP is a hitherto unidentified nucleoid protein in E. coli growing under anaerobic conditions, and propose to rename YgiP (or TtdR) to Dan (DNA-binding protein under anaerobic conditions), which belongs to the same family of growth phase-specific nucleoid proteins as Fis in exponential growth phase (22,23) and Dps in stationary phase (24).",

After digestion with NdeI and NotI, PCP products were cloned into pET21a(+) (Novagen) between NdeI and NotI sites. The plasmid construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, the pDan plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of Dan was induced by adding IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside). Purification of over-expressed His-tagged Dan was performed under the standard purification procedure (7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16).",

In brief, E. coli cells grown in 10 ml of either LB or M9-0.4% glucose medium under both aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.3 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol), and then lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. Total proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted on to a plyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using semi-dry transfer apparatus. Membranes were first immuno-detected with anti-Dan and then developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). The image was analyzed with a LAS-1000 Plus Lumino-Image Analyzer and Image Gauge (Fuji Film).",

In brief, cells were fixed by treatment with 80% methanol for 1 h at 25 C, and deposited on to a poly L-lysine-coated slide. After air drying, cells were treated with 2 mg/ml lysozyme solution at room temperature for 5 min. The slide was treated 99% methanol for 1 min, and then with acetone for 1 min until complete dryness. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 15 min for blocking, the sample was treated with 200-500-fold diluted anti-Dan antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated at room temperature for 1 h with 500-fold diluted goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with a fluorescence compound Cy3. After washing with Tween-containing PBS, the sample was treated with 10 ml of DAPI (4 0 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, 10 mg/ml) for 1 min for staining DNA, and covered with one drop of mountain medium (1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine and 90% glycerol in PBS, pH 9.0). The immuno-stained samples were observed with a fluorescence and phasecontrast microscope (100\u00c2objective lens; Olympus, Japan) equipped with a chilled, high sensitive digital CCD camera, Regita EXi (NIPPON ROPER, Japan), connected to a computer. Different filter cassettes were used for observation of Cy3 and DAPI fluorescence. The images were transferred directly to a Windows XP and processed using Image-Pro Plus version 6.0 software. The specificity of the observed immuno-stained fluorescent signal was verified by the absence of the signal in corresponding immuno-stained samples prepared using the respective dan null mutant cells.",

The 'Genomic SELEX' has since been successfully employed for identification of the sets of genes under the control of some known and unknown transcription factors (7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16). From a mixture of DNA fragments of E. coli K12 W3350 and a two-fold molar excess of the purified His-tagged Dan protein, Dan-DNA complexes were affinity purified using Ni-NTA resin. In the early stage of this genomic SELEX cycle, the Dan-bound DNA fragments formed smear bands on PAGE as did the original genome fragment mixture. After four and five SELEX cycles, however, the width of gel bands decreased, indicating certain enrichment of specific DNA fragments with Dan-binding activity. For sequence identification of Dan-bound DNA fragments, we first employed the cloning-sequencing method (SELEX-clos), in which the DNA fragment mixtures were recovered from the gels, PCR-amplified and subjected to the ordinary procedure of cloning and sequencing (7).",

The two different 297-bp-long segments overlapped in 63-bp sequence, indicating that the Dan-binding sequence is located within this narrow region of 63 bp in length.

This sequence with strong affinity to Dan is located upstream of its own gene and upstream of the divergently transcribed ttdAB genes encoding L-tartrate dehydratase. One possible function of Dan is the autogenous control of its own expression, but Dan may also play a regulatory role in expression of the neighboring and divergently transcribed ttdA-ttdB-ygjE operon as predicted based on the gene organization (18).

Most of the Dan-binding sites identified by the SELEX-clos analysis (see Supplementary Table 1) were included in the data collection of SELEX-chip analysis (see Supplementary  Table 2. Note that the genes identified by SELEX-clos are indicated by asterisk in Figure 1). In agreement with the results of SELEX-clos analysis, the signals were detected on both coding and non-coding sections of the E. coli genome ( Table 2). Of a total of 688 Dan-binding sites, 504 were located within intergenic non-coding regions (group-A) ( Table 2; for details see Supplementary Table 2A), while 184 were within coding regions (group-B) ( Table 2; for details see Supplementary  Table 2B). Even though the combination of total noncoding sequences is <10% of the whole E. coli genome, $80% of the Dan-binding sites are located within the non-coding sequences (Table 2). This supports the prediction that Dan plays a regulatory role of the genome function.",

With respect to the number of DNA-binding sites, Dan is different from the well-characterized global regulators so far examined by the genomic SELEX, including CRP, Cra, RstA, PdhR, RutR, TyrR, NemR, AllR and CitB (7-10,12,13). Instead Dan is rather similar to those of major nucleoid proteins such as HU, IHF, H-NS and Fis (5). The number of DNA-binding sites by the nucleoid proteins with regulatory roles such as Fis and IHF ranges several hundreds as detected by Genomic SELEX screening (Kori,A. and Ishihama,A., unpublished data). For the confirmation of Dan binding to the DNA sequences identified by the Genomic SELEX screening, we performed the gel mobility shift assay for five representative DNA probes from SELEX-clos and SELEX-chip library: dan-ttdA (Figure 2A), maoC-paaA ( Figure 2B), yfaZ-yfaO ( Figure 2C) and intZ-yffL ( Figure 2D) from group A, and ygaD-[mltB]-srlA ( Figure 2E) and perR-[insN]-ykfC ( Figure 2F) from group B. In parallel, we analyzed several DNA probes from non-peak fractions of the SELEX-chip pattern, including ykgI-ykgC ( Figure 2G) and yjbR-[uvrA]-ssb ( Figure 2H). The 179-bp-long dan-ttdA probe with highaffinity to Dan formed a ladder consisting of at least eight bands on PAGE (Figure 2A), indicating that more than eight Dan molecules are able to bind to this 179-bp-long DNA segment (one Dan molecule per 20-bp-long DNA on average) in a sequential manner. Similar pattern of Dan binding was observed in all other SELEX DNA fragments tested, including all four group-A probes, dan-ttdA (Figure 2A), maoC-paaA ( Figure 2B), yfaZ-yfaO ( Figure 2C), intZ-yffL ( Figure 2D) and two group-B probes, ygaD-[mltB]-srlA ( Figure 2E) and perR-[insN]-ykfC ( Figure 2F). However, gel retardation was not observed with probes with non-peak probes, yjbR-[uvrA]-ssb ( Figure 2G) and ykgI-ykgC ( Figure 2H), selected from the SELEX-chip pattern (Figure 1). The gel shift assay indicates that a certain level of the sequence selectivity of DNA binding by Dan. The gel mobility shift pattern of multi-step-complex formation is essentially the same with those of the major nucleoid proteins, HU and IHF (19), indicating that protein oligomerization takes place on DNA-bound Dan molecules (see below for AFM images).",

After brief treatment with DNase I, at least four protected regions were identified ( Figure 3A), of which three (Dan-I, Dan-II and Dan-III) covered 14-bp-long sequences and one (Dan-IV) covered 29-bp sequence, suggesting that two molecules of Dan are associated with Dan-IV site, designated as Dan-IV-1 and Dan-IV-2 ( Figure 3B). Besides the protection against DNase-I digestion, a hypersensitive site was also detected near the center within the protected regions as in the case of Dan-III region ( Figure 3A). All the protected regions by Dan against DNase-I digestion included GTTNATT consensus sequence ( Figure 3C). Similar GTTNATT-like sequences were identified in all other Dan-binding sites identified by both SELEXclos and SELEX-chip (data not shown). After search of GTTNATT consensus sequence in the entire E. coli genome using the coliBASE database program (http://xbase.bham.uk/), a total of 1869 Dan-binding sites on top strand and 1860 sites on bottom strand were predicted to exist in the E. coli MG1655 genome. Sequence logo analysis of all these sequences indicates a high-level conservation of this 6-bp consensus GTTNATT sequence ( Figure 3D).",

The native nucleoid conformation of E. coli was also investigated successfully with AFM (39,40). AFM analysis provides some distinct advantages over bulk biochemical assays, particularly when studying DNA-protein interactions. For analysis of structural characteristics of Dan-DNA interaction, we also employed AFM to directly visualize Dan-DNA complexes. The mode of Dan binding to DNA was studied using a circular pGRdan plasmid (10-bp dan-promoter assay vector) as a probe, which contains the dan-ttdA spacer region with Dan-binding activity in the promoter assay vector pGRP (26). By gel mobility shift assay, this sequence formed multiple bands of Dan-DNA complexes at moderate protein concentrations below the aggregation thresholds (Figure 2A). Dan-DNA complexes were observed with AFM in the presence of various concentrations of Dan (Figure 4A-C; also see Supplementary Figure 1). At low Dan concentrations below the Dan/DNA molar ratio of 1/40, Dan bound to various positions along the entire plasmid DNA ( Figure 4A). At high Dan concentrations >1/10, the Dan-DNA complexes were converted into rod-like  Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 1; for the model Figure 8).",

Since the length fluctuation increased upon increase in Dan concentration, the images were classified into three groups, group-I (<0.96 mm), group-II (between 0.96 and 2.08 mm) and group-III (2.08-3.20 mm), with respect to the contour length ( Figures 4E and 5).

Accordingly, the longest group-III complexes disappeared upon further increase in Dan concentration, and instead the proportion of intermediate-sized group-II increased linearly ( Figure 5).

We then measured the intracellular concentration of Dan under various culture conditions by using the quantitative western blot analysis (5,21). When E. coli cells were grown under aerobic conditions in either rich (LB) or poor (M9-0.4% glucose) medium, the level of Dan was <10% of the level of RNA polymerase a subunit ( Figure 6A). Under the same culture conditions, the level of a subunit is $5000 molecules per genome equivalent of DNA (3,41), while the major nucleoid proteins (HU, IHF and H-NS) in exponentially growing E. coli cells range from 5000 to 50 000 molecules per genome (5,20,41). Thus, Dan has never been identified as a structural component of the E. coli nucleoid because the intracellular level of Dan is <1% of the major nucleoid proteins.",

Under a hypoxic culture condition, the level of Dan was 1.5-to 2.0-fold higher than the RpoA level in both rich and poor media and from exponential growth to stationary phase ( Figure 6B). On the basis of RpoA level ($5000 molecules per genome equivalent DNA), the level of Dan was estimated to range 7000-9000 molecules per genome. In late stationary phase, the Dan level was significantly higher in the poor medium than in the rich medium ( Figure 5B, 96-144 h culture).

Consequently, we observed the intracellular distribution of Dan in E. coli grown under aerobic and hypoxic conditions. The intracellular level of Dan within the aerobically grown wild-type KP7600 cells is very low (Figure 6A), showing a faint staining with anti-Dan antibodies ( Figure 7A, W1-W4). This faint staining was not detected in the mutant JD24074 lacking the dan gene ( Figure 7A, M1-M4). Under the hypoxic conditions, Dan was markedly induced ( Figure 6B), and formed highly stained dots ( Figure 7B, W1-W4; Figure 6D, W), indicated that Dan belongs to the group-II nucleoid proteins, including Fis, Rob (CbpB), CbpA and IciA, which show irregular distribution within the nucleoid (28). The distribution pattern is mostly similar to that of Fis, a bifuctional nucleoid protein with the regulatory activity of a set of growth-related genes. In the highly induced wild-type E. coli cells under the hypoxic conditions, Dan is enriched near the interface between the nucleoid and cytoplasm (or the surface of nucleoid), suggesting that some of the over-produced Dan is enriched in the boundary between nucleoid and cytoplasm. In the dan mutant, no immuno-stained Dan dots were detected ( Figure 7B, M1-M4; Figure 6D, M), indicating that Dan could not be detected by the immunostaining method using the same anti-Dan antibody.",

This extension in the contour width may be due to local folding of DNA at the site of Dan binding as observed with AFM ( Figure 8B). The length of Dan-DNA form-I complexes is smaller than that of pGRdan plasmid ( Figure 5), supporting our proposal that Dan plays a role in local folding of DNA, ultimately leading to DNA compaction.

For instance, Fis is synthesized preferentially in growing cells (19,43) and plays an essential role for maintenance of the nucleoid competent for transcription of the growth-related genes (3,5,41). Fis is one of the key global regulators of a number of genes for adaptation to external conditions such as the availability of oxygen and nutrients (22,23). On the other hand, Dps (DNAbinding protein form starved cells) is the major nucleoid protein only in starved stationary-phase cells (6,20,24) and plays roles in protecting resting bacterial cells from environmental stresses such as high levels of toxic iron. During the transition of E. coli cells from exponential growth to stationary phase, marked changes take place on the cell shape and properties, allowing physical separation of cells at different stages (44). Growth-coupled transformation of the E. coli nucleoid from exponential growth phase-specific fibrous structures to stationary phase-specific rod forms (41) depends on the association of Dps to the genome DNA. This group of nucleoid proteins may be stored on the nucleoid surface, forming dots as detected by indirect immuno-staining (28; also Figure 7).",

Interestingly, tartrate dehydratase encoded by ttdA-ttdB for uptake of antioxidant tartrate is required for anaerobic growth on glycerol as a carbon source. Our findings extend this concept and further indicate that Dan is a bifunctional nucleoid protein, playing dual roles both in structuring the nucleoid under anaerobic growth conditions and in regulation of a set of genes needed for growth under anaerobic conditions. Along this line, besides the ttdA-ttdB-ygiE operon, a set of genes must exist, which are induced in the presence of Dan altogether contribute to the E. coli survival under the anaerobic conditions such as within animals.",

(A) On the bases of AFM image analysis of Dan-pGRdan DNA complexes formed at increasing concentrations of Dan (see Figure 1), we propose a model of the conformational change of plasmid DNA. At low Dan concentrations, Dan binds various positions on pGRdan in non-specific manner (Form I). Each Dan may play a role of seeding for further assembly of additional Dan molecules. At high Dan concentration, the increased number of Dan molecules bound to DNA strand, leading to extension of Dan oligomers along the DNA strand and ultimately covering the entire DNA surface (Form 2). Typical AFM images of form-I and form-II Dan-DNA complexes are shown on left (500 \u00c2 500 nm 2 area; scale bars, 100 nm).
