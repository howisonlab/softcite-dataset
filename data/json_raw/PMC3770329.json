            "text": "Apoptosis is a fundamental homeostatic mechanism essential for the normal growth, development and maintenance of every tissue and organ. Dying cells have been defined as apoptotic by distinguishing features, including cell contraction, nuclear fragmentation, blebbing, apoptotic body formation and maintenance of intact cellular membranes to prevent massive protein release and consequent inflammation. We now show that during early apoptosis limited membrane permeabilization occurs in blebs and apoptotic bodies, which allows release of proteins that may affect the proximal microenvironment before the catastrophic loss of membrane integrity during secondary necrosis. Blebbing, apoptotic body formation and protein release during early apoptosis are dependent on ROCK and myosin ATPase activity to drive actomyosin contraction. We identified 231 proteins released from actomyosin contraction-dependent blebs and apoptotic bodies by adapted SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) combined with mass spectrometry analysis. The most enriched proteins released were the nucleosomal histones, which have previously been identified as damage-associated molecular pattern proteins (DAMPs) that can initiate sterile inflammatory responses. These results indicate that limited membrane permeabilization occurs in blebs and apoptotic bodies before secondary necrosis, leading to acute and localized release of immunomodulatory proteins during the early phase of active apoptotic membrane blebbing. Therefore, the shift from apoptosis to secondary necrosis is more graded than a simple binary switch, with the membrane permeabilization of apoptotic bodies and consequent limited release of DAMPs contributing to the transition between these states. Apoptosis allows for efficient and immunologically silent removal of damaged or superfluous cells in multicellular organisms. 1 Despite 410 9 apoptotic events occurring per day in human adult tissues, it is surprisingly difficult to histologically detect apoptotic cells due to the rapid recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells. 2,3 A key feature of apoptosis has been defined as the maintenance of an intact cellular membrane (detectable as exclusion of impermeable dyes such as propidium iodide, PI) throughout the apoptotic program to prevent intracellular protein release and subsequent immunological activation. 1,[3][4][5][6] If the apoptotic cell is not recognized and cleared, this may be succeeded by secondary necrosis, during which cells lose membrane integrity, lyse and release intracellular contents including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that alert and activate innate immune cells leading to rapid sterile inflammatory responses, which aid in the resolution of the initiating cell/tissue damage. [7][8][9] DAMPs are cellular constituents that are normally only exposed to innate immune cells when released from dying/dead cells. Cell surface sensors on immune cells that ordinarily recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns produced by infectious agents may also interact with DAMPs, leading to the activation of signaling pathways resulting in a nonpathogen-induced 'sterile' inflammatory response. Immune cell responses induced by DAMPs may include cytokine and chemokine release to activate inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. 7 The goal of these processes is detection and removal of dead cells and associated debris to limit potential further damage.",

[10][11][12] The driving force behind apoptotic actomyosin contractility is caspase-mediated cleavage and consequent constitutive activation of ROCK1. 11,12 Blebs are formed when the plasma membrane delaminates from the cortical cytoskeletal network to form blisters that are expanded by increased hydrostatic pressure produced by actomyosin-mediated cellular contraction. 13,14 As apoptosis progresses, blebs may break away from the cell body to form membrane-clad apoptotic bodies. A common assumption is that apoptotic bodies have a passive role in apoptotic cell clearance simply because they are smaller and therefore more readily phagocytosed than the intact cell body. 15,16 Moreover, inhibition of ROCK activity significantly reduces apoptotic body formation and apoptotic cell phagocytosis. 15,16 Therefore, an additional possibility is that apoptotic bodies have active roles in promoting apoptotic cell clearance.",

However, we now show that unlike the membranes of the apoptotic cell body, a significant proportion of apoptotic body membranes do not form impermeable barriers, allowing for the limited macromolecule ingress and egress. Inhibition of actomyosin contraction through ROCK or myosin ATPase blockade reduces apoptotic body numbers formed during early apoptosis and concomitantly represses protein release without affecting the apoptotic program. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) identified nucleosomal histones, which are validated DAMPs, as the most highly enriched proteins released in an actomyosin-dependent manner before secondary necrosis. Stable isotope-labeled histones released from apoptotic cells were identified as being phagocytosed by macrophages. These results show that the progression from apoptosis to secondary necrosis does not occur as a two-state switch. Instead, as they are generated, the permeable membranes of apoptotic bodies allow the release of limited amounts of DAMPs that would locally engage with components of the innate immune system, thereby providing a mechanism that would contribute to a phased transition between apoptosis and full-blown secondary necrosis.",

Time-lapse microscopy revealed that shortly after blebbing onset (B4 h after TNFa/CHX treatment), newly formed blebs and apoptotic bodies (small membrane-encapsulated subcellular particles that dissociate from blebbing cells) appear that do not exclude PI (Figure 1b, from 4 : 14 : 30, examples indicated by white, blue, yellow or red arrows).

            "text": "To characterize apoptotic body membrane permeability, we assessed PI staining of the apoptotic bodies released from NIH3T3 cells 4 h after TNFa/CHX treatment. Analysis of small subcellular debris (low forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), Figure 2a first panel) revealed that a large subpopulation of the 100 000 counted apoptotic bodies were PI positive (defined by gatings that count r1% of autofluorescent apoptotic bodies in the absence of PI, Figure 2a second panel), indicating that these apoptotic bodies not only contained nucleic acids but also allowed entry of 668 Da PI molecules (Figure 2a middle panel). Treatment of apoptotic bodies with RNAseA alone, or in combination with DNAse1, reduced PI staining (Figure 2a fourth and fifth panels), indicating that molecules as large as RNAseA and DNAse1 (13 and 31 kDa, respectively) accessed the interior of apoptotic bodies and degraded nucleic acid cargo, thus reducing PI fluorescence. The reduction in PI staining by RNAse \u00fe DNAse1 was significant (Po0.01) following the induction of apoptosis 4 h after treatment withTNFa/CHX, anti-CD95 (Fas receptor) antibody/CHX or ultraviolet light (UV) in NIH3T3 established mouse fibroblasts (Figure 2b), primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs; Figure 2c), MCF10a human mammary epithelial cells ( Figure 2d) and primary mouse keratinocytes (Figure 2e). These results indicate that whether the apoptotic stimulus was extrinsic or instrinsic, or whether the cells were primary or established, or epithelial or mesenchymal, a significant proportion of apoptotic bodies have membranes permissive for macromolecule passage. The permeability of apoptotic body membranes to macromolecules was additionally validated using NIH3T3 cellsexpressing membrane-tagged green fluorescent protein (mGFP; Figure 2f left panel). 18 Following the induction of apoptosis for 4 h, B33% of resulting apoptotic bodies had mGFP fluorescence greater than the autofluorescence of apoptotic bodies from unlabeled cells (Figure 2f right panel). Treatment with Proteinase K (MW \u00bc 28 kDa) significantly (Po0.01) reduced the proportion of GFP-positive apoptotic bodies by 70%, indicating that most apoptotic bodies did not exclude Proteinase K (Figure 2g). When GFP-positive apoptotic bodies were incubated with PI in the absence or presence of RNAse \u00fe DNAse1, PI staining of the 11% double GFP/PI-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (Po0.01) reduced by over 50% through the actions of RNAse \u00fe DNAse1 (Figures 2h and i). These observations indicate that many apoptotic bodies failed to exclude molecules as large as 31 kDa, suggesting that their membranes also would allow comparably sized molecules to escape.",

            "text": "Actomyosin contractility drives apoptotic body formation and lactate dehydrogenase release. We previously showed that apoptotic membrane blebbing results from caspase-mediated cleavage and consequent activation of ROCK1 to drive actomyosin contraction. 6,11 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that the typical pattern of membrane blebbing induced by TNFa/CHX could be blocked by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 19 or the myosin ATPase inhibitor Blebbistatin 20  (Figure 3a). By collecting equal volumes of media from 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes of NIH3T3 cells that were untreated or treated for 4 h with TNFa/CHX, and then adding equivalent numbers of FITC-labeled polystyrene microbeads as a counting reference ( Figure 3b, left and middle panels), FACS analysis revealed that the small number of low FSC/SSC particles was greatly and significantly (Po0.01) increased by TNFa/ CHX ( Figure 3b 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 PI absence or presence of Y27632 or Blebbistatin revealed that actomyosin contraction inhibition significantly (Po0.01) reduced apoptotic body formation following apoptosis induction by each stimulus (Figure 3c). In contrast, caspase activity induced by TNFa/CHX, anti-CD95/CHX or UV was insensitive to Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 3d), indicating that actomyosin contraction was required for apoptotic body formation, but not for apoptosis induction by these stimuli. Similarly, cleavage of the caspase substrate ROCK1 in TNFa/CHX-treated cells was not affected by Y27632 (Figure 3d inset). Consistent with previous findings 16 and with the ROCK inhibitory action of Y27632, ROCK1 knockdown ( Figure 3e, inset panels) impaired actomyosin contractile force generation leading to significantly (Po0.01) reduced apoptotic body formation ( Figure 3e) and plasma membrane blebbing in a large proportion of cells ( Figure 3f), without affecting caspase activation as determined by PARP1 cleavage (Figure 3e, inset panels). We next measured lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, monomer MW \u00bc 35 kDa, tetramer MW \u00bc 140 kDa) activity in conditioned media, the release of which is often used to measure loss of membrane integrity. 21 LDH release was assayed in media from each of the four indicated conditions at 4 and 24 h, relative to the amount of LDH released from cells induced to undergo necrotic death by three freeze/thaw cycles. Paralleling the effects on apoptotic body formation (Figure 3c), the increase in LDH activity present in apoptotic cell conditioned media (AC-CM) at 4 h compared with untreated cells was significantly (Po0.001) reduced when actomyosin contractility was blocked with Y27632 or Blebbistatin treatment (Figure 4a). However, there was no effect of either inhibitor on LDH release 24 h after apoptosis induction, consistent with protein release at this late time point resulting from loss of membrane integrity and lysis during secondary necrosis, which was unaffected by the inhibition of actomyosin contractility. In addition, release of the chromatin-associated nuclear high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1, MW \u00bc 25 kDa) into tissue culture media, which had GFP added as a processing/loading control, was undetectable at 12 h after apoptosis induction but prominent in each condition at 24 h (Figure 4b), consistent with it being a later-released necrosis marker. 22 SEM revealed that TNFa/CHX-treated cell morphology could not be distinguished from TNFa/CHX \u00fe Y27632 or TNFa/CHX \u00fe Blebbistatin-treated cells after 24 h (Figure 4c). Although cells undergoing secondary necrosis released proteins such as LDH ( Figure 4a) and HMGB1 ( Figure 4b), their FSC/SSC profiles revealed that they largely remain intact with cells sizes smaller than healthy viable cells ( Figure 4d). The ability of actomyosin contraction inhibitors Y27632 and Blebbistatin to suppress LDH release during early apoptosis ( Figure 4a) was directly associated with the significant reduction in apoptotic bodies produced during early apoptosis (Figure 3c), which would then allow limited protein release before complete loss of membrane integrity during secondary necrosis.",

            "text": "To accomplish this, proteins were concentrated from conditioned media using StrataClean resin and separated on polyacrylamide gels. Similar to LDH release (Figure 4a), there was a clear increase in bulk protein release 4 h after treatment with apoptotic inducer, which was reduced by Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 5a). We then performed quantitative proteomic analysis using an adapted approach combining stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and MS. 23 Individual NIH3T3 fibroblasts populations were grown in defined SILAC medium containing light (no isotope label), medium (Lys4, Arg6) or heavy (Lys8, Arg10) amino acids ( Supplementary Figure 1). Each labeled cells population was assigned an experimental treatment: reference (untreated); apoptosis (TNFa/CHX); apoptosis with reduced apoptotic body formation (TNFa/CHX \u00fe Y27632 or Blebbistatin) and six replicate experiments performed with each set of conditions cycled through the SILAC labels ( Supplementary Figure 1). After 4 h, AC-CM was collected and pooled from each of the three conditions, followed by concentration and electrophoresis before tryptic digestion and analysis of protein tryptic fragments by MS. A hit-list was compiled of proteins that were significantly different (using a randomized permutation test, Po0.05) between treatment groups, which were enriched for release from apoptotic cells relative to control cells, and which were reduced by both Y27632 and Blebbistatin to inhibit actomyosin contraction (Supplementary Table 1, the top 20 released proteins are in Table 1). Using these criteria, 231 proteins were released from apoptotic bodies in an actomyosin-dependent manner, while the release of five extracellular matrix proteins were actually reduced (Fibronectin1, Sparc, Timp2, Thrombos-pondin2 and Decorin), which could be at least partially restored by Y27632 and Blebbistatin (Figure 5b). Consistent with LDH as a protein validated for actomyosin-dependent release from apoptotic bodies (Figure 4a), it also was identified in the MS analysis (Supplementary Table 1). When fold enrichment in protein release was compared with protein mass, it was apparent that most proteins were r100 kDa, while the most abundantly released proteins were among the smallest (Figure 5c). Gene ontology analysis revealed that most proteins were either enzymes or structural/adapter proteins (Figure 5d). After collecting apoptotic bodies by sorting, gel electrophoresis revealed Coomassie-stained proteins with a range of molecular weights (Figure 5e, left panel), whereas western blotting showed Lamin A and Gelsolin in apoptotic bodies (Figure 5e, middle and left panels). These results indicate that even if proteins may be released, apoptotic bodies retain at least a proportion of their contents, including the proteins identified as being significantly released (Table 1). Relative to their proportions in the proteome, enzymes (P \u00bc 3.18 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 10 ) and structural/adapter proteins (P \u00bc 0.032) were over-represented among released proteins, whereas transcription factors (P \u00bc 0.018) and receptors (P \u00bc 5.55 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 5 ) were underrepresented. The presence of a number of enzymes associated with glycolysis likely reflects their relatively high abundance, solubility and cytoplasmic localization, 24 resulting in their tendency to be released from permeabilized apoptotic bodies. The majority of the actin-associated proteins were also previously found to be more abundant in protrusive lamellipodia than cell bodies. 25 Given that following initial bleb protrusion, there is recruitment of actomyosin cytoskeletal components to facilitate bleb retraction, 26 it is logical that there would be common enriched proteins in protrusive lamellipodia and blebs/apoptotic bodies, which in the latter case may be released from permeabilized membranes during early apoptosis.",

Gelsolin regulates actin filament dynamics, and a secreted form has important extracellular roles in the regulation of inflammation. 27,28 To validate the SILAC/MS results and determine whether Gelsolin release was dependent upon actomyosin contraction and consequent apoptotic body formation (Figure 3c), we blotted AC-CM from cells that were untreated or treated with TNFa/CHX for 4 h in the absence or presence of ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or myosin ATPase inhibitor Blebbistatin. Both Y27632 and Blebbistatin significantly (Po0.01) reduced Gelsolin release relative to control apoptotic cells (Figure 5f), despite these treatments having no effect on caspase activation (Figure 3d). These results confirm that Gelsolin release during early apoptosis is largely dependent upon actomyosin contraction, which drives blebbing and apoptotic body formation.",

            "text": "Actomyosin contractility promotes histone translocation to membrane blebs and apoptotic bodies. The most highly enriched proteins released were nucleosomal histones (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1), which have been characterized as potent DAMPs that activate cells of the innate immune system by binding to Toll-like receptors 2, 4 and 9 (TLR) either directly or complexed with DNA. [29][30][31] In addition, histones are significant autoantigens in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. 32  DAMPs were identified in this screen (Supplementary Table 1), including S100 and heat shock family proteins. Transmission electron microscopy of apoptotic NIH3T3 cells revealed that portions of nuclei could be observed within membrane blebs (Figure 6a, indicated with arrow). GFPlabeled histone H3 (GFP-H3) was translocated from the nucleus to blebs in a population of apoptotic NIH3T3 cells (Figure 6b). FACS sorting apoptotic bodies from untransfected control and GFP-H3-expressing cells and then gating for GFP fluorescence greater than the level of autofluorescence in untransfected cells (Figure 6c, first to third panels) along with FITC-labeled polystyrene microbeads revealed that the total number of GFP-H3-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (Po0.01) reduced by Y27632 or Blebbistatin ( Figure 6d). In addition to total number, the proportion of GFP-H3-positive apoptotic bodies was significantly (Po0.01) reduced by Y27632 or Blebbistatin (Figure 6e). These results indicate that not only is actomyosin contractility necessary for the generation of apoptotic bodies ( Figure 3c) within which nuclear fragments may be contained, but consistent with our previous observation that actomyosin contractility is necessary for the tearing apart of apoptotic nuclei, 33 actomyosin contraction contributes to the translocation of histones from nuclei into blebs and actomyosin-dependent apoptotic bodies from which they may be released into the extracellular environment.",

            "text": "Macrophages internalize molecules as part of the innate immune response, which may influence the inflammatory response and contribute to antigen presentation. 34 To identify proteins from AC-CM that were ingested by macrophages, stable isotope-labeled-AC-CM from NIH3T3 cells were collected and then incubated for 2 h with RAW-264.7 mouse macrophages that had been treated with Bafilomycin A1 to block endosome acidification and subsequent proteolysis. Cell lysates were prepared, and for each protein a minimum of two SILAC-labeled tryptic peptides were unambiguously identified on the basis of their mass difference from endogenous peptides. An example trace of the peptide LLLPGELAK from histone H2B identified from unlabeled endogenous protein and Lys 8 -labeled AC-CM that had been taken up by RAW-264.7 cells is shown in Figure 7a. All four nucleosomal histones were identified as being phagocytosed by RAW-264.7 cells from AC-CM (Table 2). In addition, Vimentin was also identified as being taken up by RAW-264.7 cells (Table 2). Interestingly, citrullinated Vimentin (in which a terminal nitrogen on the side chain of arginines is replaced by oxygen) is a major autoantigen associated with rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. 35 Treatment of RAW-264.7 with varying amounts of purified recombinant histone proteins resulted in significant release of TNFa induced by H2A, H2B and H3, but not H4 (Figure 7b). Consistent with this response of being the result of TLR activation of the NF-kB pathway, 36 H2A treatment dramatically increased NFKBIA (IkBa) phosphorylation (Figure 7c). These results show that proteins released from actomyosin-dependent blebs and apoptotic bodies engage with macrophages, revealing a mechanism of communication between early apoptotic cells and components of the innate immune system.",

            "text": "As cell body membranes remain intact during early apoptosis, limited release of intracellular proteins has not been considered as a mechanism apoptotic cells might use to communicate their demise to the surrounding environment. In fact, protein release has generally been regarded to occur only during secondary necrosis when cell body membrane integrity is lost. 1,4 Our data demonstrate that acute protein release from apoptotic cells is a bona fide apoptotic process and is influenced by actomyosin contractility that drives blebbing, apoptotic body formation and nuclear breakdown. 6,11,33 Apoptotic body permeabilization in early apoptosis provides a simple route for intracellular proteins to participate in complex extracellular signaling events. Further, these observations highlight a novel biological function for actomyosin-induced blebbing, which is to generate independent subcellular apoptotic bodies that could travel away from the apoptotic cell and release protein quanta that alert surrounding cells before secondary necrotic membrane breakdown. 37,38 Protein release from apoptotic bodies would potentially increase the distance from which innate immune cells could detect apoptotic cells. Apoptotic bodies dispatching 'suicide notes' may be an important mechanism to trigger safe and rapid clearance (Figure 7d). In addition, some of these proteins released, such as histones, are taken up by macrophages, where they may influence information processing to influence the type, intensity and/or duration of cellular responses, or may be processed for antigen presentation. Histones and Vimentin, which were identified as phagocytosed by macrophages, are significant autoantigens in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively, suggesting that apoptotic bodies could be a source of immunogens. 39,40 These results also reveal that the transition from apoptosis to secondary necrosis is not an off/on switch. Apoptotic bodies generated during early apoptosis release limited amounts of intracellular proteins in advance of secondary necrosis thereby providing a means for the phased transition between these two states. Our systematic quantitative SILAC survey of AC-CM identified numerous proteins released during early apoptosis that were sensitive to inhibition of actomyosin contraction. The most highly enriched proteins were the nucleosomal histones, which have previously been validated as DAMPs that reportedly act via TLR2, TLR4 and/or TLR9. [29][30][31]41 Histone engagement of TLRs results in the production and release of cytokines and chemokines that alert the innate immune system to the presence of damage. Other putative DAMPs were identified from the S100 and HSP protein families (Supplementary Table 1). However, the validation of these proteins as genuine DAMPs is controversial because of the possibility that bound enterotoxins accounted for the proinflammatory activities of purified forms of these proteins. 7  Some proteins released may interact with and be ingested by macrophages to help activate non-infectious inflammatory responses before the complete loss of membrane integrity that may occur during secondary necrosis Table 2 Released SILAC-labeled proteins from which peptides were identified within RAW-264.7 cells",

Each labeled population was used in each treatment condition, with Blebbistatin substituting for Y27632 in one set of experiments, for a total of six replicates.
