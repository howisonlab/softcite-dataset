            "text": "Eye blinks, typically occurring 15-20 times per minute, rarely capture attention during face-to-face interaction. To determine the extent to which eye blinks affect the viewer's brain activity, we recorded magnetoencephalographic brain responses to natural blinks, and to the same blinks slowed down to 38% of the original speed. The stimuli were presented on video once every 2.3-6.2 s. As a control, we presented two horizontal black bars moving with the same time courses and the same extent as the eyelids in the blink video. Both types of blinks and bars elicited clear responses peaking at about 200 ms in the occipital areas, with no systematic differences between hemispheres. For the bars, these main responses were (as expected) weaker (by 24%) and later (by 33 ms) to slowmotion than normal-speed stimuli. For blinks, however, the responses to both normal-speed and slow-motion stimuli were of the same amplitude and latency. Our results demonstrate that the brain not only responds to other persons' eye blinks, but that the responses are as fast and of equal size even when the blinks are considerably slowed down. We interpret this finding to reflect the increased social salience of the slowed-down blinks that counteracted the general tendency of the brain to react more weakly and more slowly to slowly-vs. quickly-changing stimuli. This finding may relate to the social importance of facial gestures, including eye blinks.",

Similarly, blinks cluster around pauses in speech seen on video, but only when the voice can be heard (Nakano & Kitazawa, 2010). Such inter-subject synchronization of eye blinks suggests that blinks play a role beyond corneal moistening, likely related to human social interaction. Eye blinks also affect the judgments that people make about others: those who blink very often are perceived as nervous or careless (Omori & Miyata, 2001).",

In a recent scalp electroencephalography (EEG) study, a sequence of three images simulating eye blinks elicited several successive evoked potential deflections peaking at 100-600 ms (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2011). To investigate how the human brain reacts to natural blinks, we recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain responses to eye blinks presented via video. We also presented the same blinks in slow motion. The aim was two-fold: first, to determine whether these slow stimuli would evoke any brain responses; and, if so, to examine whether these responses would be weaker and more prolonged compared with responses to normalspeed stimuli, as would be expected on the basis of the general tendency of the brain to react weaker and later to stimuli changing at slower speed (for a review, see Heinrich, 2007). As control stimuli, we presented two horizontal black bars that had similar size, location and movement characteristics as the eyelids during the blinks.",

Thus, the resulting signals were always positive.

The responses did not differ between these areas in any of the measured parameters (onset time, rising slope, peak latency, peak amplitude), and we therefore carried out further analyses on signals averaged across these three areas. Figure 3 depicts the signals averaged over the three areas for blinks and bars. Responses to normal-speed eye blinks started at 151 AE 15 ms (mean AE SEM) and peaked at 196 AE 16 ms. The corresponding values for slow-motion blinks were 157 AE 17 and 210 AE 14 ms. Thus, the responses to normal and slow-motion blinks did not differ either in onset or peak latencies, nor did their rising slopes differ. The normalized peak amplitudes were 44.8 AE 7.1% (out of individual response maxima) for normal-speed blinks and 49.2 AE 7.2% for slow-motion blinks; the maximum signals (over all stimulus types) were obtained later than the first peak (on average, at 359 AE 39 ms).",

Interestingly, neither the strengths nor the onsets or peak latencies differed between the blinks shown at normal speed vs. slow motion, with the speed decreased to 38% of the original. In contrast, responses to bars used as control stimuli were weaker and delayed when the stimulus speed was slowed down. This latter effect agrees with earlier findings that brain responses decrease when light-spot stimuli move at slower speed (Kawakami et al., 2002). Accordingly, transient cortical responses to simple auditory stimuli peak later to stimuli with slower rise times (for a review, see Hari, 1990). Cortical responses to blinks thus behaved clearly differently than expected on the basis of simple physical characteristics, as the strengths and peak latencies did not differ between considerably slowed-down and normal-speed eye blinks.",

Moreover, socially relevant stimuli, such as emotional vs. neutral faces, elicit stronger EEG responses in posterior temporal brain regions even when the perceivers concentrate on, for example, gender and not emotion (Sato et al., 2001).

These 'blinks' elicited robust occipito-temporal P100 and right-hemisphere-lateralized N170 responses, which did not differ from responses to gaze movements and eye closures also presented within the same stimulus sequence.

Social context or meaning of the observed facial gestures modifies the viewer's brain responses. For example, the 150-160-ms MEG responses arising from the MT/V5 region were stronger to gaze-change stimuli, composed of two images generating a percept of apparent movement, when the gaze shifted towards rather than away from the viewer (Watanabe et al., 2006). On the other hand, the 170-ms temporal-lobe EEG response (N170) was weaker to direct than averted gaze (Puce et al., 2000). In a more complex social setting, where the subjects were viewing images of three faces, N170 was unaffected, but the later EEG responses (P350 and P500) were modified by the scenario involving social attention (Carrick et al., 2007).",

            "text": "In our study, both the socially relevant eye blinks and the moving bars used as control stimuli (but often interpreted as eyelid movements), elicited similar temporo-occipital responses peaking about 200 ms after the movement onset. A clear difference, however, was seen in the reactivity to stimulus speed: only responses to blinks, and not to bars, differed between the normal-speed and sloweddown stimuli.",

            "text": "Our blink and control (bar) stimuli differed in many visual features. Still, 10 out of 11 subjects reported that the bars reminded them of human eye blinks, probably reflecting the predisposition to perceive faces in various visual patterns. Good examples are the famous paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1526-1593) persuading viewers to perceive faces in paintings containing only vegetables, fruits, fish, miniature humans or inanimate objects. Accordingly, it is very difficult to create control stimuli for human blinks that would be similar to the original stimuli in low-level physical features but would not elicit an impression of blinking or a human face.",

            "text": "Although we saw that the responses to eye blinks started and peaked earlier compared with similarly moving bars, this effect could be due to differences in physical stimulus features. Therefore, drawing any conclusions from those direct comparisons between responses to blinks vs. bars would not be well-founded. Nevertheless, the differences between blink and bar stimuli cannot explain the differences between responses to normal and slow-motion stimuli of the same type.",

            "text": "Taken together, our results show that normal eye blinks are clearly registered in the viewer's brain, and that the responses remain equally fast and strong even when the speed of the blinks is considerably slowed down. This behavior contrasts responses to other similarly moving stimuli as they become weaker and delayed when the speed of the stimulus decreases. These findings support the view that eye blinks of other persons are socially relevant behavioral events and they should be adequately considered when studying social interaction.",
