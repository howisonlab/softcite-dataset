            "text": "Centrioles are conserved microtubule (MT)-based organelles that are essential for the formation of centrosomes, cilia, and flagella. Centriole duplication is a tightly ordered event that involves the growth of a procentriole orthogonal to a preexisting centriole (Azimzadeh and Marshall, 2010;Nigg and Stearns, 2011). A core of only a few evolutionarily conserved proteins, including SAS-6, CPAP/SAS-4, and STIL/Ana2/SAS-5, is indispensable for centriole assembly in worms, flies, and humans (Brito et al., 2012;G\u00f6nczy, 2012). The onset of centriole assembly in human cells is triggered by the activation of PLK4 (Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007) and the recruitment of CEP152 (Cizmecioglu et al., 2010;Dzhindzhev et al., 2010;Hatch et al., 2010) to the surface of the mother centriole. STIL (Tang et al., 2011;Arquint et al., 2012;Vulprecht et al., 2012) and hSAS-6 (Strnad et al., 2007) are then recruited to the base of the nascent procentriole during the late G1 and early S phases. CEP135 directly binds to hSAS-6 and CPAP, linking the cartwheel to the outer MTs (Lin et al., 2013). CPAP then promotes the assembly of nine triplet MTs during centriole biogenesis (Kohlmaier et al., 2009;Schmidt et al., 2009;Tang et al., 2009). CEP120 contains a C-terminal coiled-coil domain that is conserved in many organisms (Mahjoub et al., 2010). The putative orthologue of CEP120 (Uni2) in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is essential for basal body maturation and flagellogenesis (Piasecki et al., 2008). In mice, Cep120 is preferentially expressed in neural progenitors and is involved in controlling interkinetic nuclear migration (Xie et al., 2007). A recent study showed that Cep120 is up-regulated during the differentiation of mouse tracheal epithelial cells and is essential for centriole assembly (Mahjoub et al., 2010). However, the involved mechanisms are not yet clearly understood.",

            "text": "We initially identified CPAP as being associated with the \ue067-tubulin complex (Hung et al., 2000). More recent studies have demonstrated that CPAP is a positive regulator of centriole length (Kohlmaier et al., 2009;Schmidt et al., 2009;Tang et al., 2009) and that mutations in CPAP/CENPJ cause primary microcephaly in humans (Bond et al., 2005). Here, we show that CEP120 cooperates with CPAP to regulate centriole elongation. C entriole duplication begins with the formation of a single procentriole next to a preexisting centriole. CPAP (centrosomal protein 4.1-associated protein) was previously reported to participate in centriole elongation. Here, we show that CEP120 is a cell cycle-regulated protein that directly interacts with CPAP and is required for centriole duplication. CEP120 levels increased gradually from early S to G2/M and decreased significantly after mitosis. Forced overexpression of either CEP120 or CPAP not only induced the assembly of overly long centrioles but also produced atypical supernumerary centrioles that grew from these long centrioles. Depletion of CEP120 inhibited CPAP-induced centriole elongation and vice versa, implying that these proteins work together to regulate centriole elongation. Furthermore, CEP120 was found to contain an N-terminal microtubulebinding domain, a C-terminal dimerization domain, and a centriolar localization domain. Overexpression of a microtubule binding-defective CEP120-K76A mutant significantly suppressed the formation of elongated centrioles. Together, our results indicate that CEP120 is a CPAP-interacting protein that positively regulates centriole elongation.",

Thus, the branched filaments induced by CEP120 overexpression most likely represented abnormally splayed MTs extending from the elongated centrioles. Indeed, both the branched (Fig. 1,C [i and ii] and D [i], red arrowheads) and vertically aligned MT-based filaments (Fig. 1,C [iv and v] and D [ii], yellow arrowheads) could be clearly visualized by EM using different preparation methods (Fig. 1, C vs. D; and see Materials and methods).

Our results showed that these ectopic procentrioles appeared to be distributed along the elongated centrioles and often formed above the ODF2 appendage protein (Fig. 1 G). A few ectopic procentrioles (<3%) grew from the bases of ODF2-negative centrioles (Fig. 1 G). Together, we conclude that overexpression of CEP120 or CPAP produces atypical supernumerary centrioles and extra long MT-based filaments. This type of centriole amplification appears to differ from that observed in cells overexpressing PLK4 (Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007) or STIL (Tang et al., 2011), in which the amplified centrioles are observed around the base of the mother centriole.

Immunofluorescence analyses showed that N5-K76A, but not N5-E55A, was impaired in its ability to bind MTs (Fig. 5, C and D). Furthermore, the formation of extra long centrioles was significantly inhibited in cells expressing full-length K76A construct (Fig. 5, E and F). We thus conclude that the MT-binding activity of CEP120 is essential for its centriole-elongating activity. We also examined the dimerization activity of CEP120 and found that the E831P mutant greatly reduced the binding to itself (Fig. 5 B), but had only a mild inhibitory effect on centriole elongation (Fig. 5 F). Furthermore, the K76A mutant seemed to moderately inhibit normal centriole duplication (Fig. 5 H).",

A recent study showed that the nucleotide status of tubulin controls Sas-4 (a fly homologue of CPAP)-dependent recruitment of pericentriolar material (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2012). One possible scenario is that CPAP at the proximal end of a centriole may bind to either tubulin-GDP or tubulin-GTP via its intrinsic tubulin dimer binding domain. Such an interaction might then induce a conformational change that regulates the formation of CPAP-CEP120 Furthermore, MT cosedimentation experiments showed that GST-N5 could bind to and cosediment with MTs in the pellet (Fig. 4 E). These results suggest that the N terminus of CEP120 (N5, residues 1-209) directly binds to MTs.",

Consistent with this finding, we further narrowed down the centriolar localization to the C8 (residues 731-894) of human CEP120 (Fig. 4 C). Unexpectedly, the C-terminal C2 domain (Fig. 4 F) also possessed the ability to homodimerize. Our coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that the full-length CEP120-Myc and deletion constructs containing the C8 fragment (N3 and C2) were able to form complexes with full-length CEP120-GFP (Fig. 4 F), whereas the C8 fragment alone exhibited a very weak association (Fig. 4 F).

The Tet-inducible lines expressing CEP120-Myc or CPAP-Myc (Tang et al., 2009) were generated by transfection of U2OS-T-Rex cells that stably express the Tet repressor TetR. U2OS-T-Rex cells were produced by transfection with pcDNA6/TR encoding TetR. To produce a functional construct, the Myc tag must place at the C terminus of CEP120. The expressions of CEP120-Myc and CPAP-Myc were induced by the addition of 1 \u00b5g/ml Tet to the culture medium.",
