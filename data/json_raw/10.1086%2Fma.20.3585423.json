First, reflecting the influence of the Lucas (1976) critique, the emphasis on explicit microeconomic foundations is intended to ensure that the resulting structural equations are reasonably invariant to the choice of monetary policy. Second, this research follows the standard public finance approach of determining the policy regime that maximizes household welfare and then evaluating the performance of alternative policies relative to this benchmark.",

            "text": "After initially focusing on small stylized models, this line of research has subsequently proceeded to analyze micro-founded macroeconometric models that incorporate an expanded set of nominal and real rigidities and hence can be matched more closely to observed aggregate data. For example,  (henceforth CEE) specified a dynamic general equilibrium model with a number of distinct structural features: staggered wage and price setting with partial indexation, habit persistence in consumption, endogenous capital accumulation with higher-order adjustment costs, and variable capacity utilization. 2 Smets and Wouters (2003a) (henceforth SW) later applied full-information Bayesian methods to estimate essentially the same specification (augmented by a larger set of structural disturbances) and found that the model is competitive with an unrestricted Bayesian vector autoregression (VAR) in terms of goodness-of-fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance. 3 In this paper, we investigate the design of monetary policy when the central bank faces uncertainty regarding the true structure of the economy. Of course, a long-established literature has considered this topic using traditional structural macroeconomic models, building on the seminal work of Brainard (1967). 4 Nevertheless, recent analysis of small stylized micro-founded models has demonstrated that the implications of uncertainty can be markedly different when the policymaker's goal is to maximize household welfare because the welfare function itself depends on the specification and parameter values of the model. 5 By using a micro-founded macroeconometric modeling framework, we can examine the policy implications of several aspects of uncertainty that may be more difficult to consider in a small stylized model. First, by applying Bayesian methods, we can use the posterior distribution of the model parameters to determine whether simple rules that perform well in the baseline economy are robust to parameter uncertainty, that is, to the range of parameter values that are reasonably consistent with the observed data. Second, we can gauge the degree of innovation uncertainty by evaluating the extent to which the policy conclusions are sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the structural shocks to the model. Finally, we can explore the implications of specification uncertainty by changing specific features of the model such as the role of money balances or the structure of nominal contracts. 6 As the baseline specification for our analysis, we use a microfounded macroeconometric model similar to those studied by CEE and SW. Applying a Bayesian procedure to estimate this model with postwar U.S. data, we set the baseline values of the model parameters using the mean of the posterior distribution. We employ Lagrangian methods to determine the optimal policy under commitment in the baseline economy. Finally, we use second-order perturbation to solve the model and compute the level of welfare under the optimal policy as well as for alternative simple rules. 7 We find that a simple interest rate rule that responds solely to nominal wage inflation and the lagged interest rate yields a welfare out-come that nearly matches that under the fully optimal policy.8 Because this rule involves only observable variables and does not require a measure of the output gap, the natural rate of interest, or forecasts of variables, the rule can be implemented without assuming that the policymaker knows the correct specification of the model or the true values of the model parameters.",

Furthermore, under our baseline specification of Calvo-style contracts with an exogenous probability of reoptimization, many wage contracts remain in effect much longer than the one-year average duration. Thus, as emphasized by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), stabilizing aggregate wage inflation helps alleviate the degree of cross-sectional dispersion in real wages and thereby minimizes the associated inefficiencies in employment of differentiated labor services and in the allocation of leisure across households.",

Thus, research that reduces this type of uncertainty regarding certain key parameter values could be used to design monetary policy that yields a significant increase in welfare. The performance of the wage stabilization rule is also relatively insensitive to various assumptions regarding the nature and incidence of the innovations and to augmenting the model to incorporate monetary frictions.",

Of course, as Hall (2005) emphasizes, neither Calvo-style nor Taylor-style contracts provide the ideal microeconomic foundations for the determination of nominal wages and employment.

Whenever the contract is not reoptimized, the firm's price is adjusted automatically by the lagged rate of inflation raised to the power yp ~ [0,1]. This specification of price-setting behavior provides formal underpinnings for the hybrid New Keynesian Phillips curve.19 In particular, the indexation parameter yp determines the relative weight on the backward-looking versus forward-looking terms in the hybrid Phillips curve. While the magnitude of these weights is subject to ongoing controversy, recent analysis of aggregate data seems to be largely consistent with the available microeconomic evidence indicating that indexation is not a typical characteristic of price adjustment. 20 Under the assumption that all firms have the same marginal cost, the responsiveness of inflation to current marginal cost is determined solely by the parameter ?p. Typically, as in SW, the estimated value of ?p tends to imply a relatively long average duration of price contracts that is inconsistent with recent microeconomic evidence.21 Several recent studies have shown that incorporating additional real rigiditiessuch as quasi-kinked demand and firm-specific capital-yields more plausible estimates of the degree of nominal rigidity.22 Nevertheless, analyzing the second-order implications of these mechanisms poses some technical challenges that remain to be addressed in the literature.",

Thus, the size of the model is much larger under the optimal policy because these first-order conditions take the place of a single interest rate reaction function, while the set of Lagrange multipliers is added to the list of model variables.

In the RBC economy, real wages initially rise about 0.75 percent; with a constant price level, this adjustment occurs solely through a surge in nominal wage inflation. In contrast, the optimal policy for the baseline economy is mainly oriented towards minimizing cross-sectional dispersion in wage rates and hence permits a noticeable decline in prices while nominal wage inflation remains close to 0. Under the optimal policy (as in the RBC economy), the positive shock to productivity induces a substantial decline in aggregate labor hours that is gradually reversed over the subsequent year. Under the empirical reaction function, labor hours decline only for a single quarter and then rise above baseline. These findings relate to the debate regarding the empirical evidence of the response of hours to productivity shocks and the sensitivity of these results to monetary policy. We now compare the welfare implications of these policies for the baseline economy with stochastic variation in all of the exogenous disturbances except the monetary policy shocks. For each policy, table 4.2 reports the welfare cost of business cycles in terms of the equivalent percentage point change in steady-state consumption; this table also indicates welfare outcomes for two simple rules that are discussed further below.",

This type of rule is operational in the sense of McCallum (1999): the policy instrument is determined only by observable variables and not by model-specific constructed data such as the natural rates of interest and output, and forecasts of variables (which require knowledge of the economy).42 Furthermore, it is equivalent to targeting a deterministic path for the level of wages or prices; such policies have been shown to perform very well in the presence of the 0 lower bound on nominal interest rates.43 Given the role of wage dispersion in determining the welfare cost of business cycles, it is useful to consider policy rules that respond directly to nominal wage inflation, as suggested by Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000).44 Therefore, we consider a hybrid rule that responds differentially to both price and wage inflation, as well as rules that respond to price inflation alone. Optimizing the coefficients of the hybrid rule to maximize welfare in the baseline model, we find that r,, = 3.2 while r,, = 0. Thus, given that the optimized rule does not actually respond to price inflation, we simply refer to this rule as the benchmark wage inflation rule. We then compare its performance to an alternative rule that does not respond to wages-henceforth referred to as the benchmark price inflation rule-for which welfare optimization yields r, = 2.1.",

We compute the welfare losses associated with joint parameter uncertainty of the ten structural parameters together.45 For this purpose, we randomly select 5,000 draws of the parameter vector from the posterior distribution described above. For each draw, we compute welfare under the optimal policy for the true set of parameters and under the benchmark wage inflation policy. Note that this method incorporates the covariance between the model parameters, allowing for the possibility that particular combinations of parameter realizations may have sizeable effects on outcomes. Figure  4.5 reports the results from this exercise; the upper panel shows the resulting distributions of welfare losses under the two policies, and the lower panel shows the distribution of the relative welfare loss equal to the difference in welfare between the optimal policy and the benchmark wage inflation rule. Uncertainty about the structural parameters implies a great deal of uncertainty regarding the welfare loss associated with fluctuations, but far less uncertainty regarding the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy. As seen in the upper panel of the figure, the distribution of welfare losses under either policy is wide with a relatively long left tail. Under the optimal policy, the median welfare loss is 2.1 percent, just 0.1 percentage point larger than for the posterior mean estimates, but the 90 percent confidence interval for the welfare loss ranges from 4.3 percent to 0.9 percent. The results under the benchmark wage inflation rule are comparable. Thus, parameter uncertainty can easily make the welfare costs of fluctuations more than double what we estimate, or half as large, for that matter. However, as the lower panel of the figure shows, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule relative to the optimal policy is remarkably robust to parameter uncertainty. Indeed, the mean relative welfare loss, evaluated over the posterior distribution, is 0.14 percent, compared to 0.12 percent assuming no uncertainty, and the 90 percent probability interval for the relative welfare loss is fairly narrow, ranging from 0.06 to 0.35 percent.",

The relative performance of the benchmark wage inflation rule is sensitive to very high values of the Calvo wage parameter. For the other Calvo price and indexation parameters, the performance of the benchmark wage inflation policy drops off if prices are reoptimized very frequently or if a high share of contracts is indexed, neither of which is likely according to the posterior distribution. For example, consider the case that the true Calvo price parameter, cp, is as low as some of the micro evidence suggests. According to the posterior distribution, such a low value is extremely unlikely. But if true, knowledge of this parameter could be used to design a monetary policy that yields a moderate improvement in welfare. The same applies for the Calvo  wage and price indexation parameters. Although the degree of wage indexation is imprecisely estimated, the relative welfare loss is nearly invariant to the value of this parameter. Figure 4.7 plots the results for the parameters related to preferences and technology. Given the estimated precision of these parameter estimates, parameter uncertainty has trivial implications for welfare and therefore for policy.

In computing welfare, we have had to take a stand on each shock as to whether it reflects shifts in fundamentals, the effects of distortions, or measurement error. In particular, we have assumed that the wage and price shocks and the shocks to the external finance premium are distortionary, while the remaining shocks reflect shifts in fundamentals. We now revisit these assumptions and evaluate the performance of the various monetary policies under alternative assumptions regarding the nature of innovations. The baseline model is admittedly profligate in specifying shocks. In particular, the external finance premium has a large estimated variance and may be important for welfare according to the model but arguably lacks micro-foundations. It is important to note that we have assumed that this shock does not affect fundamentals but instead represents inefficient fluctuations in an external finance premium or a type of \"animal spirits\" that monetary policy should counteract. Therefore, we consider an alternative model specification in which these shocks do not exist; that is, Tobin's Q strictly follows fundamentals. We assume that these shocks represent measurement error evident in estimating the model but that they have no effects on the actual allocation of resources. We do not re-estimate the model, but rather we simply set the variance of the external finance premium shocks to 0.49 The second line of table 4.4 reports the results from this experiment. Eliminating the external finance premium shocks has little effect on welfare or on the relative performance of the various policy rules. We further examine how the policy rules perform under alternative assumptions regarding the nature of shocks to price and wage markups. In the baseline model, these shocks are viewed as being distortionary movements in markups. We now consider the possibility that these disturbances simply reflect measurement error that the econometrician faces in estimating the model. In implementing this idea, we do not reestimate the model, but instead simply zero out the markup innovations. We continue to assume that the policymaker is able to measure wage and price inflation accurately, that is, absent measurement error. (If the markup shocks in fact represented measurement error that the policymaker confronts, then the performance of the policy rules that we consider would deteriorate.) We consider each shock in isolation and the combined effect. The results are shown in the upper part of table 4.4.",

We suppose that nominal wages and prices are determined by staggered contracts that are reset every M periods. Thus, at t the distribution of wages is given by {Wt, j} where j = 1,... ,M denotes the number of periods since the last reset.

We do not change any other parameter estimates and revert to the baseline assumption that wages are indexed to past price inflation. The results are reported in table 4.5.

We reran it in combination with a standard hill-climber algorithm until it settled on the maximal value. We used the resulting mode as the starting point for our MCMC sampling. We then sample from the posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in order to make small sample inferences about the parameters. We sampled ten separate chains for 45,000 periods each, discarding the first 15,000   periods. Thus, we were left with 300,000 points from the posterior distribution. In order to assess convergence of the Markov chains, we use the potential scale reduction statistic described by Gelman, Carlin, Stem, and Rubin (2004), which gave clear indications of convergence for all the parameters.",

In response to positive shocks to wages and Tobin's Q, the optimal policy calls for a  sharp increase in interest rates that causes a large decline in consumption. The contractionary policy response reduces the responses of wages. In contrast, the estimated policy rule accommodates the shocks to a greater degree and allows larger rises in wage inflation. The optimal policy response to a transitory shock to prices, however, is to do almost nothing. The estimated policy rule reacts to the rise in inflation, sending real rates higher and reducing consumption and aggregate labor. See figures 4.9 through 4.12.",
