Since the sensitivity of culture and PCR for the diagnosis or exclusion of borreliosis is too low, a method is required that detects an active Borrelia infection as early as possible. For this purpose, a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) using lysate antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii and recombinant OspC was developed and validated through investigations of seronegative and seropositive healthy individuals as well as of seropositive patients with clinically manifested borreliosis. The sensitivity of the LTT in clinical borreliosis before antibiotic treatment was determined as 89,4% while the specificity was 98,7%. In 1480 patients with clinically suspected borreliosis, results from serology and LTT were comparable in 79.8% of cases. 18% were serologically positive and LTT-negative. These were mainly patients with borreliosis after antibiotic therapy. 2.2% showed a negative serology and a positive LTT result. Half of them had an early erythema migrans. Following antibiotic treatment, the LTT became negative or borderline in patients with early manifestations of borreliosis, whereas in patients with late symptoms, it showed a regression while still remaining positive. Therefore, we propose the follow-up monitoring of disseminated Borrelia infections as the main indication for the Borrelia-LTT.",

Lyme borreliosis first manifests locally on the skin at the site of the tick bite and then systemically, possibly affecting one or more organs such as the skin, joints, muscles, sense organs, nervous system and heart. In the latter case, early (stage I and II) and late (stage III) manifestations can be distinguished (1). Lyme borreliosis should be diagnosed by history and clinical symptoms. If the clinical symptoms are clear, laboratory diagnostics are of secondary importance only. The difficulty is, however, that the tick bite often goes unnoticed and the erythema migrans does not necessarily occur or is not noticed. In these cases, the requirement for early antibiotic treatment of borreliosis to prevent the complications of systemic dissemination of the pathogen, particularly of late borreliosis, cannot be met.",

In these cases, the detection of Borrelia-specific antibodies (serological laboratory diagnosis) becomes important for the diagnosis and treatment decision. The necessarily high quality demands cannot yet be completely fulfilled by Borrelia serology due to the following reasons: 1) Borrelia-specific IgM antibodies, and IgG antibodies in particular, cannot be detected until several weeks after infection [1,2].Seronegative cases with late stage Lyme borreliosis have also been recently described [3]. But these are becoming more rare with the increasing quality of the assays following the introduction of recombinant Borrelia antigens.",

Of central importance here are antigen-specific T helper lymphocytes (CD4 + T H cells). In addition to effector T cells, long-lived T and B memory lymphocytes are formed. In the presence of antigen-presenting cells and protein antigens, specific CD4 + T memory cells also proliferate in vitro. The lymphocyte transformation test (LTT), also known as the lymphocyte proliferation or lymphocyte activation test, is based on this principle [7]. Shortly after the discovery of B. burgdorferi, it was demonstrated that blood lymphocytes from Lyme borreliosis patients proliferate in the presence of Borrelia lysates [8,9]. Published data on the diagnostic value of the Borrelia-LTT, especially in seronegative patients, can be found beginning in 1988 [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. However, false positive LTT reactions have also been described [18][19][20]. Important for the motivation of our investigations presented here were observations that positive LTT reactions of blood lymphocytes to Borrelia antigens declined significantly or were negative after antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis [12,14,16,21]. This leads to the hypothesis that Borrelia-specific T helper cells circulate in the blood in detectable numbers only during an active immune response against Borrelia and persist in a non-florid infection in lymphoid organs.",

The incorporated 3 H-thymidine activity was measured as \"counts per minute\" (cpm) with a solid phase beta counter (Wallac). Mean value of the triplicates are used for analysis.

This improves the discriminatory power of positive and negative LTT results, even though the SI values of the positive reactions and the blank values are lower than in assays without interferon [23]. Another modification is the use of polymyxin B for the elimination of nonspecific activating lipid groups from the Borrelia lysates and traces of LPS from the rOspC expressed in E. coli.

In contrast, in preliminary tests with all recombinant Borrelia proteins (p93, p39, p34, p25, p18) available to us, only the rOspC (p25) was proven to be a suitable test antigen for the Borrelia-LTT. For all other proteins, the \"specific diagnostic width\" was too small (results of these preliminary tests are not shown). Nevertheless, the use of lysate antigens in LTT studies is, in principle, problematic, since each new antigen batch has to be tested in parallel with the previously used antigen batch. Therefore, the studies presented here were carried out with two different batches of antigen, which was especially important for the LTT results. The results achieved so far with lysate antigens, however, encourage us to test mixtures of recombinant antigens or Borrelia antigens purified from lysates in the LTT in the future in order to achieve well-defined reproducible test antigens.",

These results correspond to observations of other authors [12,14,16,21], but also contradict other reports [24,25,26]. The discrepancies are very likely due to the LTT method modified by us and the different antigens. According to our results, it is very likely that Borrelia-specific T helper cells, after overcoming the active infection (i.e., elimination of Borrelia antigens), migrate mainly from the bloodstream into the lymph nodes or spleen, and therefore their numbers in the blood are lower than the detection limit for the LTT. An allergen elimination test has the same effect in appropriate LTT applications in patients with type IV allergies to medications (non-published personal observation). Since the total number of T cells in the blood is relatively constant in individuals and even decreases with age, it is justified to assume that Borrelia-specific T cells circulate only during an active confrontation of the immune system with appropriate antigens in large numbers in the blood.",

However, the symptoms of disseminated borreliosis may persist after successful treatment for some time, however. An LTT follow-up examination is reasonable, at the earliest, 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of therapy. This interval is necessary because, on the one hand, possibly surviving Borrelia can become active during this time and, on the other hand, Borrelia-specific T cells persist in the blood for some time after elimination of the antigens. The Borrelia-LTT should not be performed during antibiotic therapy because, in our experience, the result will be negative, but soon after discontinuation of treatment, it may again become positive.",

This problem continues to exist unless there is sufficient testing of the antigen specificity of the Borrelia-LTT. In the case of frequently false positive reactions, the dose of the test antigens is too high. Currently, since there is no available gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of borreliosis or its exclusion, the Borrelia-LTT can only be validated according to clinical and serological findings. Nevertheless, there are still gaps in the validation that we conducted. For instance, it was only possible in individual cases to examine patients with active syphilis (n = 3) or leptospirosis infection (n = 2) for potential cross reactivity. In these few cases, there was no evidence of such cross-reactivity in the Borrelia-LTT. Allergies, autoimmune diseases and acute, persistent and latent viral infections (including HIV, EBV, CMV, VZV) have now been excluded, by further investigations, as a possible cause of false-positive reactions (unpublished data).",

            "text": "The in vitro antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation is the approved cellular immunological method for detecting antigen-specific memory T helper cells. In addition and prior to clonal lymphocyte proliferation, however, a series of immunologically relevant genes for both cell surface markers and especially cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon\u03b3 are activated, which in turn are used as the basis for newer cellular immunological laboratory methods. An example is the QuantiFERON test (interferon-\u03b3 stimulation) performed to detect a Mycobacter tuberculosis infection [32]. However, a distinction between a latent and florid infection is not possible with this test, however. Currently, the ELISPOT test (quantitative determination of cytokine-producing lymphocytes) is used in vaccine research in particular, and is also being tested in patients with a Borrelia infection. According to the previously published results by Forsberg et al. and our own experiences, even though seropositive individuals are detected by the ELISPOT assay, a differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic Borrelia infections was not possible [33][34][35]. The advantage of antigen-specific cytokine-stimulation assays would be that, while 6 days are required for an antigen-specific LTT test, the incubation period for the cytokine assay is only about 24 hours. It should be noted, however, that the biology on which these cellular immunological test systems are based is very different. While in the LTT setting T helper memory cells are clearly identified as cytokine producers, also other lymphocyte subpopulations like NK cells, and (depending on the cytokine) also monocytes are being taken into consideration as cytokine producers. However, cellular short-term stimulation methods are rather sensitive to nonspecific activations, while, in the LTT such influences dominate only during the first 48 to 72 hours, and thus have virtually disappeared after 6 days at the time the cellular proliferation is measured. For the particular issue of florid or non-active Borrelia infection, the situation is even more difficult since there is usually no gold standard available (i.e., patients with positive detection of live Borrelia). In this difficult situation, a new method should always be validated in comparison with an extensively proven method. The aim of our investigations were therefore to evaluate the results previously obtained with an optimized Borrelia-LTT in order to provide a basis for necessary comparative prospective studies with cellular immunological methods based on antigen-specific gene activation or cytokine stimulation. In our opinion, the Borrelia-LTT presented here fulfills the associated requirements.",
