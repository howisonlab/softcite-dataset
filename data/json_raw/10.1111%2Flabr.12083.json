            "text": "This paper analyses the relationship between wage distribution and educational attainment of the workforce. Wage inequality in Turkey decreased over 2002-10; a period over which it also saw an increase in the supply of educated workers. Our findings suggest that decreasing inequality in the bottom half of the distribution was largely due to decreasing returns to education and experience; whereas the moderate decline in inequality in the upper tail of the wage distribution is explained by a fall in returns to the 'routine' occupational tasks. The effect of changes in the composition of workers was found to be moderate. We are grateful to the Turkish National Statisitics Institute for making the data available. We would like to thank the participants at the 33rd IARIW General Conference, Rotterdam, Netherlands, August 2014, for their useful comments. We would also like to thank Sarah Brown, Ken Clark, Jonathan Perraton, Peter Wright, the editor, and an anonymous referee for their helpful comments.

            "text": "Following the dramatic increase in wage inequality observed across several countries, there has been a considerable interest in studying the distribution of wages, over the last three decades. In particular, the steep increase in the wage gap between the college and the high school graduates in the United States has been documented by many authors, starting with Katz and Murphy (1992) and Bound and Johnson (1992). Besides the United States, an increasing educational premium has also been documented for many OECD countries (Berman et al., 1997;Machin and Reenen, 1998). In line with these studies, most of the analysis in the literature has subsequently focused on wage inequality between workers with high and low educational qualifications. In these studies, the increasing wage inequality is mostly explained by the supply-demand approach and attributed to increasing skill demand. 1 Two most popular theories used to explain increase in the relative demand for skilled workers are the Stolper-Samuelson effects and the skill biased technological change (SBTC). The first theory argues that competition with labour-abundant countries decreases the relative price of labour-intensive goods and accordingly reduces the real wages of less educated workers in both relative and absolute terms (Hanson and Harrison, 1999). The SBTC theory argues that in accordance with the diffusion of higher technologies of information and communication, the labour demand has shifted in favour of skilled workers and increased the skill premiums (Acemoglu, 2002). Although there is no clear agreement, it is generally believed that SBTC is the main reason for increasing wage inequality. Most of the initial explanations for the increasing demand for skilled workers centred on the argument that the new and efficient technology that is embodied in the new capital equipment complimented the high skilled workers, thus depressing the relative demand for less skilled workers (Berman et al., 1994;Caselli, 1999;Galor and Tsiddon, 1997;Krusell et al., 2000).",

The argument here is that the changing nature of technology has resulted in the depression of returns to (and eventual loss of jobs in) 'routine' tasks that can now be performed by technologies. As these routine tasks are performed by the medium skilled workers, this in turn leads to wage polarization where, relative to middle of the wage distribution, the wages at the upper and the lower tail grow faster; this in turn then results in an increases in inequality in the top half of the distribution but a decrease in inequality in the bottom half of the distribution (Naticchioni et al., 2014).",

Using cross-sectional household data for Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Chinese Taipei and Uruguay, Robbins (1996) found that trade liberalization was accompanied by rise in relative wages and the demand for skilled workers. Hanson and Harrison (1999) examined the effects of Mexican trade reforms on wage inequality and they asserted that the rising wage gap was associated with changes internal to industries and could not be explained by the Stolper-Samuelson type effects. Galiani and Sanguinetti (2003) analysed the trade liberalization process which took place in Argentina during 1990s; their results show that trade openness explained only a small proportion of the increase in wage inequality. Berman and Machin (2000) analysed SBTC for developing countries and found evidence that demand for skilled labour increased in middle income countries and this increase was mainly due to skill upgrading within industries rather than a reallocation of employment from low-to high-skill industries.",

For our analysis we focus on the Turkish labour market, which experienced a substantial decrease in wage inequality between 2002 and 2010; a period over which it also saw a rapid increase in the educational attainment of the workforce. We explore the link between the changes in the relative supply of skilled labour, fall in the returns to education and decrease in wage inequality. Within this context we also check if there was any evidence of job polarization and its impact on wage inequality for Turkey;",

To do this we use the decomposition method proposed by Lemieux (2002); furthermore, in order to correct for the possible selection bias related to the participation in wage employment, a two-step procedure, proposed by Dubin and McFadden (1984), is also used within this decomposition. The analysis is done for both men and women separately.",

Wage inequality in Turkey decreased over this period with much of the decline happening in the lower tail of the wage distribution. Decomposition results reveal that decreasing wage inequality in the bottom half was mainly due to decreasing returns to education and experience. It is also found that the decrease in residual wage dispersion was mainly due to the decreasing price of unmeasured human capital. The moderate decline in inequality in the upper tail of the wage distribution is explained by fall in returns to 'routine' occupational tasks. Finally, the effect of changes in the composition of workers is found to be moderate.",

Elveren and Galbraith (2009) examined the sub-sectors of Turkish manufacturing and found an increase in the sector premiums between 1980 and 2001. Meschi et al. (2011) investigate the relationship between trade openness, technology adoption and relative demand for skilled workers in the Turkish manufacturing sector using firm-level data covering the period 1980-2001. They find evidence of skill upgrading within firms as a direct result of increased trade openness; thus lending support to the argument of SBTC in a middle income country like Turkey. Tansel and Bodur (2012) use the quantile regression technique to analyse the evolution of male wage inequality over the 1994-2002 period, using the Household Budget Survey (HBS). The authors find that there was an overall decline in wage inequality in Turkey; where inequality declined at the lower end of wage distribution while it increased at the top end. Their results indicated that education contributed to higher wage inequality through both within and between dimensions; and finally they find evidence of decreasing returns to education which they attribute to increase in the educational attainment of the labour forces, combined with a relatively stable demand for skilled workers.",

Hatakenaka (2006) argued that the new universities which are not located in metropolitan centres find it difficult to recruit qualified people because they are unwilling to relocate to outer regions even though several measures were tried in the past to address these issues. 5 In addition, due to the central university entrance examination system, more successful students have the chance of studying with other successful students in the universities with better resources and this leads to further skill differences between university graduates. 6 Considering these two developments, it can be argued that the supply of educated labour in labour force (employed and unemployed) continuously increased starting from the early 1990s. According to TurkStat web database, between 1988 and 2011 the share of individuals with university education in labour force increased from 4 to 21 per cent for women and 5-15 per cent for men. For the same period, the share of individuals with education less than high school in labour force decreased for both men and women. Similar patterns are also observed in the composition of the employed and the unemployed. Based on these observations, a decrease in educational premium can be expected; the increasing supply of workers with higher education is likely to decrease the upward pressure on the wages of university graduates, whereas decreasing the share of workers with low level of education moderates the downward pressure on their wages.",

On the other hand, the college wage premium increased in the 1979-87 period in which the growth of the supply of graduates was very small. Accordingly, they argued that, combined with the smooth increase in skill demand, the fluctuations in the growth of the supply of college graduates as a fraction of the labour force played an important role in explaining the large differences in the relative wages of college graduates between these two decades. Based on the findings of Pritchett (2001) and Katz and Murphy (1992), it can be argued that the education premium and wage inequality can increase or decrease depending on the differences between the relative growth rate of the supply and demand for the skills.",

            "text": "Another important implication of estimating the Mincerian regression is that if the demand for skill increases, returns to the unmeasured human capital such as unobservable skills linked to school quality, intrinsic ability and effort, which are the main reasons why workers with the same level of education and experience have different wages, increase as well. In particular, the rate of increase in returns to unmeasured characteristics is greater for individuals who have more education. In econometric terms, residuals in Minceriantype equations are empirically heteroskedastic. Lemieux (2002) and Martins and Pereira (2004) also note that school quality differences are more likely to be prevalent at higher schooling levels, because those are the stages that exhibit greater heterogeneity in schooling paths and school quality. Moreover, differences in school quality and the variance of residuals increase even more dramatically if admissions to schools get more selective at higher levels of education (as is in the case of Turkey). Therefore, changes in skill premiums affect wage inequality in two ways simultaneously; first, it affects the wage gap between workers with lower and higher education levels which causes an increase in the between-group inequality component. Second, it affects the wage dispersion within workers who have the same level of education but studied at schools with different qualities, which causes an increase in the within-group inequality component. 7 The argument of technological changes leading to polarization in wages and jobs requires a distinction between skills and tasks. Based on the models proposed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011) and Firpo et al. (2011), the tasks content of individual jobs can be determined by the occupations. These occupation-based task categories can then be incorporated in the standard Mincerian wage regressions to determine the impact of changes in the composition of these tasks categories and returns to them on wage distribution. In general it is argued that routine tasks are more vulnerable to technological changes compared with non-routine tasks; this is due to the fact that routine tasks require repeated physical strength and motions which computer and machines can perform (Goos et al., 2014). Job polarization would require the share of workers in the routine jobs to fall and the share of workers in the non-routine jobs to increase.",

In the JMP framework the changes in the distribution over time can be decomposed into three components: (1) changes in the distribution of observable covariates; (2) changes in the regression coefficients (returns to the observable covariates); and (3) changes in the distribution of residuals. However, the JMP decomposition does not account for changes in the distribution of covariates; their method thus ignores the problem of heteroscedasticity.",

First, like JMP it allows for the decomposition of changes in the entire distribution of wages rather than the decomposition of the change in the mean wages only. Second, unlike JMP it accounts for distribution of covariates, therefore, it can account for the problem of heteroskedasticity. Finally, it is also possible to decompose the changes in the residual distribution into the effect of the changes in unobservable characteristics and the effect of changes in returns to those characteristics. This then allows us to test the hypothesis of the human capital approach which asserts that a positive change in returns to observable skills exerts a positive impact on returns to unobservable skills.",

According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2013 (World Economic Forum, 2013), the female labour force participation rate in Turkey is 30 per cent and this ratio puts Turkey in the 123rd place out of 136 countries. Another problem that may cause selection bias is that there is a substantial share of unpaid family workers who traditionally work in the agricultural sector and are recorded as employed in employment statistics. According to TurkStat, for the year 2002, 49 per cent of total female employment consists of unpaid workers.

The new education system, which abolished the primary school and made secondary education compulsory, reduced the number of workers with only primary education for both men and women; whereas with the increasing accessibility of university education, the number of workers with a university degree increased for both genders.

Details of the occupation classifications used are given in Appendix B, Table B3. Women, relative to men are over represented in the abstract jobs, i.e., among professionals and technicians. This could be due to the selection process as only very high skilled women enter the labour force (40 per cent of the wage earning women have university education). Women are underrepresented in the routine jobs, such as plant and machine operators and assemblers. For both men and women, over time share of wage earners in abstract category has not changed; whereas the share of workers in the routine category has decreased. Table 2 presents the wage dynamics for men and women over time. The mean log wages for both men and women have increased over time; with a higher increase in the mean wages of women. The mean wage for men is higher than the mean wage for women in 2002 and this relationship reverses in 2010. This observation does not necessarily imply positive discrimination towards women. For instance, using the Structure of Earnings Survey 2006 conducted by the TurkStat, Kaya (2010) shows that on average women earn 2.5 percentage points more than men. She also argues that the higher average wage for women is a consequence of a composition effect as most of the female employees have a university degree, whereas male employees mostly have only primary education. By exploiting a quantile decomposition method, she finds that although the composition effect had a narrowing effect on the gender wage gap (favouring women), the effect of differences in the returns to characteristics had an increasing effect on the gender wage gap (favouring men) showing that the human capital characteristics of women are rewarded less than the characteristics of their male counterparts. Considering Kaya's (2010) findings, the reversal of relative wages between men and women between 2002 and 2010 can be explained by the higher increase in the share of university graduates among female wage workers.",

The omitted category in the model is the group of economically inactive men and women. The RRR tells us how the probability of choosing wage employment or unpaid family work (self-employment in the case of men) relative to being economically inactive changes if we increase the independent variable by one unit. If the RRR is >1, it means that the individual is more likely to be in wage employment or unpaid family work (selfemployment for men) and accordingly, if it is lower than 1, the individual is more likely to be economically inactive. Table 3 shows that for women education at all levels increases the probability of choosing wage employment. Having other members of the household in the wage sector, being head of the household and (for the year 2002) having a grandmother in the household also increases the probability of being in wage employment. The presence of children in the household aged 5 or less and between 5 and 11, being married, and presence of selfemployed members in the household all have a decreasing effect on wage employment. Table 4 shows that for men education at all levels, the presence of children in the household aged 5 or less, other members of the household in the wage sector, and being the head of the household increase the probability of choosing wage employment. Living in rural area and the presence of unpaid family workers in the household all increase the likelihood of being self-employed. For both men and women (Tables 3 and 4), the RRRs for educational categories are much smaller in 2010 than they were in 2002. This indicates that education does not increase the probability of being a wage worker (as opposed to being economically inactive) in 2010 as much as it did in 2002.",

The regression results (Table 5) show that the coefficients for the education variables decreased from 2002 to 2010 for men and women. The percentage decrease is more at lower education levels than    at higher education levels. For example, although returns to high school education for women (men) decreased by 76 per cent (65 per cent) over time, considering 2002 as the base year, the returns to university education decreased by 51 per cent (36 per cent). The coefficient for the abstract dummy is positive for both men and women; compared with the base category of routine workers, workers in the occupations classified as abstract earn more, ceteris paribus. For women, however, the premium of being in abstract jobs has fallen over time. The coefficient for the service dummy is negative (except for the 2002 female sample) showing that workers in the service group earn less than the workers in the routine occupations, ceteris paribus. For men, there has been no change in the returns to service sector jobs, whereas for women these returns have fallen over time. According to the wage regression results, compared with the base category of never married, being married has a positive effect on wages. Also, working in the formal sector (which is captured by the membership of social security system) has a positive effect on wages. The coefficient for the selection term is positive for men and women and statistically significant in each year, which means that the unobservable factors that affect selection into wage employment are positively correlated with the unobservable factors that affect wages.",

However, it is not possible to see to what extent these changes were responsible for the changes in the wage distribution without decomposing the changes in wage inequality. Table 6 reports the results of the aggregate decomposition using the method proposed by Lemieux. Looking at the 90-10 wage gap columns, for both men and women, the decomposition results indicate that the systematic part of the wage equation (sum of the covariate and the coefficient effects) explains about 58 and 55 per cent of the fall in inequality for women and men, respectively. Changes in returns to the observed characteristics (effect of coefficients) had a substantial share in explaining the decreasing inequality both at the upper tail (90-50 gap) and the lower tail (50-10 gap) of the wage distribution for men. For women, however, the changes in the coefficients was inequality increasing at the upper tail, and inequality decreasing in the lower half of the wage distribution. The effect of covariates, for men, is inequality increasing in the upper tail but inequality decreasing in the lower tail of the wage distribution. For women, the effect of covariates is negative and relatively small in the lower tail of the distribution but larger in the top tail of the wage distribution. Part of the explanation for the differences in these findings for men and women could be due to the fact that the proportion of women with university education (who are more likely to be in the upper tail) working in the wage sector is much higher than the proportion of men in the wage sector with university education. A further increase in the supply of educated women dampens the returns to them, whereas for men it does not.",

The pricing function has a considerable share in explaining the declining inequality at the top end of the distribution, whereas the size of this effect is found to be relatively small in the lower tail of the distribution, for both men and women. Table 7 presents the decomposition of changes in wage residuals. The skill pricing function explains almost all of the variation in the change in dispersion of wage residuals in the top half of the distribution; and almost 80-90 per cent of the variation in the bottom part of the distribution. This provides evidence that decreasing returns to human capital were accompanied by a decrease in pricing function of unmeasured characteristics.",

(2009); the results are presented in Table 8; Panel A reports the aggregate decomposition and Panels B and C report the detailed composition and coefficient effects, respectively, for the main factors: education, experience (age dummies, tenure, 11 and tenure square) and the occupational categories (routine, service and abstract). 12 From Panel A we can see that, for both men and women, there is a bigger fall in inequality in the bottom half (50-10) of the wage distribution and most of this is explained by the coefficient effect. For women, the covariate (composition) effect is negative and relatively more effective in the top half of the distribution; for men, the total composition effect is positive (inequality increasing) on the top half of the distribution and negative (inequality decreasing) in the bottom of the distribution. This is consistent with the Lemieux decomposition results. 13 In Panel B of Table 8 we have detailed composition effect. Overall the changes in the composition of educated workers, where there are more of them in the labour market, has been inequality increasing. The only exception is the top tail of the wage distribution for women. So, although it seems that for women, holding the returns to education constant, an increase in the educational qualification lowers difference between the workers who are in the top end of the distribution and those who are around the median of the distribution, the same cannot be said for men. This could be as women have had much bigger gains in university education relative to men. Composition effect of experience has been inequality decreasing for both men and women in the lower tail of the distribution but inequality increasing in the upper tail. Changes in the composition of workers in different occupation-based task categories contribute very little to the overall changes in inequality.",

As a result of the increase in supply, the wage inequality decreased in both the top and the bottom half of the wage distribution. The decrease in wage inequality was relatively low in the top half of the wage distribution, with most of the decline being concentrated in the lower half of the wage distribution.",

The second finding is in accordance with the skill price theory of Lemieux (2002) who argued that negative changes in the coefficient component exerts a negative impact on the residual component along the wage distribution, providing a measure for unmeasured skills pricing. Substantial change in skill pricing function may be linked to high-quality differences between universities.",

The second step of the method is to estimate the re-weighting factor which will then be used to modify the original sample weights and calculate the effect of changes in covariates. The concept of modifying sample weights, which are used to calculate sample statistics representative of the population, was originally proposed by DFL. This method attaches a new counterfactual weight to each individual to keep the distribution of characteristics constant and thereby makes it possible to account for changes in covariates. Their idea is to pool the samples of two periods and estimate a logit or probit model for the probability of being in the base year, using the same covariates as in the wage regression.

Presence of other household members in a specific sector is likely to influence the probability of employment within the sector. For instance, Calvo-Armengol and Jackson (2004) argue that, when information about jobs arrives individuals who are unemployed and directly hear of a job use the information to obtain a job; on the other hand, individuals who are already employed, depending on whether the job is more attractive than their current job, might take the job or else might pass information to one (or more) of their direct connections in the network. In accordance with this argument, it is possible that a wage worker (or a self-employed) may share the information about a waged employment (or self-employment) opportunity with his or her household members who are unemployed or self-employed.",

In this case a dummy for the presence of a grandmother in the household can aid in LFP of women by providing child care, but at the same time can be a deterrent for LFP as an elderly relative in the household may be an additional care responsibility for the women. For instance, using US data, Ettner (1996) shows that caregiving responsibilities for elders is a significant detriment to LFP for women. Similar results are echoed using the UK data by Heitmueller and Inglis (2007) and Heitmueller (2007). In case of China, on the other hand, Maurer-Fazio et al. 2011found that co-residence with elders had a positive effect on the LFP of women, especially married women. Similarly Marenzi and Pagani (2005) found that in Italy, the presence of elderly parents in the house can be beneficial for the LFP of women, especially those with pre-school children.

To compute the counterfactual residuals, JMP suggest the following procedure: first, the rank g is \u00bc F s \u00f0u is \u00de is computed from the empirical residual distribution in period s and then the residual at the same rank in the residual distribution in period t is picked. 14 Appendix B Additional tables ",
