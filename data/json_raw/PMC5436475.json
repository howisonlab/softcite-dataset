            "text": "Stroke remains the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. This fact highlights the need to search for potential drug targets that can reduce stroke-related brain damage. We showed recently that a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2) inhibitor attenuates tissue plasminogen activator-induced hemorrhagic transformation after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Here, we examined whether GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition mitigates early ischemia-reperfusion stroke injury and investigated its potential mechanism of action. We used the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to mimic transient cerebral ischemia. At 3.5 h after MCAO, cerebral blood flow was restored, and rats were administered DMSO (vehicle, 1% in saline) or GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor TWS119 (30 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after MCAO. TWS119 treatment reduced neurologic deficits, brain edema, infarct volume, and blood-brain barrier permeability compared with those in the vehicle group. TWS119 treatment also increased the protein expression of \u03b2-catenin and zonula occludens-1 but decreased \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation while suppressing the expression of GSK-3\u03b2. These results indicate that GSK-3\u03b2 inhibition protects the blood-brain barrier and attenuates early ischemia-reperfusion stroke injury. This protection may be related to early activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway."

Thus, identifying potential new drug targets is critical to developing therapies that will reduce stroke-related brain damage. It is known that early disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to acute cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury 1 In recent years, new strategies, such as delayed inhibition of VEGF signaling 2 , and new drug candidates, such as a novel analog of ginkgolide B (XQ-1H) 3 a novel adhesion molecule CEACAM1 4 , orosomucoid 5 , and lavandula officinalis ethanolic extract 6 , have been tested for their potential to protect the BBB in ischemic stroke models. Because the results from these studies have been promising, increasing attention is turning toward the identification of potential drug targets to protect the BBB after ischemic stroke.",

Body temperature was maintained at 36.5\u00b0C to 37.5\u00b0C throughout surgery. After a midline neck incision, the left common carotid artery (CCA) was isolated under a microscope and ligated with a 4-0 silk suture (Ethicon, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France). The external and internal carotid arteries were temporarily ligated with a 4-0 silk suture. An arteriotomy was performed proximal to the bifurcation of the CCA. A silicone-coated nylon monofilament (40 mm long, 0.26 mm diameter, Beijing Sunbio Biotech, China) was introduced through the arteriotomy and advanced into the internal carotid artery up to a distance of 18-20 mm to occlude the origin of the MCA. At 3.5 hours after this procedure, the rats were reanesthetized, the nylon monofilament was withdrawn to restore MCA blood flow, and TWS119 (30 mg/kg in 1% dimethy sulfoxide, Selleck, Houston, TX, USA) 17,18 or an equal volume of vehicle (DMSO) was administered. After surgery, the rats were returned to their home cages with free access to food and water. A third group of sham control rats underwent the same surgical procedure but the monofilament was not inserted and they were administered only DMSO.",

Previous studies have shown that thioredoxin 27 , anfibatide 28 , and inhibition of CD36-mediated inflammation 29 mitigate ischemic stroke injury.

While suppressing the expression of GSK-3\u03b2, TWS119 inhibited phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin and increased its total protein expression 38 . \u03b2-catenin is a key component for activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway 39 , and phosphorylation at Ser552 has been shown to induce beta-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and increases its transcriptional activity. However, other studies found that the Ser-552 phosphorylation site did not seem important for modulation of \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity 40,41 . In our study, we found that \u03b2-catenin was upregulated, whereas GSK-3\u03b2 and p-\u03b2-catenin were downregulated in the TWS119-treated group compared with levels in the vehicle-treated group, indicating that TWS119 may activate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by inhibiting GSK-3\u03b2 expression, reducing p-\u03b2-catenin, and enhancing \u03b2-catenin expression. The tight junction protein ZO-1 participates in the maintenance of BBB integrity and is the major transmembranal protein of tight junctions in the BBB 42 . ZO-1 controls angiogenesis and barrier formation 43 . However, whether Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling can regulate ZO-1 expression after BBB disruption in ischemic stroke is unknown. Our results showed that in the TWS119-treated group, a reduction in BBB permeability was associated with activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and upregulation of ZO-1 expression. The sequence of the signaling may need additional research in both in vitro and in vivo models of the BBB.",
