            "text": "TADB (http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/) is an integrated database that provides comprehensive information about Type 2 toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci, genetic features that are richly distributed throughout bacterial and archaeal genomes. Two-gene and much less frequently three-gene Type 2 TA loci code for cognate partners that have been hypothesized or demonstrated to play key roles in stress response, bacterial physiology and stabilization of horizontally acquired genetic elements. TADB offers a unique compilation of both predicted and experimentally supported Type 2 TA loci-relevant data and currently contains 10 753 Type 2 TA gene pairs identified within 1240 prokaryotic genomes, and details of over 240 directly relevant scientific publications. A broad range of similarity search, sequence alignment, genome context browser and phylogenetic tools are readily accessible via TADB. We propose that TADB will facilitate efficient, multidisciplinary and innovative exploration of the bacteria and archaea Type 2 TA space, better defining presently recognized TA-related phenomena and potentially even leading to yet-to-be envisaged frontiers. The TADB database, envisaged as a one-stop shop for Type 2 TA-related research, will be maintained, updated and improved regularly to ensure its ongoing maximum utility to the research community.",

The toxin genes invariably code for proteins, while matching antitoxin genes code for either antisense RNA or antitoxin proteins, resulting in classification as Type 1 or Type 2 TA loci, respectively. To date numerous phylogenetically and functionally distinct Type 2 TA systems have been identified through experimental and bioinformatics studies. In particular, since the advent of the genomics era it has become abundantly clear that Type 2 TA loci are richly distributed throughout the genomes of almost all free-living bacteria and archaea (3)(4)(5)(6)(7). Individual bacterial and archael genomes may harbor between 0 and >50 TA loci, with the vast majority encoding at least one TA locus. Consistent with the focus of this study, all further references within this report to 'TA' loci/genes/proteins refer solely to corresponding counterparts in 'Type 2 TA' systems.",

            "text": "TA toxin genes code for stable toxins that target either DNA replication or translation and these toxins are neutralized by short-lived protein antitoxins. As a general model for TA systems, the short-lived nature of the antitoxin ensures that cells which lose a TA locus and thus no longer produce the cognate 'immunity' antitoxin protein become susceptible to the stable toxin that has outlived the presence of its coding gene, resulting in toxin-mediated killing of the cell (2). Hence, prokaryotic organisms harboring TA loci are considered by some investigators to be 'addicted' to their native repertoire of TA loci. When present on plasmids and other horizontally acquired elements, TA systems are frequently viewed as 'selfish DNA' as many of these addiction systems have been shown to promote post-segregational killing of cells that have lost TA-encoding mobile genetic elements (8). A few TA loci have also been shown to confer within-host competitive advantage of the TA-encoding plasmid against other host permissive plasmids (9). In addition, chromosomally encoded TA pairs have also been shown or postulated to play multiple other functions. These systems can act to stabilize large horizontally acquired chromosomal regions, such as integrons, by selecting against their loss (10). TA pairs also provide immunity to the host cell from the same or related toxin encoded on other co-resident mobile genetic elements, thus acting as anti-addiction modules by allowing for the loss of one or more 'redundant' anti-toxin gene and its carrier mobile genetic element (2,11). A major area of active research in the TA field relates to a postulated regulatory role in bacterial stress physiology and the formation of dormant or 'persister' cells. Persister cells are involved in antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and several other important human pathogens (2,12). In Escherichia coli, persister cells can be formed by fluctuations in the expression of the HipA toxin, encoded by the hipBA TA tandem genes (13,14). Expression of HipA over a certain threshold in small numbers of cells causes dormancy (14). This subset of dormant cells is able to survive antibiotics that are active against growing cells, thus allowing the infecting organism to survive an antimicrobial assault and regenerate in time from a small number of surviving persister cells. Thus TA systems may well contribute towards stochastic variation within the population, gearing up individual subsets of organisms distinctly to favor survival of the population itself in the face of a likely wide diversity of unpredictable environmental, competitive and hostile challenges ahead.",

The data in TADB are derived from computationally predicted data sets and/or reports of experimentally validated TA genes. The BLASTP-identified 921 TA loci present in 147 sequenced genomes reported by Gerdes and co-workers (3,7) were first uploaded and classified into eight TA families. Next, the 5806 TA loci found in 604 genomes which had been assigned to 44 conserved TA domain pairs by Makarova et al. (4) were archived in TADB. The database was then further complemented with the data set of RASTA-Bacteria predicted TA loci identified in 883 annotated genomes. The RASTA-Bacteria algorithm utilizes RPSBLAST search and typical characteristics of TA loci, such as a two-gene, co-directed module coding for small proteins, to identify TA hits (6). RASTA-Bacteria TA pair hits with one score >70% and the other >60% were recorded by TADB, this strict cut-off yields broadly reliable TA candidates (6). Subsequently, the three data sets mentioned above were compared to ensure that only de-duplicated entries were included in TADB; identical TA loci from identical strains were eliminated.",

Supplementary TA loci identified by this literature search strategy included six TA pairs, absent from the first three data sets mentioned above, in M. tuberculosis H37Rv (NC_000962) that had recently been (12). At present, TADB contains details of 106 experimentally validated TA loci. Significantly, text mining has identified a further three TA families and three three-component TA families that belong to more recently identified TA families that would not be detected by the current version of RASTA-Bacteria. Our TADB database now includes members of 11 two-component and 3 three-component TA families. These TA families were classified based on toxin protein sequence similarity and tertiary structure, as described in the reviews by Gerdes et al. (1) and Van Melderen and Saavedra De Bast (2) (See http://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/TADB/ Introduction.html for more details). We have also classified TADB entries by a second classification system based on identification of TA pairs sharing cognate TA domains and independent of wider protein-level similarity as suggested recently by Makarova et al. (4), yet again offering the potential for future enhanced genome data mining and further expansion of the TADB database. TADB is expected to grow dramatically given next-generation sequencing-facilitated rapid acceleration in prokaryotefocused whole genome sequencing projects. As more information about the TA loci becomes available, the database will be expanded and improved accordingly.",

NC_009483) were analysed (Figure 1). Geobacter uraniireducens Rf4 is a Gram negative Delta Proteobacteria which can reduce uranium using acetate and other organic acids (Supplementary Figure S3C). Recently G. uraniireducens has been used experimentally in bioremediation of metal-contaminated subsurface environments (26). Tabulated ( Figure 1A) and graphically displayed ( Figure 1B) outputs of the 74 putative TA pairs with conserved TA domains (4) in G. uraniireducens Rf4 are as shown. In addition, a further eight putative TA loci predicted by RASTA-Bacteria (6) are also included in these outputs. The genomic context of a selected TA locus is readily investigated further by using Gbrowse, as shown for the putative TA locus Gura_2469-Gura_2470 ( Figure  1D). The putative toxin protein (yet to be experimentally characterized), Gura_2470, contains a MNT (minimal nucleotidyltransferase) domain, while its cognate putative antitoxin, Gura_2469, harbors a HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) domain (Supplementary Figure S3D)   Figure S3). Interestingly, a second putative TA pair Gura_2467-Gura_2468 (4) is located a short distance upstream of the Gura_2469-Gura_2470 TA pair. This second toxin, Gura_2467, contains a RES domain (COG5654), which contains three highly conserved polar groups (arginine, glutamate and serine) that could form an active site. Its matching antitoxin, Gura_2468, contains an Xre family HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain (COG5642). Remarkably, the two tandem putative TA loci are located within a single 18-kb dnd island, details of which are archived within dndDB ( Figure 1D) (23). Based on available data, the G. uraniireducens Rf4 dnd gene cluster (Gura_2472-2476) is likely to code for enzymes required for sequence-specific phosphorothioation of the DNA backbone (27). Consistent with a foreign origin, this 18-kb dnd island exhibits a lower G+C content (51%) than the genome average (54%) and codes for two likely transposase proteins (Gura_2461 and Gura_2462). Gura_2466, one of the island borne genes that lies close to the two TA loci, codes for an unusual 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. This protein possesses one of the smallest enzyme subunits known (28). Bacteria belonging to the Geobacter genus are often the predominant species in a wide diversity of subsurface sediments under metalreducing conditions (29). Given the abundance of phylogenetically diverse and functionally distinct TA loci within G. uraniireducens Rf4, it would be tempting to speculate that cumulative acquisition of TA loci and/or associated physically-linked mobile genetic DNA directly contributed to the environmental success and hardiness of Geobacter.",
