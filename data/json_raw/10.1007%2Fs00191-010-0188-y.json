Theoretical papers have argued that external actors represent important sources of information for innovation and thus a positive relationship between the extent of reliance upon external linkages and firm R&D performance should exist (Chesbrough 2003). Empirical research has instead looked at the nature of the linkages distinguishing between the role played by specific actors such as suppliers, customers (von Hippel 1988), and universities (Cohen et al. 2002;Laursen and Salter 2004) as sources of information or as partners in formal linkages such as technological agreements and R&D joint ventures (Freeman 1991;Hagedoorn 2002). However, the analysis of the role played by external linkages in the innovation process goes beyond the acknowledgement of their impact on firm performance and/or their nature and entails several aspects not all equally well explored in the existing literature.",

Although firms' reliance upon external linkages depends on internal research capabilities as well as on innovative investments (Cabagnols and Le Bas 2002), a relatively neglected aspect is the issue of what drives firms' selection of which actors to interact with both formally and/or informally. In this respect, it is important to understand whether or not the choice is specific to firms' innovation strategies (i.e. doing product or process innovation). Recent contributions (Shrolec and Verspagen 2008) suggest that significant differences exist with regard to firms' innovative strategies and highlight how interacting with different actors contributes to the definition of these strategies. The first aim of this paper is to understand whether and to what extent firms' reliance upon external linkages is influenced by their innovation strategies. By focusing on two types of external linkages-informal linkages (i.e. when actors are a source of information for innovation) and formal linkages (i.e. when actors are formal partners in R&D projects)-we will look at whether specific innovation strategies lead to interact with specific actors.",

Given the complexity of innovative activity, we should expect firms to draw upon several information sources and/or to combine formal and informal interactions. However, in the literature, linkages have generally been examined in isolation (the notable exception being Laursen and Salter 2006) or separately from formal partnerships (B\u00f6nte and Keilbach 2005, being the exception in this case), which provides a rather simple view of the innovation process. As a consequence, we know little about whether or not firms use linkages and information from different sources in a certain combination to carry out a specific innovative outcome. A better understanding of the role of external linkages in the innovation process should therefore result from taking into account the possibility that firms may simultaneously use many information sources as 'inputs' and also cooperate with several actors to carry out their innovative projects.",

Indeed, the literature on both national (Nelson 1993) and sectoral (Malerba 2002) systems of innovation stresses the notion that the institutional context shapes the pattern of innovation at the firm level. However, very few studies analyze whether national differences in the institutional and economic structures lead to systematic differences in the use of external partners, both as sources of information for innovation and as partners for collaboration. By considering four countries with different institutional organizations and market structures, we explore to what extent reliance upon formal and informal linkages is consistent across countries or whether systematic differences exist.",

The sample consists of firms that have innovated during the period 1998-2000 in four European countries: the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK. We consider the impact of the innovative strategies of firms on their reliance upon several external actors (viz. other enterprises of the group, suppliers, customers, competitors, universities, governmental institutes) as sources of information for innovation and as partners for innovation development. To account for the possibility that firms rely simultaneously upon several partnerships and sources as 'inputs' to the innovation process, a Multivariate Probit analysis is carried out for each country separately and then compared. The paper shows that firms with different innovative strategies rely upon different portfolios of formal or informal sources of information. At the national level, we find that innovative strategies seem to be more important for establishing formal links, while reliance on informal information sources varies across countries and industries, consistent with the view that national and industrial contexts shape the uses of information sources.",

Both institutional and technological contexts shape the organizational context in which innovation occurs (Whitley 2000). Indeed, industrial innovation can be understood as a process that involves search for information and interaction with both market based actors (i.e. customers, suppliers, competitors) and research institutions (i.e. universities and government) (Salter and Martin 2001). These interactions may be the consequence of formal alliances and/or cooperation agreements or they may occur in a more informal way. In both cases, they usually entail some form of knowledge and/or information exchange between the partners involved. Information acquired from external linkages differs in the form of access (i.e. informal or formal) as well as on the content being transferred (Swann 2002;Monjon and Waelbroeck 2003). In particular, informal use of sources is associated with the internal capabilities of firms to access and to absorb the information produced by other market or research organizations immediately. Instead, the knowledge derived from formal collaborations is associated with the use of ideas and developments resulting from access to infrastructures, human capital, and innovative capabilities of partners.",

The development of a specific type of innovation is not accidental, but reflects the innovative strategies of firms (Swann 2002;Tether 2002).

When product innovation is based on a recent scientific discovery, it often entails a formal collaboration with universities (Beise and Stahl 1999;Tether 2002;Monjon and Waelbroeck 2003). Firms that mainly pursue an imitation strategy instead seem to prefer horizontal technological information from competitors (Baldwin et al. 2002;Cabagnols and Le Bas 2002). Firms pursuing process innovation, which entails investments in machinery and equipment, seem to require mainly interaction with suppliers (Pavitt 1984;Malerba 1992). Swann (2002) finds that British process innovators tend to use universities both as a source of information and as R&D partners when compared to product innovators. Reinchstein and Salter (2006) further find that knowledge from suppliers enhances process innovations in firms with a cost-focus strategy, while the probability of doing process innovation is negatively associated with the use of customers as a source of knowledge.",

In their investigation of innovative strategies for a sample of European firms based on the CIS survey Shrolec and Verspagen (2008) have identified the presence of three possible approaches toward the use of external sources: a 'science based' approach, which combines reliance upon both universities and research institutes; a 'client and industry based' approach, which combines information from customers, competitors and other firms of the same group; and a 'supplier based' approach, which mainly relies upon information from suppliers. Each of these approaches is then linked in one or more types of innovation, with 'science based' firms participating more to joint projects with external organizations, 'client and industry based' firms doing more product innovation and 'supplier based' firms relatively more involved in the acquisition of machinery and equipment.",

In technological complex and uncertain environments, informal interaction is also considered to be beneficial, even in intermediate and mature industry stages (Pyka 2000). In supplier-dominated industries, firms rely mainly on suppliers as source of process-innovations (Leiponen 2002). Specialized-suppliers rely mainly on customers as sources of information to develop customized productinnovation and to solve technological problems for their clients (Riggs and von Hippel 1994).

In other words, different information sources reinforce each other (i.e. complementarity) or firms tap different sources to acquire information that is difficult to access such as, for example, information possessed by competitors (i.e. substitution). On the other hand, interaction with several actors might be the consequence of the fact that firms may do several types of innovation which differ in terms of novelty and integration of market and production. In other words, firms pursue different 'innovation strategies'.

We employ this question to identify the informal linkages (Inf). 2 The second question asked firms whether they had any co-operation arrangements on innovation activities with other enterprises or institutions during the same time period and to indicate the type of partner. We employ this question to identify the formal linkages (For).

Size is measured as the logarithm of total the number of employees. Large firms, which invest highly in innovative activities, are expected to search more for information, to rely relatively more upon university research, and to cooperate relatively more with several actors to innovate (Cohen et al. 2002;Leiponen 2002;Fontana et al. 2006).

By allowing disturbances across equations to be freely correlated, the method allows to test for the correlation between dependent variables conditional on a certain number of common explanatory variables (Galia andLegros 2004, p. 1193), thus providing insights into the extent of complementary of substitution between them. A positive (negative) correlation of the error terms between two equations is taken as an indication of complementarity (substitution) between the two dependent variables. 6",

Continuous-process includes all the other manufacturing activities.

Therefore, the analysis undertaken in this paper focuses on manufacturing firms with more than nine employees. As the CIS survey does not collect data on the sources of information and collaborative arrangements for noninnovators, we cannot proceed, as we wished, with the analysis for the noninnovative firms. Thus all the firms in our sample are innovative in the sense that they have introduced at least one innovation in the period covered by the survey. Our sample includes a total of 3963 firms (1633 firms for The Netherlands, 1005 firms for the UK, 559 for Sweden, and 766 for Norway).",

This is the main reason why we are estimating four separate sets of regressions. The marginal effects reported refer to the single equation for which they are documented (i.e. they reflect the increase in probability of a positive outcome in the single equation that is the result of the direct effect of a change in the exogenous variable to which the marginal effect refers). The marginal effects are calculated as is usual in Probit models. The standard errors of the marginal effects are calculated using the estimated variance-covariance matrix of parameters in the single equation.  Results for innovative strategies We start by looking at the relationship between firms' innovation strategies and reliance upon formal and informal linkages. Concerning novel product innovators (New_pdt), our results suggest that firms pursuing this strategy were relatively more likely than only process innovators (the reference category) to set up linkages with customers, and to a lesser extent with research organizations. This result holds across countries, although for Scandinavian firms only in the case of formal linkages. Swedish novel product innovators were also relatively more likely to engage in formal collaborations with competitors. Norwegian and Dutch novel product innovators also tended to rely upon (formal) collaborations with suppliers and other firms of the group. Firms that introduced improved products (Imp_pdt) present a different profile. Still, customers are important for these firms (both as a source of information and as formal partners). However, our marginal effects show that other actors matter as well. British and Dutch firms in this category tended to draw knowledge informally from competitors (the magnitude of the effect is the highest in the case of British firms) reflecting the importance of following an imitation strategy. 'Improved product innovators' were also less likely to tap informally into suppliers in the UK. Norwegian and Dutch firms that introduced improved products seemed relatively more likely to engage in formal collaboration with other enterprises of the group, in contrast to British firms.",

Competitors were also an important source of information for all firms, except for British and Swedish product and process innovators. (Formal) interaction with suppliers was relevant for Dutch firms in this group and to a lesser extent for Swedish and Norwegian firms.

In particular, in Sweden, the number of complementarities was the smallest for interactions among universities and governmental research institutes and other informal sources. In Norway, the number of complementarities was the smallest for informal interactions with suppliers and Customers.

Thus, the signs in each table correspond to the countries in which each coefficient was found to be significantly different from zero. Table 6 below reports the results for the subset of formal linkages. The emerging evidence in this case points to cross country similarity although some dissimilarities exist at the firm level.

Again, firm size and investment variety are, when significant, always positively associated to the probability of relying upon any external source of information. The biggest difference with respect to the previous results concerns the role of both innovative strategies and investment. In these cases, our results suggest the following. First, correlation is weaker when compared to the case of formal interactions since relatively fewer coefficients turn out to be significantly different from zero. Second, in those cases in which correlation is significant, there is no single strategy which can be pursued to tap any source of information. On the contrary, tapping each information source seems to require the implementation of a different mix of strategies. Third, the implementation of a specific mix is mainly country Reported signs are for those countries whose corresponding marginal effect is significantly different from zero specific, as no strategy (or mix of) exists that is common to every country (as it happened with novel product introduction in the case of formal linkages). All in all, the previous considerations point to the following conclusions. No clear cut pattern seem to emerge concerning the relative importance of firm specific effect vis-\u00e0-vis country effects in the establishment of formal and informal external linkages. However, the establishment of formal linkages seems to be the consequence of firm specific characteristics especially related to innovation strategies, and, to a lesser extent, investment, rather than of country specific characteristics. This finding is consistent with the results of Shrolec and Verspagen (2008), who pointed to the role of firms strategies in explaining pattern of innovation rather than sectoral and national factors. The establishment of informal linkages instead seems to depend relatively less on firm characteristics. In this case, differences across national and sectoral innovation systems are so strong that differences still remain even after controlling for firm strategies and other characteristics.",

In this paper, we have empirically analyzed both these possibilities using a sample of innovating firms from four European countries (Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and the UK).",

In particular, novel product innovators tend to have formal and informal interaction with customers and with research organizations to a lesser extent. Firms that introduce only improved products seem to regard informal linkages with competitors (both formal and informal) and with customers as more important in the innovation process. In comparison, firms that innovate in both product and process tend to rely relatively more on customers and public research organizations. We have also found differences in the portfolio of external linkages across firms active in different industrial and technological contexts. At the national level, our analysis points to the important role played by firm characteristics and innovative strategies particularly in the establishment of formal linkages with external actors. In the case of informal linkages firms specific characteristics tend to matter less.",

These results, although preliminary and in need of further corroboration, suggest some managerial and policy implications. On the managerial side, if firms' capabilities to use certain types of linkages and the adequacy of knowledge provided by external actors differ across countries and sectors, then the decision to enter into new markets (internationalization, delocalization or diversification) may create problems of identification, access and process of external sources of information. Therefore, firms may need to complement these decisions with investment in wider search and collaborative activities, as well as in new routines for enhancing the processing of external information. On the policy side, our results suggest not only that public research organizations in different countries have different capabilities to provide specific relevant innovative knowledge, but also that their capabilities depend on the quality and function of the interaction among different market actors. It should be the task of policy makers to nurture and to reinforce these interactions.
