            "text": "Objective: Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the leading viral cause of neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, with the most severe and permanent sequelae being those affecting the cerebrum. As the fetal immune reactions to congenital CMV infection in the brain and their effects on cerebral development remain elusive, our aim was to investigate primitive innate immunity to CMV infection and its effects on cerebral corticogenesis in a mouse model for congenital CMV infection using a precise intraplacental inoculation method. Methods: At 13.5 embryonic days (E13.5), pregnant C57BL/6 mice were intraplacentally infected with murine CMV (MCMV). Placentas and fetal organs were collected at 1, 3, and 5 days postinfection and analyzed. Results: MCMV antigens were found frequently in perivascular macrophages, and subsequently in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). With increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and proinflammatory cytokines, activated macrophages infiltrated into the infectious foci. In addition to the infected area, the numbers of both meningeal macrophages and parenchymal microglia increased even in the uninfected areas of MCMV-infected brain due to recruitment of their precursors from other sites. A bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation experiment demonstrated that MCMV infection globally disrupted the self-renewal of NSPCs. Furthermore, BrdU-labeled neurons, particularly Brn2 + neurons of upper layers II/III in the cortical plate, decreased in number significantly in the MCMV-infected E18.5 cerebrum. Interpretation: Brain macrophages are crucial for innate immunity during MCMV infection in the fetal brain, while their aberrant recruitment and activation may adversely impact on the stemness of NSPCs, resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders."

            "text": "Intrauterine infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading viral cause of developmental disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) in humans, 1,2 and more frequently causes disabilities than do other well-known childhood disorders, such as Down syndrome. 3 Although human CMV (HCMV) can infect multiple organs, the most severe and permanent sequelae after congenital infection are those affecting the cerebrum, such as microcephaly, epilepsy, and mental retardation. [4][5][6][7] These sequelae are found more frequently in infants infected during the first trimester, a critical period for cerebral corticogenesis, 8 than in those infected during the later trimesters. 9 In cerebral corticogenesis, neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ) generate the cerebral cortex through their \"stemness\"; that is, through their proliferation, migration, and differentiation. 10 Therefore, congenital HCMV infection can be a teratogenic factor for cortical malformations that result in the abovementioned sequelae.",

[11][12][13] Although growing evidence indicates that inflammatory reactions triggered by infectious agents have serious impacts on immature developing brains and are possibly related to brain malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, [14][15][16][17] most of the evidence is based on studies using bacterial and viral mimics, such as lipopolysaccharide and polyinocinic-polycytidylic acid. 14,17 In other words, fetal immune reactions to neuroinvasion with a live virus and the influence of the immune reactions on cerebral corticogenesis have not yet been well investigated. 18 Although studies on human subjects have obvious limitations, and while CMV has strict species specificity, in vivo model systems using mouse embryos and neonates infected with MCMV have nevertheless shed light on the neuropathogenesis of congenital CMV infection. 19,20 Previously, we developed a mouse model of intraplacental MCMV infection to simulate transplacental HCMV infection and to investigate CMV neuropathogenesis. 21 In this model, neonatal mice infected with MCMV in utero exhibited growth retardation and microcephaly in a fashion similar to that observed in association with congenital CMV infection in humans. However, there have been no precise pathological or immunological analyses of the effects of congenital CMV infection on fetal brain development.",

In the first set of mice, inoculation with MCMV-Smith was performed at E11.5, E12.5, and E13.5, and the fetuses were collected at 3 dpi.

Although MCMV infection induced a significant increase in the number of fetal brain macrophages in the uninfected areas of the brain except for the marginal zone (MZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) (Fig. 4D), the numbers of BrdU-labeled proliferating macrophages in the uninfected areas of the MCMV-infected fetuses were significantly reduced in comparison with those in the mockinfected fetuses (Fig. 4E).

CD11b + cells in the MCMV-infected cerebra both at 3 dpi and 5 dpi were significantly increased by~1.6 times those in the mockinfected cerebra, and accounted for~3% of the total number of cerebral cells. The monocyte/macrophage population in the MCMV-infected cerebra was increased by nearly twice of that in the mock-infected ones. The microglia population in the infected cerebra was also increased by~1.5 times. In both mock-and MCMVinfected cerebra, the percentages of microglia were larger at 3 dpi, but smaller at 5 dpi, than those of monocyte/ macrophages. Intermediate microglia accounted for onl\u1ef9 6% of the CD11b + population, and no significant difference was observed between the populations in mock-and MCMV-infected cerebra. The proportions of the other CD45 high leukocytes, including natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, B cells, and granulocytes, in the all cerebral cells were very small in comparison with the monocyte/ macrophage and microglia populations and again no significant differences were observed in their populations between the mock-and MCMV-infected cerebra at 3 dpi (Fig. 5C). In addition,~90% of the monocyte/macrophage population in both mock-and MCMV-infected cerebra clearly expressed both F4/80 and Iba-1 antigens (data not shown). This suggests that the monocyte proportion of the monocyte/macrophage population was very low as they usually express CD11b but not Iba-1. 33 Thus, the flow cytometric data are consistent with the histological findings showing the MCMV-induced dramatic and aberrant increases in brain macrophages, including microglia.

The monocyte/macrophage population in the MCMV-infected cerebra was exclusively responsible for the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6. Expression of iNOS and INF-b were also prominent in the monocyte/macrophage population, and substantially observed in the other populations. In addition, the monocyte/macrophage population contributed to the expression of IL-10. These data appear to well explain the activated immune status of the monocyte/macrophage population in the infectious foci. In contrast, the microglia contributed little to the mRNA expression of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines, except for iNOS, INF-a, and -b. The expression of iNOS in the microglia of the MCMVinfected cerebra was reduced compared with that of the mock-infected cerebra. Except for the aberrant but minor expression of INF-a and -b, these results indicated a silent or suppressive immune status of microglia in the MCMV-infected fetal cerebrum. The CD11b \u00c0 leukocyte population was primarily responsible for the expression of INF-c. Although this population had been supposed to consist of CD3 + /CD11b \u00c0 T cells and B220 + /CD11b \u00c0 B cells, we found B cells were almost absent (Fig. 5C). Therefore, INF-c, probably derived from T cells, contrib-uted to the expression of iNOS during the late phase of MCMV infection.",

Furthermore, we found that MCMV infection impairs their stemness by global and indirect mechanisms during the late cerebral corticogenesis. As the global and indirect mechanisms for the impairment of the stemness of NSPCs in MCMV-infected fetal brain, we would like to propose the disturbances caused by soluble mediators from activated macrophages and the alteration of the brain microenvironment due to In our mouse model, multifocal and disseminated MCMV infectious foci were formed through the whole fetal body, including the brain, as shown in congenital HCMV infection. 41 In the cerebrum of our mouse model, MCMV infectious foci were distributed along blood vessels throughout the brain parenchyma and meninges, with the periventricular area as a preferred site of MCMV infection. The infectious foci mostly consisted of infiltrated macrophages, and only a part of them were infected with MCMV. Since immature myelomonocytic leukocytes have been shown to participate in MCMV dissemination via the bloodstream, 42 it is supposed that these immature monocyte/macrophage lineage cells may contribute to transvascular invasion of blood-borne MCMV into the fetal cerebrum.",

            "text": "In the present study, it is worthy of note that focal MCMV infection of the fetal cerebrum globally induced a dramatic and aberrant increase in brain macrophages, including microglia, and this increase was dependent on the recruitment of precursor cells from other sites rather than in situ proliferation. Activated macrophages were few in number compared with the other brain macrophage populations, but exclusively expressed MHC class II and iNOS, indicating macrophage activation. These activated macrophages in the infectious foci were the primary source of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IL-1b, which have been reported to suppress MCMV replication. 43,44 Considering the delayed expression of INF-c, we speculate that the expression of these mediators may be first induced by the direct interaction between MCMV and macrophages, perhaps via mechanisms involving the activation of pattern recognition receptors. 45 This macrophage activation was restricted to the infectious foci with active MCMV replication, as reported previously for the MCMV infection of the postnatal brain, 30 and possibly prevented the spread of MCMV infection. It is likely that both the activated macrophages in the infectious foci and the recruited meningeal macrophages derive from the fetal liver where the major fetal hematopoiesis occurs after E12, instead of from the yolk sac in mice. 46 In contrast to the activated macrophages, microglia showed no potent activation but improperly appeared in the CP associated with an aberrant increase in their number, suggesting this improper and excessive distribution of microglia could adversely affect cerebral development. However, the source of the increase in microglia, whether primitive macrophages in the yolk sac or fetal liver monocytes, remains to be clarified. 47 With regard to the neuropathogenesis of congenital CMV infection, great attention has been paid to NSPCs, 19,20 as HCMV preferentially infects the VZ/SVZ in the brains of congenitally infected patients. 48 A loss of stemness in NSPCs caused by direct CMV cytopathicity has been demonstrated in previous in vitro studies. [11][12][13] Our intraplacental MCMV infection model simulated transplacental HCHV infection, and demonstrated that intraplacentally inoculated MCMV preferentially infects NSPCs in the developing fetal cerebrum and directly impairs their stemness. At the same time, global and indirect impairment of NSPCs was observed in the MCMVinfected fetal cerebra. Postnatal mouse models infected by intraventricular MCMV injection showed delayed cerebellar development with decreases in granular neuron proliferation and migration 40 and improved development of MCMV-infected cerebellum in response to suppression of inflammation by glucocorticoid treatment. 49 These reports are highly suggestive of an impact by focal MCMV infection on CNS development via broad inflammatory responses. The dysregulation of immune mediators has been suggested to adversely affect neurodevelopment. 50 In this study, the induction of iNOS, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-10 from activated macrophages infiltrating infections foci was the earliest primitive innate immune response against MCMV infection in the fetal cerebrum. These immune mediators, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-10, are known to adversely influence the stemness of NSPCs and are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy. [51][52][53][54][55] In addition to the activated macrophage response, MCMV infection in the developing fetal cerebrum induced improper and excess distribution of microglia, which physiologically regulate NSPCs and supports cerebral cortical development. 56,57 iNOS expression was suppressed in these aberrantly recruited microglia during MCMV infection. NO produced by iNOS is an important player in neuronal development. 58 These aberrantly recruited microglia may disturb normal brain development via alterations in the microenvironment not only due to their improper and excessive distribution in the fetal brain, but also due to their adverse immune response.",

Four cellular populations, monocyte/macrophage (CD45 high /CD11b + , Mo/ M\u03c6), microglia (CD45 low /CD11b + , Mi), CD11b \u00c0 leukocyte (CD45 high / CD11b \u00c0 , CD11b \u00c0 Leu), and other cerebral cells (CD45 low /CD11b \u00c0 , Cr) were obtained from MCMV-infected fetal cerebra at 5 dpi using a flow cytometric cell sorting device as described in Materials and Methods. mRNA expression levels in each cell population were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized against the expression of GAPDH gene. Expression levels of iNOS and inflammatory cytokines in each cell population were expressed as fold changes against those of mock-infected cerebra. Mean AE SEM of three fetuses are shown. *P < 0.05 compared with mock-infected fetuses. MCMV, murine cytomegalovirus; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. diseases remain unclear. Our present study implies that inflammatory responses during embryogenesis can trigger microglial dysregulation and that such dysregulation may result in certain kinds of neuropsychiatric diseases. It would be interesting to see the relationship between neurophysiological and neuroethological outcomes and aberrant microglia status in the brains of adult mice that survive congenital MCMV infection in our model.",
