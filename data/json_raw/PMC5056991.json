DNM2 mutations cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy which is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and histopathological features including nuclear centralization in absence of regeneration. No curative treatment is currently available for the DNM2-related autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. In order to develop therapeutic strategy, we evaluated here the potential of Spliceosome-Mediated RNA Transsplicing technology to reprogram the Dnm2-mRNA in vitro and in vivo in mice. We show that classical 3\u2032-trans-splicing strategy cannot be considered as accurate therapeutic strategy regarding toxicity of the pre-trans-splicing molecules leading to low rate of trans-splicing in vivo. Thus, we tested alternative strategies devoted to prevent this toxicity and enhance frequency of trans-splicing events. We succeeded to overcome the toxicity through a 5\u2032-trans-splicing strategy which also allows detection of trans-splicing events at mRNA and protein levels in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that the Spliceosome-Mediated RNA Trans-splicing strategy may be used to reprogram mutated Dnm2-mRNA but highlight the potential toxicity linked to the molecular tools which have to be carefully investigated during preclinical development.",

            "text": "Heterozygous mutations in DNM2 gene are responsible for the autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (MIM# 160150). 7 Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy exhibiting a large clinical spectrum, and characterized by the presence of centrally located nuclei in a large number of muscle fibres. 7,8 No curative treatment is available and the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease are still poorly understood. The human DNM2 (OMIM #602378) gene is composed of 22 exons encoding four major splice isoforms by using a combination of two alternative splice sites. 9 To date, more than 20 mutations, affecting six exons spread over the MID, PH, and GTPase effector domain domains, have been identified in centronuclear myopathy patients. 8 The most frequent mutation located in exon 11 (p.Arg465Trp in the MID) accounts for 30% of patients. 8 The same mutation, also harbored by exon 11 in mouse, was used to develop a Knock-In-Dnm2 R465W mouse model of the disease. 10 The knock-out of Dnm2 in mouse is lethal during embryonic stage while heterozygous Dnm2 knock-out mice do not develop phenotype. 11,12 Besides, overexpression of wild-type Dnm2 is also deleterious in mouse tissues. 13 These data argue for a tight regulation of the DNM2 expression level compatible with cell homeostasis. Consequently, future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-linked autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy will require maintenance of the DNM2 gene product in physiological range. Spliceosome-mediated RNA trans-splicing (SMarT) appears suitable to reach such a requirement.",

SMarT technology was used to reprogram 5\u2032, 18 3\u2032 19 or internal 20 mRNA sequences. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-trans-splicing strategies to reprogram Dnm2 transcripts in vitro and in vivo. We show that 5\u2032-SMarT is a suitable approach for reprograming the Dnm2 transcript. However, assessment of optimized strategies to increase efficiency and avoid the PTM self-translation will be crucial for further preclinical development.",

PTM contain: (i) a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, (ii) antisense sequences (AS) complementary to intron 10 except for the negative control lacking the AS sequence (noAS-PTM), (iii) a conserved yeast branch point sequence (BP), (iv) a polypyrimidine tract, (v) a strong canonical 3\u2032 acceptor splice site (3\u2032-SS), 15 and (vi) the wild-type cDNA sequence of the mouse Dnm2 (exons 11 to 22) fused with a Flag epitope motif. The sequence from exon 12 to exon 22 was modified by codon optimization. These nucleotide modifications, preserve the translated protein sequence, increase the transgene expression, and allow detection of chimeric trans-spliced sequence by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence of exon 11 was unchanged in order to retain putative endogenous Exonic Splice Enhancer sites (Figure 1a). We designed five distinct AS (AS2 to AS6) of ~150 nucleotides in the 3\u2032 part of intron 10 (from \u2212450 to +2 relative to exon 11). The AS3 masks the endogenous BP, polypyrimidine tract, 3\u2032-SS, and the 3\u2032 intron/exon boundary of exon 11 (Figure 1b). The targeted intron is involved in alternative splicing. Therefore, the expected trans-spliced product would contain the Dnm2 endogenous sequence from exon 1 to 11 including either exon 10 or 10 bis followed by Dnm2 optimized sequence (exons 12 to 22) and the Flag sequence.",

Taking advantage of the Dnm2 modified sequence in PTM, we used oligonucleotides which amplify specifically trans-spliced transcripts (E8-F/ E14Opt-R) or both cis-and trans-spliced transcripts (E8-F/ E11-R) (Figure 1b).

However, western blot detected several additional bands migrating at molecular weight ranging from ~25 to 50 kDa (Figure 2b). Their presence for all the 3\u2032-PTM, with or without AS, suggested that these bands came from the PTM itself rather than illegitimate trans-splicing events.

Muscle integrity was evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining on TA transverse sections 1.5 months later. Saline-injected control TAs showed normal myofibres except in small areas showing nuclear centralization compatible with muscle regeneration induced by needle injury. The number of fibres with nuclear centralization was drastically more important in TAs injected with AAV-PTM regardless of the AS sequence (reaching the totality of the muscle for the AS5 and AS6) ( Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S1a,b). To ensure that the nuclear centralization resulted from fibres regeneration, we looked at muscle integrity earlier after the injection. Indeed, a massive necrosis occurred 15 days after injection (Figure 3a). An intermediate level of regeneration was observed with AAV-AS2-3\u2032-PTM and AAV-noAS-3\u2032-PTM (see Supplementary  Figure S1a,b).",

These observations attested the virus loss in accordance with the regeneration level observed in Hematoxylin and Eosin (Figure 3b and Supplementary  Figure S1a,b). However, 1.5 months after the injection, low level of viral particles was still detectable for AAV-AS2-3\u2032-PTM and AAV-AS4-3\u2032-PTM (58 and 21 vg/ng, respectively) (See Supplementary Figure S1c). Consequently, further RT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to determine if these low remaining amounts of viral particles sustain transsplicing events. The trans-splicing specific primers detect trans-spliced mRNA at the expected size for TA injected with AAV-AS2-3\u2032-PTM and AAV-AS4-3\u2032-PTM (Figure 3c). Even after a second round of PCR, no trans-spliced mRNA was detected for the other AS, the noAS and saline-injected TA (not shown). Sequencing of the trans-spliced products obtained for AS2 and AS4 confirmed the trans-splicing reaction in both cases. Trans-splicing occurred either after the Dnm2 endogenous exon 10 (isoform 1) or 10 bis (isoform 2) for both AAV-AS2-3\u2032-PTM and AAV-AS4-3\u2032-PTM (Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S2a). The unexpected amplicon obtained for the AAV-AS5-3\u2032-PTM (15 days after the injection) corresponds to an illegitimate trans-splicing event joining exon 8 to exon 11 (see Supplementary Figure S2b).",

The GFP ORF starts with a Kozak initiation context and ends with a series of three successive STOP codons to optimize the translation ending. It was therefore expected that only the GFP (and not the toxic peptides) is translated from the mRNA exported to the cytoplasm, with no consequence on trans-splicing events occurring in the nucleus (Figure 4a). We produced these constructs for AS2 and noAS previously used in the 3\u2032 classic strategy and called them \"GFP-inserted 3\u2032-PTM\". PTM translation was assessed using anti-Flag western blot on protein extract from 3T3 cells transfected with AS2-GFPinserted-3\u2032-PTM construct. The GFP insertion succeeded to avoid the multiple PTM translation (Figure 4b). However, we have detected novel bands around 65 kDa. In silico analysis identified three potential donor splice sites in the GFP sequence that could lead to cis-splicing with predicted GFP-Dnm2 fusion peptides compatible in size with the observed bands (Figure 4b and Supplementary Figure S3b). Moreover, immunofluorescence showed a partial colocalization of Flag and GFP in the cytoplasm (not shown), in agreement with coexpression of GFP and cis-spliced GFP-Dnm2. Finally, we failed to detect a band at the expected molecular weight for a trans-splicing event, even after Dnm2 immunoprecipitation (see Supplementary Figure S3a).",

No PTM translation was detected by western blot using anti-Flag antibody, regardless of the presence of polyadenylation site or intron (Figure 6a and not shown). In addition, trans-spliced protein was detected at the expected molecular weight for the AS3+int-5\u2032-PTM construct after Dnm2 immunoprecipitation (Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure S4a). Expression of Dnm2 trans-spliced transcripts was assessed by nested RT-PCR 48 hours after transfection. We amplified bands at the expected size for most of the 5\u2032-PTM constructs using trans-spliced Dnm2 specific primers (Figure 6b). No product was amplified in untransfected cells and with the two noAS control PTM (with or without pA). Semiquantitative RT-PCRs amplifying cis-spliced endogenous Dnm2-mRNA, PTM-RNA, and Gapdh mRNA showed similar expression level in the different conditions (Figure 6b). Amplicon sequencing confirmed trans-splicing events between optimized exon 13 and endogenous Dnm2 sequence ( Figure  6c and data not shown). Moreover, sequencing revealed that the natural alternative splicing of exon 13 bis is preserved since we observed exclusively heterozygous sequences corresponding to isoform 2 (including exon 13 bis) mixed with isoform 4 (without exon 13 bis) ( Figure 6b,c and not shown), except for cells transfected with AS2-\u2206pA-5\u2032-PTM showing only isoform 2.",

Rare cells are flag-positive with the noAS-PTM containing pA site suggesting a weak PTM translation but no flag-positive cell was detected using the noAS-\u2206pA-PTM. We thus assume that flag staining observed in cells transfected with AS-\u2206pA-PTM represents trans-spliced Dnm2 protein.

Hematoxylin-Eosin staining showed that areas containing fibres with internalized nuclei were similar for PBS-injected TAs (i.e., ~5% of the muscle section) and TAs injected with AAV-5\u2032-PTM with or without pA site (i.e., 0.75-13% of the muscle section) (Figure 7a).

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplifying endogenous Dnm2-mRNA, PTM-RNA, and Gapdh mRNA showed comparable level of expression in all conditions (Figure 7b). Sequencing of trans-spliced transcripts showed expected chimeric sequence with splice between optimized exon 13 and endogenous sequence.

Similar observations using the noAS-PTM, suggest toxicity linked to PTM translation rather than illegitimate trans-splicing. Parts or totality of Dnm2 PH, GTPase effector domain, and proline-rich domain domains can be translated from the 3\u2032-PTM coding sequence depending of the start codon used (Figure 1b). Therefore, we can hypothesize that truncated peptides can trap Dnm2 partners or act as dominant negative mutants to impair Dnm2 functions. In addition, muscle toxicity could be linked to other mechanisms such Despite of massive viral loss secondary to necrosis-regeneration, 38 low level of 3\u2032 trans-spliced mRNAs was detected indicating that intron 10 is an accurate targetable region for Dnm2 3\u2032-trans-splicing. This result led us to assess alternative ways to avoid PTM translation. The \"GFP-inserted 3\u2032-PTM\" strategy was developed based on the monocistronic rule for gene expression in eukaryotes stating that only the protein encoded closest to the 5\u2032 end gets expressed. 39 This approach partially succeeded since the translation of multiple truncated peptides from the PTM was suppressed, supporting their translational origin, but did not significantly reduce muscle toxicity. One may hypothesize that toxicity results from the production of toxic peptides identified by western-blot and generated by cis-splicing of the GFP-inserted 3\u2032-PTM. However, this modified 3\u2032 strategy may be a good path to prevent PTM expression for future SMarT development.",

The two intronic regions targeted in our study are involved in alternative splicing (i.e., intron 10 and 13 in the 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-replacement strategies, respectively). In the 3\u2032-replacement study, an exclusive alternative splicing after either exon 10 or 10 bis is observed in vitro and in vivo suggesting that the location of the AS guides the spliceosome in favor of one event. Conversely, the chosen AS for 5\u2032-replacement do not bias the natural splicing, since the large majority of trans-spliced product sequences shows both splice isoforms in vitro. However, contrasting again with our in vitro results, the splicing is altered in vivo, since either trans-spliced isoform 4 or isoform 2 are produced. The reasons of this discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo contexts are unclear and could rely on differences between splicing regulations between 3T3 cells and muscle. Therefore, maintenance of natural alternative splicing in region targeted by SMarT needs to be carefully considered in future in vitro screening as well as in in vivo models which do not always mirror the in vitro situation.",
