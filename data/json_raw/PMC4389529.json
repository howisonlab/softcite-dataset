In the first day, patients performed the heart rate variability assessment followed by a cardiopulmonary exercise test. In the second day, patients performed a resting echocardiography. Heart transplant recipients were eligible if they were in a stable condition and without any evidence of tissue rejection diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy. Patients with pacemaker, noncardiovascular functional limitations such as osteoarthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were excluded from this study. Results: Sixty patients (68% male, 48 years and 64 months following heart transplantation) were assessed. Multivariate analysis selected the following variables: receptor's gender (P=0.001), receptor age (P=0.049), receptor Body Mass Index (P=0.005), heart rate reserve (P<0.0001), left atrium diameter (P=0.016). Multivariate analysis showed r=0.77 and r2=0.6 with P<0.001. Equation: peakVO 2 =32.851-3.708 (receptor gender)-0.067 (receptor age)-0.318 (receptor BMI) + 0.145 (heart rate reserve)-0.111 (left atrium diameter).",

This is attributed to physical deconditioning resulting from previous heart failure [3] , a low chronotropic response (as a result of a cardiac denervation, also accessed by heart rate variability) [4] and, in many cases, impairment in cardiac function after transplantation [2] . The cardiac systolic function of the transplanted heart seems to be normal in most patients, while diastolic dysfunction appears to be present in most of the transplanted heart. Diastolic dysfunction was recently identified as one of the factors that seem to influence negatively the maximal and submaximal exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients [5,6] .

The signals were transmitted to a receiver and then to a computer for subsequent analysis. Data analysis: The RRi sequence of length n=256 beats was selected for each subject. The length of greatest stability was chosen from the central region of the time series. The mean and variance of the RRi were also calculated. HRV spectral analysis: The HRV frequency domain analysis was performed with an autoregressive model [9,10] , on previously selected RRi sequences. Two main spectral components were considered: low frequency (LF -from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF -from 0.15 to 0.50 Hz) that represent the sympathetic and vagal modulations, respectively [11] . The spectral components are reported as normalized units (LFun and HFun) and LF/HF ratio. Normalization consisted of dividing the power of a given spectral component (HF or LF) by the total power minus the power below 0.04 Hz, and multiplying the ratio by 100.9 All patients presented a respiratory rate in the frequency range of HF band of HRV.",

There are no data in the literature regarding diastolic function (E/E' ratio) and time of cardiac transplantation. We believe the fact that our patients are well treated and compensated for comorbidities such as hypertension, the E/E' ratio remained constant throughout the follow-up. In a curious way, our study showed no association between peak VO 2 and the time of transplantation, but a positive association between peak VO 2 and cardiac sympathetic reinnervation through heart rate reserve. These data are quite relevant for a deeper understanding of the behavior of exercise capacity over time of transplantation. It seems that the real factor influencing exercise capacity is sympathetic reinnervation and not simply the time of transplantation. This information let us believe that for the same time following heart transplant, we will have more and less reinnervated patients. Consequently we will have patients with higher and lower exercise capacity.",

Certainly, the assessment of the cardiac function during exercise would bring important information to the understanding of the relationship between E/E' ratio and in exercise capacity of heart transplant recipients. In addition, further investigation of the left atrium would be relevant for a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the limitation of exercise capacity. This study was also limited by not assessing the vascular function and peripheral muscle metabolism (oxygen extraction). Tests such as the kinetics of O 2 , would be useful in future research to evaluate the influence of the \"periphery\" in the exercise capacity of transplanted patients.",

Heart rate reserve was the unique variable that was positively associated with peak VO 2 . This data suggest the importance of the sympathetic reinnervation in peak VO 2 in heart transplant recipients.",
