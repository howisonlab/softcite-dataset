EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Immunohistochemistry, contractile activity in isolated bladder and urodynamics were determined before and after cyclophosphamide treatment. F16357 was administered intravesically during the acute phase of inflammation, and effects on PAR1 and PAR1-related bladder contraction evaluated 24 h after cyclophosphamide injection. Urodynamics and associated voided volumes were recorded 7 and 24 h after cyclophosphamide. KEY RESULTS In control conditions, PAR1 was present only in some umbrella cells. Cyclophosphamide disrupted the urothelium and expression of PAR1 by all remaining urothelial cells. After F16357 treatment, urothelial damage was absent and PAR1 immunoreactivity similar to control tissues. Thrombin and TFLLR-NH 2 induced bladder contractions. These were increased in inflammatory conditions and antagonized by F16357 in a concentration-dependent manner. In telemetric experiments, furosemide increased urine production and voiding frequency for 60 min, 7 h after cyclophosphamide injection. Intravesical administration of F16357 blocked these changes with a return to a physiological profile; 24 h after cyclophosphamide, the volume of micturition was still lower with no increase in number of micturitions. F16357 30 \u03bcM reduced the number of micturitions and improved bladder capacity, but did not affect diuresis. Under similar experimental conditions, lidocaine 2% induced comparable effects. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS PAR1 is expressed in rat bladder, overactivated in inflammatory conditions and involved in bladder function and sensation. F16357 could represent an interesting candidate for IC treatment.",

Several pathological situations such as interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are characterized by pelvic pain, inflammation and detrusor dysfunction. The symptoms of IC and BPS constitute a number of idiopathic heterogeneous disorders with unknown cause that are manifest as increased urinary frequency and urgency (Hanno et al., 2015). Unfortunately, at the present time, there is no effective treatment for these diseases.",

In rats, an acute i.p. injection of CYP induces signs of pelvic pain (Saitoh et al., 2010), inflammation (Lecci et al., 2000;Auge et al., 2013) and alterations in urodynamic parameters (Hu et al., 2005;Dornelles et al., 2014). Importantly, this acute model demonstrates many features of IC in humans. We have recently described a telemetric approach to evaluate, in the same conscious animal, urodynamic parameters in control conditions and after CYP injection (Monjotin et al., 2016). We now use this approach to evaluate drugs acting on lower urinary tract dysfunctions induced by CYP.",

In all these experiments, no analgesia was given to the animals after CYP injection because evaluation of the effects of compounds was essentially based on bladder function related to sensation/pain. Nevertheless, a behavioural evaluation of the pain was performed regularly (presence of ptose, chromodacryorrhoea, hunched back, abdominal licking and/or piloerection) to ensure that internal critical end points were not exceeded and in compliance with ethical procedures. Moreover, animals were placed under a heating lamp for at least 4.5 h after CYP injection to avoid CYP-induced hypothermia. No animals had to be killed due to ethical issues. The rationale for the chosen group size, to obtain a representative evaluation of pharmacological effect of tested compounds, was evaluated by a statistician and approved by the internal ethical committee. For preliminary in vitro experiments related to immunohistochemistry, in which no statistical analysis was performed, only three animals per condition were used, with a total of n = 9 animals. For other experimental conditions, the number of animals used is presented in figure legends. In organ bath chamber experiments, at least one strip was treated with vehicle on each day of the experiment to ensure the reproducibility of the test, thus explaining the difference in group size between F16357treated strips and vehicle-treated strips in both physiological and inflammatory conditions. The difference in group size observed between physiological and inflammatory conditions in organ bath chamber experiments was related to the anticipation of a major impact of CYP on animal welfare below the end points at which the animals would need to be killed. However, no animals reached these end points, and the supplementary strips were included in the results. In the telemetric experiments, the difference in group size was due to a loss of bladder pressure signal. Randomization of animals was performed on body weight for in vitro experiments. No randomization was performed for telemetric experiments because the animals were reused for different groups.",

At T + 2.5 h, animals were anaesthetized by isoflurane 1.5% (0.5 L\u2022min \u00c01 per animal), and the bladder was emptied. A catheter (PE-10) was inserted in the bladder through the urethra, and the intravesical administration of saline was performed. The urinary meatus was clamped, and the catheter was removed. After 60 min of exposure, the clamp was removed, the bladder was emptied and the animals were returned to their home cage to recover. Animals were placed under a heating lamp after the CYP injection for up to 4.5 h in order to avoid CYP-induced hypothermia; 24 h after CYP injection, the animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg\u2022kg \u00c01 , 1 mL\u2022kg \u00c01 ) and killed by cervical dislocation and the bladders excised and fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The bladders were then washed in PBS and transferred to solutions with progressively higher sucrose concentrations (10, 20 and 30%) to act as a cryopreservant. The tissues were subsequently 'snap-frozen' using isopentane. Tissue sections (7-8 \u03bcm) were cut at \u00c025\u00b0C, placed on polylysine-coated slides and air-dried. Sections were washed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), TBS Tween (TBS-T) and subjected to a TBS wash cycle for 5 min at each stage. Primary antibodies were diluted with PBS with 1% triton-X. Combinations of primary antibodies were then placed on each slide and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Primary polyclonal antibodies included were against PAR1 (1:100; Santa Cruz, Cat No. sc-8202), vimentin (1:5000; BioGenex, Cat. No MU074-uc), COX1 (1:100; Santa Cruz, Cat No. sc-1752) and neuronal NOS (1:500; Santa Cruz, Cat No. 648) were used. These antibodies were chosen because they have been characterized at the molecular level for the specific epitope (see manufacturers data sheets). After overnight incubation, sections were washed in TBS, TBS-T and TBS and incubated with appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies: mouse, goat and rabbit primary antibodies were visualized using donkey anti-mouse/goat/rabbit IgG antibody conjugate (Molecular Probes) Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 for 1 h at room temperature.

In control rats, the urothelium, stained with an antibody to NOS [green appears as a multilayered structure, arrows: (+)]. PAR1-IR can be seen (red), but this is localized to the umbrella cells. Not all umbrella cells were PAR1-IR with large areas showing no PAR1-IR. No PAR1-IR was detected in cells of the lamina propria or muscle layer; 24 h after CYP treatment, there was a clear disruption and damage to the urothelium ( Figure 2B). Cells of the urothelium have been lost, and the barrier is absent or reduced to a singlecell layer. Such changes are often associated with an expansion of the lamina propria, but there appears to be little damage to the sub-urothelial interstitial cells. All of the urothelial cells remaining after CYP were strongly PAR1-IR. The 'punctate' distribution was lost. Qualitatively, these observations suggested an increased expression of PAR1 in the basal urothelial cells after CYP exposure. Intravesical administration of F16357 (30 \u03bcM) 2.5 h after CYP treatment appeared to induce less damage ( Figure 2C). PAR1-IR was again restricted to a small population of umbrella cells. Note that, however, in the section illustrated, the lamina propria was still expanded ( Figure 2C). Therefore, the local administration of F16357 appeared to prevent the sequence of events underpinning urothelial damage possibly by preventing the overexpression and activation of PAR1.",

The intravesical administration of F16357 30 \u03bcM reduced the micturition frequency and increased the individual voided volumes to restore the so-called basal urodynamic parameters (P < 0.05 for both); however, the micturition amplitude and the total voided volume were not significantly affected by the F16357 treatment ( Figure 6A-D). When the furosemide challenge was repeated at 24 h, the total voided volume was reduced by about 60% when compared with the 7 h time point, thus affecting the number of micturitions (only 4 \u00b1 1). This reduction in total voided volume, despite a reduced voiding frequency, was in accordance with data previously obtained, and corresponded to a significant fall in the rate of urine production as previously reported (Monjotin et al., 2016). The intravesical administration of F16357 30 \u03bcM significantly reduced the micturition frequency and increased the individual voided volumes in a comparable magnitude as those at 7 h (P < 0.05). Again, the amplitude of micturition and the total voided volume were not affected by this pharmacological treatment ( Figure 6E-H).

Secondly, functional studies demonstrate a physiological response involving PAR1 both in isolated bladders and in conscious freely moving rats. Interestingly, the compound F16357 exhibited a concentration-dependent antagonism of PAR1 and demonstrated a clear improvement of the symptoms of bladder sensation induced by CYP. Proteases like tryptase (Boucher et al., 1995;Okragly et al., 1999) or neutrophil elastase (Kuromitsu et al., 2008) are released during inflammation, and their levels are found to be increased in urine from IC patients. Thrombin, another serine protease with a high affinity for PAR1, plays an important role in the induction of inflammation and pain (Vergnolle, 2009). In rat bladder, the distribution of PARs is well established for PAR2, PAR3 and PAR4, but PAR1 has yet to be further characterized (D'Andrea et al., 2003;Moffatt, 2007;Vera et al., 2010). Nevertheless, the presence of PAR1 was confirmed in rat bladder by Vera in 2010 and has recently been shown to be involved in bladder pain by Kouzoukas in 2015, but its role in bladder function has yet to be established (Vera et al., 2010;Kouzoukas et al., 2015). In human bladder cells (Urotsa), all four subtypes of PAR have been well characterized (Vera et al., 2010).",

To the best of our knowledge, the functional implication of PAR1 has never been reported in rat bladder contractility, and PAR1 effects are selectively and concentration-dependently antagonized by F16357. In the present experimental conditions, a smaller bladder contraction was obtained with thrombin than with TFLLR-NH 2 , which could be explained either by the presence of natural anti-protease or by an off-target effect (Benezra et al., 1993;Lafleur et al., 2001;Tran and Stewart, 2003). At the concentrations tested, a difference in efficacy between the two agonists is not related to an insufficient concentration of thrombin because 3 UI\u2022mL \u00c01 was supramaximal (data not shown). Another explanation could also be related to a difference in the mechanism of PAR1-induced activation because TFLLR-NH 2 does not display any enzymatic activity. Moreover, rhythmic contractions were reported by Nakahara in 2004 after trypsin-induced bladder contractions in CYPtreated rats (Nakahara et al., 2004). In the present work, thrombin and TFLLR-NH 2 also induced rhythmic detrusor contractions that were reduced by F16357. All these data confirm the role of PARs and especially PAR1 in rhythmic contractions. In these conditions, the concentration-dependent antagonism induced by F16357 on detrusor contractility demonstrates that PAR1 is a very interesting target for the management of bladder overactivity and the exacerbation of the bladder sensitivity described in IC patients (Grover et al., 2011). Nevertheless, in order to evaluate the involvement of bladder sensitivity in the bladder contractility, the relationship between PAR1 expression in the urothelium and detrusor function warrants further investigations.",

The bladder is not filled artificially with saline but urine following as part of an endogenous diuresis. Consequently, bladder filling and emptying operate in a more physiological condition (Buyuknacar et al., 2008;Andersson et al., 2011). As a result, the timing of a void is determined by the animal, a conscious decision, and not only by activation of reflexes when the bladder is full. The decision of the animal to void therefore involves the integration of multiple inputs: painful sensation and volume sensations (Eastham and Gillespie, 2013).",

This change in the voiding pattern is consistent with the idea that the introduction of painful bladder sensations, as a result of the CYP-induced cystitis, contributes to the decision to void (Cox, 1979;Saitoh et al., 2010;Pessina et al., 2015). F16357 was tested in this stringent rat model of IC, in order to evaluate the effect of a PAR1 antagonist. These telemetric data demonstrate a very clear beneficial effect of a short and local administration of F16357 on voiding pattern and urodynamic parameters, thus supporting an hypothesis for the involvement of a PAR component (Dattilio and Vizzard, 2005;Vergnolle, 2009), especially PAR1 in the bladder pain sensation (Kouzoukas et al., 2015).

These observations could probably be induced by a major effect of CYP on kidney function (Kim et al., 2011).",

In humans, intravesical instillations of lidocaine 2% may interrupt the self-perpetuating neuroinflammatory cycle presented in IC (Henry et al., 2015). In the current experimental model, the comparable effects obtained with lidocaine and F16357 confirm the involvement of pain sensation in the modification of the voiding pattern. Collectively, these results show that PAR1 antagonism plays a key role in the control of bladder pain either by a direct effect on receptor or by an indirect mechanism with inhibition of some inflammatory cytokines such as MIF (Kouzoukas et al., 2015).",

Hence, F16357 could represent an interesting candidate for IC/PBS treatment because it improves most of the pathological features, namely, pelvic pain, inflammation and detrusor dysfunction.",
