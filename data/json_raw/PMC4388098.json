            "text": "Background: The hospitalized elderly are at risk of functional decline. We evaluated the effects and care costs of a specialized geriatric rehabilitation program aimed at preventing functional decline among at-risk hospitalized elderly. Methods: The prospective nonrandomized controlled trial reported here was performed in three hospitals in the Netherlands. One hospital implemented the Prevention and Reactivation Care Program (PReCaP), while two other hospitals providing usual care served as control settings. Within the PReCaP hospital we compared patients pre-implementation with patients post-implementation of the PReCaP (\"within-hospital analysis\"), while our nonrandomized controlled trial compared patients of the PReCaP hospital post-implementation with patients from the two control hospitals providing usual care (\"between-hospital analysis\"). Hospitalized patients 65 years or older and at risk of functional decline were interviewed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months using validated questionnaires to score functioning, depression, and healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL). We estimated costs per unit of care from hospital information systems and national data sources. We used adjusted general linear mixed models to analyze functioning and HRQoL. Results: Between-hospital analysis showed no difference in activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) between PReCaP patients and control groups. PReCaP patients did have slightly better cognitive functioning (Mini Mental State Examination; 0.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.6]), lower depression (Geriatric Depression Scale 15;-0.9 [95%-1.1 to-0.6]) and higher perceived health (Short-Form 20; 5.6 [95% CI 2.8-8.4]) than control patients. Analyses within the PReCaP hospital comparing patients pre-and post-implementation of the PReCaP showed no improvement over time in functioning, depression, and HRQoL. One-year health care costs were higher for PReCaP patients, both for the within-hospital analysis (+\u20ac7,000) and the between-hospital analysis (+\u20ac2,500). Conclusion: We did not find any effect of the PReCaP on ADL and IADL. The PReCaP may possibly provide some benefits to hospitalized patients at risk of functional decline with respect to cognitive functioning, depression, and perceived health. Further evaluations of integrated intervention programs to limit functional decline are therefore required."

            "text": "The \"PReCaP\" is a preventive program supplementary to usual care for hospitalized elderly that has been developed and implemented in three departments (ie, geriatrics, internal medicine, and cardiology) of a regional hospital in the Netherlands. The supplementary nature of the PReCaP means that the patient receives usual care from the professionals of the department they are staying in, and, in addition, receive PReCaP care from a multidisciplinary team that is not connected to a specific department but active across hospital departments. Thus, the care this team provides is \"supplementary\" to the usual care patients already receive in their specific departments. The PReCaP aims to reduce hospital-related functional decline among the hospitalized elderly by offering multidisciplinary, integrated, and goal-oriented care focused on physical, social, and psychological domains of functioning. 13 Important elements of the PReCaP are the early identification of patients at risk of functional decline using the Identification Seniors At Risk -Hospitalized Patients questionnaire (ISAR-HP 14 ), intensive follow-up treatment for elderly patients with complex problems at a prevention and reactivation center (PRC), multidisciplinary geriatric expertise, support for informal caregivers, and geriatric case-management from hospital admission to well after discharge. 13,15 Previous studies have evaluated these elements separately and found each one successful (see Table S1). 6,8,12,16 setting The Vlietland Hospital (hereafter referred to as the \"PReCaP hospital\") is a 450-bed regional hospital, which employs 131 medical specialists and 1,782 staff members. The hospital has a geriatric unit with 22 beds (including four beds for patients suffering from delirium), direct access to hospital replacement care, and provisions for follow-up in primary care through the PReCaP (de Vos AJ et al, unpublished data, 2014).",

This period served as a baseline study before implementation of the PReCaP to allow for within-PReCaP-hospital-analysis over time, to choose a suitable instrument to identify elderly patients at risk of functional decline, and to generate data needed for power calculations. 17 We then conducted a prospective nonrandomized controlled trial including patients aged 65 years or older admitted to either the departments of geriatrics, internal medicine, or cardiology of the PReCaP hospital post-implementation, or to one of the two control hospitals providing usual care, between February 2011 and September 2013.

Nevertheless, it was a limitation as well, since many elements of the PReCaP proved difficult to implement. 15 Problems in implementation might be due to the inherent nature of a supplementary complex intervention such as the PReCaP. The PReCaP focuses on functioning, continued assessments throughout hospital stay, avoiding complications, promoting independent functioning, and providing support throughout hospital stay and after discharge, which all have may contributed to prevention of hospital-related disability. 8 We aimed to evaluate the PReCaP as a whole instead of its separate elements. 5,32 Nevertheless, geriatric patients often have multiple problems in different domains (eg, cognitive, physical, social). These problems are difficult to isolate and may change back and forth over time. 7,8 Therefore, the implementation and evaluation of geriatric care programs such as the PReCaP are complicated. In addition, patient characteristics, social support, resources, and environment will also influence the patient's ability to live independently at home after discharge. 33 It is therefore unclear whether differences in cognitive functioning, depression, and perceived health between the intervention and control hospital groups can be attributed solely to implementation of the PReCaP.",

            "text": "Furthermore, practical problems interfered with implementation of the PReCaP, such as lack of capacity within the PReCaP hospital (eg, too few trained personnel available). In addition, the intervention hospital dealt with many changes (eg, financial problems, and hospital board as well as management changes) that hampered the implementation of the intervention. 15 Moreover, improvements in geriatric care offered in the control hospitals limited the contrast between the PReCaP hospital and control hospitals. Our results may have been influenced by this lack of contrast between the intervention hospital and control hospitals. Transitions within the three hospitals that were unrelated to the study may have influenced outcomes. For example, the SFG has started scaling up its specialized clinical geriatric care in light of the implementation of national guidelines on elderly care. The lack of contrast between the hospitals in provided health care was supported by a qualitative analysis of hospital processes. Results of this analysis showed that the three hospitals, even though they used different methods, all screened patients at admission in order to develop personalized care. They all used similar standardized care plans concerning the nursing care process, with the exception of the Vlietland Hospital geriatric unit and the SFG cardiology unit, in which patient independence in daily activities was emphasized more. Even though the Vlietland Hospital employs three geriatricians and three geriatric nurses who provide specialized geriatric care for older patients hospital wide, the control hospitals employ consultative psychiatric nurses who often provide advice to (psycho-) geriatric patients. Furthermore, all three hospitals employ transfer nurses who coordinate the post-discharge follow-up care of older patients. Finally, coordination and management, even though different in the three hospitals, were comparable in their ultimate goals and thus lacked contrast.",

The earlier literature suggests that providing consultative multidisciplinary care supplementary to usual care in different hospital departments might be less effective than providing multidisciplinary care from day 1 via a dedicated integrated team from within an inpatient geriatric unit. 8 The PReCaP contains multidisciplinary geriatric care, including regular multidisciplinary meetings, and the use of goal-attainment scaling to plan individualized care. Nevertheless, since this care was offered supplementary to usual care, implementation of the PReCaP elements often started days after the patient was admitted, which may have reduced effects on patient outcomes. Another, similar suggestion concerns home rehabilitation as an effective setting for improving mobility and functioning, 34 since patients will be better able to benefit from rehabilitation if they are able to live in their own home environment. The case manager might facilitate rehabilitation in the home setting, and can contact external organizations to offer home rehabilitation for a patient who they think might benefit. Nevertheless, this would be additional treatment after the PReCaP ends and as such is not a part of the PReCaP, which for the most part takes place during the hospital stay.",

Even though the PReCaP possibly provides some psychological benefits to hospitalized patients at risk of functional decline, we should aim to further study prognostic factors and underlying gradients of frailty or risk of functional decline, thereby allowing and improving the design of integrated interventions that can mediate this risk and improve patient outcomes. Further studies should evaluate treatments focused on both medical condition and domains of reactivation care but tailored to the needs of risk groups -for example, patients with cardiovascular diseases. 36 Consequently, patients may have a better prognosis after discharge. This will prevent dependence on informal and formal health care and associated costs and instead will help older people remain independent in daily life as long as possible after hospital discharge.",
