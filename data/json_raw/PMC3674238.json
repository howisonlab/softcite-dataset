            "text": "Establishment of cell polarity-or symmetry breaking-relies on local accumulation of polarity regulators. Although simple positive feedback is sufficient to drive symmetry breaking, it is highly sensitive to stochastic fluctuations typical for living cells. Here, by integrating mathematical modelling with quantitative experimental validations, we show that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a combination of actin-and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-dependent recycling of the central polarity regulator Cdc42 is needed to establish robust cell polarity at a single site during yeast budding. The guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor pathway consistently generates a single-polarization site, but requires Cdc42 to cycle rapidly between its active and inactive form, and is therefore sensitive to perturbations of the GTPase cycle. Conversely, actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 induces robust symmetry breaking but cannot restrict polarization to a single site. Our results demonstrate how cells optimize symmetry breaking through coupling between multiple feedback loops.",

            "text": "he Rho-type GTPase Cdc42 is a central regulator of cell polarity in animal and fungal cells 1,2 . At the G1-S transition in the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc42 becomes concentrated in a cortical cap that defines the future bud site 3,4 . Cdc42 binds to various effectors that control essential morphogenetic processes, such as polarized membrane transport 5 , assembly of a septin ring 6 and fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane 7,8 . To fulfill its functions, Cdc42 must constantly cycle between GTP-bound/active and GDP-bound/inactive states. In budding yeast activation of Cdc42 is controlled by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Cdc24 and Cdc42 hydrolytic activity is promoted by four GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Bem2, Bem3, Rga1 and Rga2 (ref. 7). In addition, Cdc42 is extracted from membranes by a single Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), Rdi1 (refs 9,10).",

In addition, polarization of wild-type Cdc42 depends on actin-based secretion, particularly in the absence of Bem1 (ref. 14) or Rdi1 (ref. 17). However, although a role for membrane transport in polarity establishment has been widely established 18,19 , its relevance for polarization of wild-type yeast cells is still controversial 11,16,[20][21][22] . A negative role for actin in cell polarization has even been proposed based on endocytosis of polarity regulators 20,23 or dilution of Cdc42 in the cap region 24,25 . Although such mechanisms provide explanations for travelling waves 23 or oscillating polarization patches 24 , they cannot account for the positive role of actin during the actual process of symmetry breaking-both in the presence and absence of Bem1driven feedback 13,14 .",

We established assumptions and parameter values for this model through genetic analyses, in vitro reconstitution and live cell imaging. Predictions from the model were tested and validated experimentally. We demonstrate that the establishment of a stable and unique polarization axis requires coordination of two pathways. Actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is very robust, but does not reliably result in formation of a single-polarization site. In contrast, GDI-dependent recycling is sensitive to changes in the GTPase cycle of Cdc42 but faithfully generates a unique polarization site. Our results suggest that correct polarity establishment is achieved through coupling of multiple feedback loops.",

Overexpressed Cdc42 might be buffered by its GDI, which is generally found in a 1:1 complex with its substrates in the cytosol 32 . Actin and Rdi1 have been proposed to act in parallel during polarity maintenance 17 . To systematically investigate the connection between Rdi1-and actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42, we analysed genetic interactions of Cdc42 and its regulators with synthetic genetic arrays 33 . Genetic lesions in all examined components had a negative impact on processes linked to actin functions ( Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, few physical interactions of Cdc42 regulators with actin-associated proteins have been reported ( Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S2). These results indicate that, in addition to the role of Cdc42 in formation and polarization of actin structures, Cdc42 signalling and actin-mediated transport processes also act in parallel during essential cellular processes. Rdi1 exhibited interactions with several components involved in endocytic recycling ( Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S1), consistent with a role in actin-independent recycling of Cdc42 during polarity establishment. To test this, we studied synchronized yeast cells expressing GFP-Cdc42 fusions ( Supplementary Fig. S1b-d), and monitored Cdc42 cap formation 14 . As expected from a defect in extraction of membrane-bound Cdc42, Drdi1 cells accumulated Cdc42 on membranes (Fig. 2b). Nevertheless, polarization kinetics were unaffected in Drdi1 cells and in cells expressing Cdc42 R66E , a mutant unable to interact with the GDI 34  (Fig. 2b). However, depolymerization of actin with latrunculin B (LatB), which has moderate effects on control cells 14  (Fig. 2c), blocked polarization in Drdi1 and Cdc42 R66E -expressing cells (Fig. 2c). A similar synergistic effect was observed when exocytosis was blocked using a temperature-sensitive allele of MYO2 (myo2-16, Fig. 2d).   accumulation in aberrant endocytic compartments, confirming passage of Cdc42 through the endocytic system ( Fig. 2e).",

However, many mechanistic details of actin-based membrane recycling are unknown, rendering detailed models highly speculative. Importantly, the proposed dilution effect of vesicle delivery on the Cdc42 cap 21 is not supported by our experiments, as Cdc42 cap intensities are significantly higher in control cells compared with cells, in which actin-mediated transport processes are disrupted (Fig. 3a). A recent study has also shown the feasibility of polarity establishment if Cdc42 exhibits non-uniform diffusion 36 . We therefore opted to simulate actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 using a coarse-grained approach (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Tables S8, 9). We assumed that membrane-bound Cdc42 molecules are delivered to the plasma membrane from internal membranes along actin cables. Sites of enhanced cable nucleation are generated at a rate that depends on the amount of active Cdc42 at the respective nucleation site. Endocytosis was modelled with a constant extraction rate.",

In the presence of catalytic amounts of GAP domain, GTP-Cdc42 was extracted at nearly the same rate as GDP-Cdc42 ( Fig. 3d), indicating that GTP hydrolysis is ratelimiting for GDI-mediated Cdc42 extraction.

            "text": "Cdc42-GTP/-GDP on internal membranes and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue was sufficient to dissociate soluble GDI-Rac1 complexes, allowing free GMPPNP-bound Rac1 to bind to liposomes ( Supplementary Fig. S2a). Conversely, nucleotide exchange by the GEF was strongly reduced in the presence of GDI ( Supplementary Fig. S2b), consistent with competition for binding to the switch II region of the GTPase 40 . These results cannot be directly transferred to living yeast cells. However, we found that the dominant-negative mutant Cdc42 D57Y , which sequesters its GEF 43,44 , could no longer be extracted by the GDI and was instead slowly recycled via actinmediated transport 14,17  (Fig. 3e). Our results are consistent with competition between GEF and GDI for binding of Cdc42-GDP. We therefore implemented interference of GEF activity with Cdc42-GDI interaction by increasing the rate of Cdc42 membrane association in regions of high Cdc42 activity (equivalent to high GEF concentrations). GDI-mediated polarization is of considerable theoretical interest 28,30,45 . Our results indicate that GDI-mediated recycling of Cdc42 depends on the latter's catalytic cycle, and both GAP and GEF need to be regulated to allow rapid shuttling between membrane and cytosol. In a previous model, positive feedback in Cdc42 activation was based on non-linear recruitment of Cdc24 to Cdc42-GTP 28,46 . The model predicts slower turnover of Cdc24 if Cdc42 activity is increased. However, we found that the level of GEF expression or actin or Cdc42 activity had no influence on Cdc24 turnover at the polarized site ( Supplementary Fig. S3b), indicating that feedback must be implemented in a different manner. Our model assumes linear recruitment of the GEF to Cdc42-GTP, but instead incorporates two GEF-mediated, and experimentally supported, positive feedback loops for activation and physical recruitment of Cdc42 (dashed boxes in Fig. 3c), respectively. A short comparison of features and limitations in various models for yeast cell polarity is shown in Supplementary  Table S10. A detailed review on this subject has also been published recently 47 . Determination of quantitative model parameters. Having established a general structure for the two Cdc42 recycling pathways we set out to determine realistic values for the parameters involved in their operation. We aimed to base all model reactions ( Supplementary Table S8) and parameters ( Supplementary Table S9) on experimental evidence. Several parameter values and data concerning the distribution of Cdc42 between cell compartments were taken from the literature (Supplementary Methods). The remaining values were fitted to quantitatively reproduce characteristics of control cells and of the individual recycling pathways observed in LatB-treated or Drdi1 cells (Figs 4,5). In all conditions our model was able to recapitulate polarization profiles of Cdc42 with realistic background levels and values for cap width and cap height (Fig. 4). In addition, the polarization response was robust to considerable variations in the individual parameter values ( Supplementary Fig. S4).",

            "text": "The mobility of Cdc42 is a major element in any dynamic polarization model. We performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to monitor Cdc42 recycling. In agreement with previous measurements 14,17 , recovery of Cdc42 fluorescence in control cells occurred with an average T/2 of 2.2 s, and was independent of Cdc42 expression level (Fig. 5a,b, Supplementary Fig. S3a). Disruption of actin structures with LatB led to a slightly increased T/2 of 2.5 s (Fig. 5a,b, Supplementary Fig. S3a). This slower recovery was proposed to result from greater accumulation of Cdc42 in caps 21 . However, Cdc42 cap intensities in LatB-treated cells were significantly reduced (Fig. 3a), supporting a positive role for actin in Cdc42 polarization. Perturbation of Cdc42-Rdi1 interactions by deletion of RDI1 or the use of the Cdc42 R66E mutant drastically slowed recovery to a T/2 of 10 s (Fig. 5b), confirming previous work on polarity maintenance 17 . Our results confirm that Rdi1-and actindependent Cdc42 recycling act in parallel during polarity establishment and show that the pathways act on different time scales. All values for Cdc42 mobility could be accurately reproduced in our model ( Fig. 5c-e, Supplementary Table S3).",

            "text": "Validating the model. Our model was able to reproduce characteristics of Cdc42 mobility and distribution under various experimental conditions. Next, we searched for model predictions that we could validate experimentally. One critical aspect of the model is the fact that GDI-mediated extraction is restricted to GDP-Cdc42, predicting loss of polarization in LatB-treated cells at very low rates of hydrolysis (Fig. 6a). The hydrolysis rate in control cells, estimated by fitting values for cap height/width and FRAP times, was 2.74 s \u00c0 1 (grey dashed line Fig. 6a). To check the model-based prediction we reduced GTP hydrolysis on Cdc42 by deleting BEM2, the GAP with the largest number of genetic interactions with actin ( Fig. 2a). Cdc42 in Dbem2 cells was able to polarize efficiently, albeit with slightly reduced speed (Fig. 6b). However, when actin was disrupted most Dbem2 cells could no longer polarize (Fig. 6b). Similar results were obtained when monitoring Cdc24 or Bem1 ( Supplementary Fig. S3d). In our simulations polarization occurred over a wide range of hydrolysis values, with the control rate being close to the maximum permissible before polarization breaks down (Fig. 6a). To study the impact of changes in hydrolysis rates on a more quantifiable parameter, we tested the effect of deleting BEM2 on Cdc42 mobility. The model predicted a gradual increase in T/2 upon reduction of the GTP hydrolysis rate (Fig. 6c). This slowdown was expected to be more pronounced in LatB-treated cells. In agreement with this prediction, in Dbem2 cells and the slowacting mutant Cdc42 G60A (ref. 48), FRAP halftimes increased to 6.7 and 6.8 s, respectively, ( Fig. 6d, Supplementary Table S3). In our model this recovery rate corresponds to a roughly 16-fold decrease in the rate of GTP hydrolysis to (grey dashed lines in Fig. 6c). At this hydrolysis rate, Cdc42 in LatB-treated cells is predicted to recycle with a T/2 of 8.7 s-a value close to the measured 9.6 s for LatB-treated Dbem2 cells ( Supplementary  Table S3). Hence, our results indicate that the contribution of actin to Cdc42 recycling is increased in Dbem2, likely due to reduced extraction of active Cdc42 by its GDI.",

First, increased Cdc42 activation should strongly increase the percentage of Drdi1 cells that form multiple polarization sites (Fig. 7c, blue curve). Second, even cells with a functional GDI should form multiple caps if rates of GTP hydrolysis are reduced sufficiently (Fig. 7c, black curve). Rdi1-mediated recycling of Cdc42 alone was unable to generate multiple stable caps in our simulations. The formation of multiple caps at lower hydrolysis rates can be explained by the reduction or loss of the ability of GDI-mediated recycling to restrict cap formation to a singlepolarization site and the enhanced nucleation of actin at higher levels of Cdc42-GTP. To increase Cdc42 activity in Drdi1 cells, we exploited the known cell cycle-dependent activation of Cdc42 after the G1/S transition 49,50 . We released Drdi1 cells from G1 arrest in the presence of LatB to prevent immediate polarization and washed the drug out at different times to allow polarization with varying initial Cdc42 activity ( Supplementary Fig. S5a). As predicted, the number of cells with two polarization sites increased from 2.3-13% and 23% with increasing duration of drug treatment and hence increasing level of Cdc42 activity (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Table S4). Next, we used Dbem2 cells to increase Cdc42 activity in the presence of Rdi1. We found that similar to a previous report 49 , 8.7% of cells formed two buds (Fig. 7e), and this was independent of the GFP tag, strain background or Cdc42 expression level ( Supplementary Fig. S5, Supplementary Table S4). We further increased Cdc42 activity by overexpressing Cdc24 ( Supplementary Fig. S5d) or expressing a Cdc42 mutant with high intrinsic GDP release rate (Cdc42 F28L (ref. 51)). Neither treatment induced formation of double buds in control cells (Fig. 7e, Supplementary S5c). However, in Dbem2 strains the number of cells forming multiple polarization sites increased significantly (Fig. 7e,  Supplementary S5c). Our results indicate that actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is prone to creating multiple polarization sites, and that this effect is sensitive to the level of Cdc42 activity.",

Although formation of two polarization sites in a small percentage of cells in a population might, at first sight, seem tolerable, even slight effects on cell division could translate into a strong evolutionary disadvantage. Indeed, we found that the formation of multiple buds directly correlated with an increased number of mis-segregated nuclei (Fig. 8a) and this effect was dependent on increased activity of Cdc42 (Fig. 8b). On average, more than 20% of cells with double buds also exhibited defects in nuclear segregation (Figs 8b,7e). Formation of multiple buds therefore likely has direct impact on cell survival.",

GDIdependent recycling of Cdc42 is fast and coupled to the GTPase cycle of Cdc42. Symmetry breaking in this pathway occurs via a combination of positive feedback loops for activation and recruitment of Cdc42, is characterized by efficient formation of a unique polarization axis, but is sensitive to perturbations in the GTPase cycle of Cdc42. In contrast, actin-mediated recycling of Cdc42 is slower and depends solely on Cdc42 activity 13 . The use of actin cables for delivery of Cdc42 to the plasma membrane leads to formation of very stable polarization sites. However, this stability comes with a significant risk of stochastically generating multiple stable polarization sites-an effect that becomes especially prominent if Cdc42 activity is increased. By combining the two recycling pathways, yeast cells ensure reliable establishment of a unique polarity axis.",

These findings contradict a recent study, in which stochastic polarization of Cdc42 was proposed to depend critically on low expression levels 30 . Instead, we find that polarization depends on the level of Cdc42 activity. Second, because of separate positive feedback in Cdc42 activation (Cdc42 GTP -GEF-Bem1-Cla4 interactions) and Cdc42 recruitment (GEF-GDI competition), our model does not depend on non-linear recruitment of the GEF, which was required for polarization in a previous model 28 and was not supported by our experiments.",

The latter effect is a result of a reduced recycling speed and hence smaller contribution for the GDI pathway ( Fig. 6c) and a simultaneous failure of the actin pathway to focus polarization to a single site if Cdc42 activity is increased (Fig. 7c). GDI recycling therefore needs to be faster than the actin pathway to ensure polarization at a single site and in our simulations Cdc42 in control cells seems to indeed hydrolyse GTP with nearly maximal possible speed. At the other extreme, if the GDI pathway is deleted, cells become very prone to form multiple caps (Fig. 7c).",

            "text": "Our proposed model was capable of reproducing all our experimental results and made several accurate and quantitative predictions. However, there are still many open questions concerning the biophysical and biochemical basis for cell polarization. For example, it has recently been demonstrated that lipid composition at the polarized site, in particular negatively charged phospholipids, influence the association of Cdc42 with the plasma membrane and hence impact on cell polarity 53,54 . Furthermore, although we assumed cell cycle-dependent activation of Cdc24 and inactivation of Bem2 in the LatB washout experiments (Fig. 7, Supplementary Fig. S5), the detailed biochemistry of these regulatory processes is not fully understood and they were not included in the mathematical model. Finally, we did not consider potential regulation of GDI-Cdc42 interaction or GDI-membrane interaction by phosphorylation 55 . All these additional aspects provide ample scope for future improvements in both modelling and mechanistic understanding of cell polarization. As nicely summarized in a recent review, the value of a mathematical model should be judged 'not by how complex and detailed it is, but by what could be learned from it' 47 . Our current model consequently incorporates the minimum degree of complexity compatible with generation of meaningful forecasts, and was able to reflect and predict basic properties of cellular organization that will hopefully help to rationalize a variety of different biological processes.",
