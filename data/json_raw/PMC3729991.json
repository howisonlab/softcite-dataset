In the retrocecal and retrocolic positions, attachments to the lateral peritoneum and cecum may lead to difficulties during SPICES, which is performed with only one port. Here, we present the effects of variations in the position of the vermiform appendix in treating acute appendicitis with SPICES. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 52 children who underwent SPICES for acute appendicitis between March 2010 and November 2011 in our institution. One group (group A) consisted of 30 patients (mean age, 10.5 \u00b1 2.5 years) with retrocecal appendix, while the other group (group B) included 22 patients (mean age, 10.9 \u00b1 2.3 years) with the appendix lying free in the peritoneal cavity. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of patient age, gender, success rate of SPICES, mean operating time, mean follow-up period, overall complication rates or mean postoperative hospitalization period. Conclusion: These results suggest that SPICES is a safe and feasible approach even in patients with retrocecal acute appendicitis."

            "text": "Since the first successful laparoscopic appendectomy (LA) was performed by Semm [1] in Germany for a noninflamed appendix during gynecological surgery, numerous modifications of the procedure have been described for reducing pain and improving cosmetic results. The modifications have especially focused on reducing the number of ports [2][3][4]. As the need to minimize patient scars and maximize patient safety has increased, new devices such as the all-in-one laparoscope have continued to improve. These modifications and devices have led surgeons to use single port incisionless-intracorporeal conventional equipment-endoscopic surgery (SPICES) frequently [5]. This technique requires only an 11-mm conventional port, an all-in-one laparoscope and conventional working instruments. SPICES was first successfully used in appendectomy by Akgur et al. [5] in Turkey in 2010.",

We used the 0 degree all-inone laparoscope including a 6-mm operating channel and a parallel eyepiece (KARL STORZ GmbH & Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany) in all cases. Initial diagnostic laparoscopy was routinely undertaken. Afterwards, the appendix was dissected from the retroperitoneal bands and grasped with a 5-mm atraumatic long grasper. A 16 G angiocath was percutaneously inserted in the peritoneal cavity. The needle was withdrawn, and a SWING suture, described by Akgur et al. [5], was passed through the sheath of the angiocath. The appendix was slung using this suture. The meso-appendix was dissected using ultrasonic shears (Harmonic Scalpel, Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). The appendiceal base was then ligated intracorporeally with a 2-0 polyglactin suture using a fisherman's knot formed extracorporeally. The appendix was transected and the abdominal cavity was washed. Following the release of the SWING suture, the appendix was removed inside the port to minimize the chance of wound contamination.",

It reduces the irritation of the intestine and the incidence of postoperative adhesions. LA also allows the surgeon to assess associated abnormalities within the abdominal cavity. As laparoscopic mini mal invasive surgery has drawn greater attention and new equipment is developed, SILS has been increasingly widely used in appendectomy [11,12]. Performing SILS through the umbilicus, a congenital scar provides reliable cos metic results. Only one incision is made; thus, the risk of complications such as port site hernia, hematoma and infection are reduced. In the past decade, a number of SILS modifications for appendectomy have been described: 1) Extracorporeal laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy through a single umbilical port site is difficult to perform, causes wound contamination and usually requires a second port, 2) SILS with R-port or Triport requires a 2-cm incision that is larger than children's umbilical margins, and 3) SPICES is a feasible approach with excellent cosmetic results in children [5,13].",

It replaces the second port and is capable of repositioning the appendix, like conventional graspers.

Therefore, in 2 cases in group A, we were not able to sling the appendix because of the truly extraperitoneal position, and open appendectomy was performed. The overall conversion rate to multitrocar surgery was also 3.8% in the present study. In one case in each group, the omentum covered the appendix firmly, and the second port was inserted."

These results may encourage surgeons to perform the appendectomy with one port, but it is important not to be reluctant to insert a second or even a third port, especially in cases with truly extraperitoneal appendix and severe adhesions.

            "text": "The mean operating time was longer in the group with retrocecal appendix, but this difference was not statistically sig nificant. This may be because more time was spent on the dissection of peritoneal adhesions in group A. Additionally, one case of postoperative adhesion-related intestinal obstruction may be the result of extended dissection in group A. SILS with R-port or Triport requires at least a 2-cm incision, which is larger than the umbilical area, especially in children, and thus may result in a scar. In contrast, only a 1-cm incision is performed in SPICES. We suggest that care should be taken to keep the incision within the umbilical ring for the best cosmetic outcome."

The diagnosis of left-sided acute appendicitis may be difficult, and it is made based on physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and computed tomo graphy. In addition to being useful for appendectomy, laparoscopy can be diagnostic in patients with confusing cases [17]. In 2 cases, the malpositioned appendix lay free in the peritoneal cavity, and we performed SPICES without extended dissection. Approximately 100 cases of left-sided acute appendicitis have been reported in the literature [18]. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of left-sided acute appendicitis performed with SPICES.",
