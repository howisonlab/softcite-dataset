            "text": "Demographic aging of the world population contributes to an increase in the number of persons diagnosed with dementia (PWD), with corresponding increases in health care expenditures. In addition, fewer family members are available to care for these individuals. Most care for PWD occurs in the home, and family members caring for PWD frequently suffer negative outcomes related to the stress and burden of observing their loved one's progressive memory and functional decline. Decreases in cognition and self-care also necessitate that the caregiver takes on new roles and responsibilities in care provision. Smart technologies are being developed to support family caregivers of PWD in a variety of ways, including provision of information and support resources online, wayfinding technology to support independent mobility of the PWD, monitoring systems to alert caregivers to changes in the PWD and their environment, navigation devices to track PWD experiencing wandering, and telemedicine and e-health services linking caregivers and PWD with health care providers. This paper will review current uses of these advancing technologies to support care of PWD. Challenges unique to widespread acceptance of technology will be addressed and future directions explored.",

            "text": "Cognitive impairment, including memory loss and related neurodegenerative diseases, is placing increasing demands on US health care and family systems. In 2014, the medical cost of caring for PWD is estimated at $214 billion; the expected medical cost in 2050 is projected to be $1.2 trillion. 6 The annual overall Medicare and Medicaid expenditure for dementia care is $150 billion for acute, long-term, and hospice care. 6 Uncompensated contributions of family caregivers were estimated at $202.6 billion in 2010 considering an hourly wage of $11.93 per hour. 6,7 PWD have more than triple the number of hospitalizations and nursing home admissions compared with older adults with other conditions. AD and other types of dementia are the sixth leading cause of death. 6 Family caregivers experience high levels of stress, burden, and role captivity that lead to negative physical, psychological, social, and spiritual outcomes. [14][15][16] Caregivers of PWD must cope with their loved one's progressive memory loss, self-care impairment, and communication breakdown. Additional caregiver challenges include learning new skills to manage disruptive behaviors; altered manifestations of behavioral and psychological symptoms that are common, progressive, and change in dementia; and complex conditions such as delirium that require guidance from health care professionals. [17][18][19] Caregiving stress, strain, and burden contribute to negative physical and mental health outcomes that include depression, insomnia, and psychotropic medication use, with notable increases in caregiver morbidity and mortality. 20,21 Different types of caregivers face unique challenges. Spousal caregivers may experience grieving due to changes in their relationship with their life partner. They may struggle to physically manage care or suffer cognitive changes themselves. Children and younger spousal caregivers may have occupational stress and career changes and may still be caring for their children while balancing care for parents or a spouse with AD. Caregivers separated by distance face unique challenges as they manage caregiving from afar. They may worry about their family member's safety and security, medication schedules, wandering, and need for information and socialization. The distant caregiver may be totally unaware of the needs of their family member, placing further burden on the onsite caregiver(s). 6 ",

Over 50% of those aged over 65 years use computers and related devices daily to access the internet to seek medical information and social support. 22 Surveys of family caregivers report that 80%-95% request mobile systems and find that interactive features assist in caregiving. Two-thirds of family caregivers in the US have a mobile wireless device, and 69% of these report that it assists them in caregiving. Mobile technology features such as mobile text messaging, personal medical recording, and visual communication with health care providers meet specific user needs. [22][23][24] Telemedicine and e-health services are now available to support care for older adults and family caregivers. Virtual care in the community delivered via technology-based approaches is able to overcome the limitations of face-to-face delivery; namely, time constraints, geographic limitations, and transportation issues. 25 For those dealing with early-stage AD, key considerations are 1) identifying the needs of cognitively impaired adults and their family caregivers, 2) developing technological applications suitable for constrained environments and user abilities, 3) establishing training strategies for cognitively impaired adults to use the technologies, and 4) providing appropriate technical support for cognitively impaired adults and caregivers. 26 ",

Two separate systematic reviews highlight the benefits of web-based caregiver support programs. 29 Web-based training and educational programs to support caregivers are readily available. The Internet-Based Savvy Caregiver, based on the validated Savvy Caregiver program, 30 is an example. It provides an interactive, iterative curriculum that improves knowledge about, and competence for, caregiving. 25 A customized computer-telephone integration system, e-care, provides a psychoeducational intervention that identifies resources and strategies to enhance safety, communication, selfcare, social support, and management of problem behaviors in the community. 31 The system features screen phones with hierarchal menus (text and voice) that enables users to 1) place and receive calls, 2) send and retrieve messages, 3) access a range of information and services, and 4) conference with several people simultaneously. This system was effective in decreasing caregiver burden and depression significantly in depression scores in caregivers with high depression scores at baseline. 31 Another type of in-home caregiver support links caregivers with expert guidance for managing challenging care situations using video monitoring. Caregivers are trained to capture behaviors that are a problem via computer video recording, which is then wirelessly uploaded for a team of experts to review and provide feedback. In a pilot study, this system demonstrated improved behavior management and caregiver communication and was reported as easy to use. 32 Support for caregivers can also be provided via web-based video conferencing and/or text-based chat forums. 33 There is growing use and acceptance of video conferencing in both the diagnosis and monitoring in geriatric medical 34 and geriatric psychiatry care. [35][36][37] Though further large-scale studies are needed, research has established the reliability and validity for neurocognitive testing and neurological examinations via video telemedicine. 35,37,38 Video conferencing can also link local primary care professionals to specialists for assessments, enhancing the administration of standardized assessments and examinations. 35,36 Telehealth diagnosis and monitoring have been welcomed in remote and rural areas and with Spanishspeaking and Native American populations, as access to specialized services is limited in these underserved areas. 39,40 ",

            "text": "It is widely recognized that caregiving is burdensome and leads to excessive levels of stress; thus, technology must be adapted to address the causes of caregiver stressors. For example, caregivers are concerned about the safety and security of their PWD. It is stressful if the caregiver needs to leave the PWD at home alone for any length of time or while they work, due to possible wandering, accidents, or other negative events that may harm the PWD. Technology that monitors whether or not the PWD leaves the home, falls, or enacts other behaviors and potentially dangerous environmental conditions (eg, heat, water on the floor, fire) may alleviate some of these concerns. Many new systems provide these types of monitoring and tracking systems. Three main aims of monitoring are detection of activities of daily living (ADLs), occurrence of significant events (ie, falls), and changes in health status, or a combination of these. 41 Monitoring systems are designed to detect changes in one or more ADLs or physical parameters. Detection of subtle changes can trigger interventions to avert negative outcomes such as hospitalizations. In a systematic review, Peetoom et al 41 categorized existing monitoring technologies into five categories: 1) in-home passive infrared motion sensors, 2) body-worn sensors, 3) video monitoring, 4) pressure sensors, and 5) sound recognition integrated with multicomponent systems and \"smart homes\". An example of simple monitoring is a motion detector that turns on a bathroom light or a wireless home security system that is triggered by exiting or entering, activating an alarm. This technology gathers information through activity sequence awareness, location awareness, presence awareness, and context awareness capabilities. 42 Initially, data are captured to identify patterns for the individual over time. Systems are developed to code behavior using computer-derived algorithms to identify patterns that deviate from normal and trigger warnings. 43 Requisite to this system is a person capable of receiving and responding to the alarm to alleviate or intervene on the alarm upon notification.",

Changes in ADLs and instrumental ADL performance provide objective data about disease progression. 44 Through sensor technology, health care providers are able to detect cognitive decline reflected in behaviors such as getting out of bed at odd hours or going to bed earlier and earlier from day to day. 44 Yefimova and Woods 45 also describe use of sensor technologies 1) to identify patterns of baseline norms of activities through multimodal awareness monitoring and then 2) to detect the onset or escalation of disruptive behaviors. Repetitive motions might be \"normal\" in the bathroom when one is brushing teeth, though might indicate increased agitation if it occurs when sitting down. 45 A commercially available example is the QuietCare system, which monitors ADLs. 43 The QuietCare system requires a response to the alarms, activated through emails to caregivers, and in urgent situations to a 24/7 regional emergency center. In a Dutch study on psychogeriatric patients living at home alone, there was a significant decrease in burden for formal or informal caregivers at a distance. 43 ",

If the stove has been left on for too long, data points indicating the temperature are detected, compared, and then analyzed in order to generate an alert for distance caregivers. 47 At Tiger Place, an assisted living facility in Columbia, MI, USA, an aging in place initiative uses this type of complex monitoring system. A wide variety of data are collected using 1) infrared sensors detecting motion on kitchen cabinets while preparing meals and 2) bed pneumatic sensors assessing levels of pulse, respiration, and restlessness. 48 Algorithms are developed to analyze these data to identify functional decline and potential illnesses. Then, health care providers such as nurse practitioners provide timely and effective care to improve and maintain health and functional independence. 48 While this system is scientifically verified, it is not used in home settings yet because it requires expensive advanced technologies and intensive training for health care providers.",

A pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a GPS device with expanded features for 1) tracking location and tracing path through satellite, 2) programming telephone connection between the PWD and the family caregivers, and 3) activating a loudspeaker function to communicate with the PWD in case they cannot use the phone. 54 This study of dyads (N=33) found that the GPS intervention increases the ability of PWD to go outside independently, results in more freedom of PWD away from caregivers, and decreases levels of stress of both PWD and caregivers. 54 Another example using complex tracking programs is prevention of nighttime falls in PWD. This tracking program, HBTec-TS system, incorporates a nightlight path device that is installed near the bed and is triggered to light up automatically when the person steps out of bed. The lighting guides the PWD to the bathroom at night. In addition, this system can be integrated with a wrist band similar to LifeLine \u00ae , a remote intercom, and a connection to a hotline for emergency personnel. 55 A recent study using the HBTec-TS system reported a significant decrease in nighttime falls in the intervention group (N=49) compared with the control group (N=47) of community-dwelling PWD (odds ratio =0.37, 95% confidence interval =0.15-0.88, P=0.02). This system reduced the relative risk of falls by 48.8% in PWD at high risk for frequent falls. 55 ",

However, these tracking devices are not helpful for every PWD and may lead to diminished privacy and dependency. 56 In general, technology that allows people to remain more independent and reside at home safely is rated positively. 54,57,58 Span et al 59 found that involving the PWD in the process of developing technological applications enhanced usability and acceptability and contributed to a sense of empowerment.",

Restrictions and automations are intended to support independent living; however, unnecessary and too frequent use of technologies easily diminishes independence of choice and action of the PWD living in their home. Instead of being helpful, extremely advanced technology beyond the user's capacity can become frustrating and dehumanizing to the PWD. 58,60 Significant time must be spent on educating and ensuring understanding of each type of technological device that will be used in the home. 58 There may also be stigma associated with the technology. Families may be apprehensive about the presence of technology in the home, with the belief that such devices are used only for dependent and frail older adults. 60 There are concerns that technology that is obtrusive and visible may cause potential embarrassment and anxiety. Devices should be designed to minimize attracting attention; for example, using a smartphone for a technological application is discreet and can help avoid stigmatization. 46 In addition, alarms should not be too loud. Features should be designed to alert the caregiver but prevent agitation and avoid frightening the PWD. 61 A critical factor in acceptance of technology is ease of use. 62 This is especially pertinent for PWD whose caregivers are themselves aging and may have limited experience and different attitudes toward technology. Spousal caregivers may also be of advanced age with corresponding physical and cognitive changes such as reduced processing speed, less manual dexterity, and low visual acuity. There is a risk that older adults may feel frustrated if they frequently fail in using devices, and they may find technology use as another burdensome caregiving task.",

A hands-on approach (experiential learning style) is essential to developing competency in technology use by older adults. PWD and their caregivers should be involved in developing and testing these technologies. 64 Ongoing tech support and resources for troubleshooting that are readily accessible will also be needed.",

The leading factor driving acceptance and use of technology is perceived value (usefulness) or meeting a need. 62 Marketing available technologies to make consumers aware of these supports will play a crucial role. 64 In addition, access to internet infrastructure is critical to use of technology to support dementia care in the home. The Federal Communication Commission developed a National Broadband Plan in 2010 and identified how high-speed internet access is essential for older adults for next-generation internet technologies that include telehealth and smart homes, supporting needs of older adults, including personal fulfillment, health preservation, social connectedness, caregiver support, and functional capability and activity. 63 Ethical principles should be applied to protect PWD users from potential negative aspects of technology. Mahoney et al 65 developed a list of ethical principles for gerotechnology research and development targeting persons with AD and their caregivers. Their guidelines state how to maintain respect, autonomy, beneficence, justice and distributional fairness, nonabandonment, and privacy and confidentiality. 65 Stringent regulation should be applied for data collection, de-identification, data storage, distribution of study findings, as well as secondary data use.

Finally, the potential for technology to support dementia care at home may reduce health care expenditures secondary to formal care needs and premature institutional care. However, realizing the potential for technology to meet dementia care needs depends on a number of factors, including raising awareness of available technologies and their utility, promoting accessibility and affordability, and overcoming challenges to acceptance and use. Future research and continuous development are required to use advanced technology integrated with current dementia care.",
