Design: A prospective, randomised, open-controlled trial with blinded end-point analysis. Setting: A single-centre London teaching hospital. Participants: Twenty-five patients with HFpEF who were recruited into the RDT-PEF trial. Main outcome measures: Macro-vascular: 24-h ambulatory pulse pressure, aorta distensibilty (from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), aorta pulse wave velocity (CMR), augmentation index (peripheral tonometry) and renal artery blood flow indices (renal MR). Micro-vascular: endothelial function (peripheral tonometry) and urine microalbuminuria. Results: At baseline, 15 patients were normotensive, 9 were hypertensive and 1 was hypotensive. RDT did not lower any of the blood pressure indices. Though there was evidence of abnormal vascular function at rest, RDT did not affect these at 3 or 12 months follow-up. Conclusions: RDT did not improve markers of macro-and micro-vascular function."

            "text": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a prevalent phenotype of heart failure for which no treatment has, as yet, been shown to improve prognosis. 1 Its underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial. Abnormal micro-and macro-vascular function have been observed in HFpEF and their presence is associated with increased cardiovascular events 2 as well as exercise intolerance. 2,3 The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is a modulator of arterial function. 4 Renal denervation (RDT) is a novel technique that has been shown to reduce central sympathetic outflow and hence may promote vascular remodelling. 5 The Renal DenervaTion in heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (RDT-PEF) was conducted to investigate the effect of RDT upon symptoms, exercise function, left ventricular filling and cardiac remodelling in patients with HFpEF. 6 A vascular function substudy involving the same participants of the parent trial was prospectively designed to test the hypothesis that the vasculature might be a therapeutic target in HFpEF.",

Therapies investigated to date include angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, 23 alagebrium, 24 sildenafil 25 and exercise training. 26 The RDT-PEF trial joins this long list of neutral trials, Table 3.

A common theme in the discussions following all of these trials is that patients with HFpEF are heterogeneous and that future trials should target therapies according to the underlying dominant pathophysiology, e.g. a trial of a new therapy that improves vascular function should recruit HFpEF patients who all have proven abnormal vascular responsiveness, which historically has not been done.",

The difficulty with this is that each combination has varying repeatability and furthermore provides a different insight into the macro-and micro-vasculature function that is not comparable. The American Heart Association have recently published a guidance document on how to assess arterial stiffness in research and discuss the lack of a widely adopted and rigorous method of vascular function investigation. 27 They promote the carotid-femoral PWV technique for non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness. Though this is valuable guidance, it is sobering to note that using data from the RDT-PEF cohort, approximately 536 patients would need to be recruited for an intervention to detect a 15% change in PWV (80% power, P \u00bc 0.05, standard deviation \u00bc 6.2 m/s), which for many research units seeking to investigate a HFpEF population might be prohibitive. It is possible that arterial stiffness is not an ideal endpoint to use in an HFpEF clinical trial. The majority of the evidence showing that an intervention can improve arterial stiffness has been in the context of hypertension trials; it is unknown whether the aorta can be 'unstiffened' independent of a blood pressure reduction. 27 Also, patients recruited into HFpEF trials tend to be older than those in hypertension trials and consequently reversal of aorta stiffening with an intervention may take longer to manifest (requiring prolonged trial follow-up) or may be impossible reflecting an irreversible stage of the disease process.",

In nine pigs, Tsioufis and colleagues showed that RDT both acutely and chronically after a month increased renal blood flow and reduced resistive index, assessed by an invasive Doppler wire. We were not able to reproduce this finding in 25 humans using spiral renal MR. Similarly in resistant hypertension, improvements in renal perfusion and oxygenation as assessed by MR have not been demonstrated following RDT, 5 though one group showed a decrease in resistive index (derived from ultrasound). 7 These neutral findings might just reflect the fact that the kidneys are well auto-regulated via multiple regulatory mechanisms, which are not all dependent on the SNS.

Several controversies remain that need to be addressed before the future role if any of RDT can be ascertained: first, with the technology (multi-electrode vs. single-electrode systems) and how best to apply it (number and location of ablations in the renal artery). When this study was conceived, the Symplicity TM single-electrode device was the only system with supporting efficacy and safety data, which is why it was used. Over the subsequent years, it has become apparent that multi-electrode systems are more likely to achieve a comprehensive denervation. 8 Furthermore, it is likely that the initial technique, which limited four to six ablations in the proximal renal artery prior to any bifurcations may have been too conservative with current data supporting more ablations that also extend to distal branch vessels. 29 Consequently, it remains unknown what the efficacy or safety of contemporary RDT on patients with heart failure are. 30 Finally, until an approach to accurately quantify the effects of RDT on renal sympathetic nerves is developed, it will remain difficult for future phase II studies to show a 'dose-response' effect, which will limit the credibility of any findings. 6 ",

The intervention did not improve markers of vascular dysfunction, though with the limited numbers, in this study, it was underpowered to do so. It remains unknown whether pulse wave velocity is a modifiable risk marker in HFpEF."
