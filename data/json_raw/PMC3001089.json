RNR is also essential for maintenance of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mammals. The mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number in mammals are only being discovered. In budding yeast, RNR overexpression resulted in increased mtDNA levels, and rescued the disease phenotypes caused by a mutant mtDNA polymerase. This raised the question of whether mtDNA copy number increase by RNR induction could be a strategy for treating diseases with mtDNA mutations. We show here that highlevel overexpression of RNR subunits (Rrm1, Rrm2 and p53R2; separately or in different combinations) in mice does not result in mtDNA copy number elevation. Instead, simultaneous expression of two RNR subunits leads to imbalanced dNTP pools and progressive mtDNA depletion in the skeletal muscle, without mtDNA mutagenesis. We also show that endogenous RNR transcripts are downregulated in response to large increases of mtDNA in mice, which is indicative of nuclear-mitochondrial crosstalk with regard to mtDNA copy number. Our results establish that RNR is not limiting for mtDNA copy number in mice, and provide new evidence for the importance of balanced dNTP pools in mtDNA maintenance in postmitotic tissues.",

The enzyme is known to contribute to malignant transformation (2,3). During S-phase, RNR is abundant as a tetramer composed of homodimers of the large Rrm1 and small Rrm2 subunits. In non-cycling cells, Rrm2 is replaced by the alternative small subunit p53R2 (4). The latter is induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and was initially considered to contribute to nuclear DNA damage responses (5,6).",

Inactivating mutations of RRM2B, the gene encoding p53R2, were not associated with neoplasms, but caused early onset fatal depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (MIM #612075) (7). Similarly, knock-out mice lacking p53R2 exhibited near-total loss of mtDNA and died shortly after weaning (7,8). We recently reported that a dominant RRM2B mutation led to truncated p53R2 and caused adult-onset progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with multiple mtDNA deletions (9). Certain compound heterozygote RRM2B mutations have also been shown to result in mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE; MIM #603041) (10). Defects in p53R2 can therefore cause diseases of differing severity, ranging from fatal multisystem disorders with mtDNA depletion in children, to an adult-onset muscle disorder with multiple mtDNA deletions. These results highlight the essential role of RNR in mtDNA maintenance in postmitotic cells.",

This suggested that RNR levels, by affecting dNTP pools, might be rate limiting for mtDNA synthesis, and that increasing the availability of the enzyme might be a tool for increasing mtDNA abundance.

Briefly, the mice were maintained on a pure FVB/N strain background and expressed their transgene under the control of chicken b-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus enhancer regulatory sequences. The transgenic mice seemed grossly normal and were fertile. The presence of the transgene was verified by PCR analysis as described earlier (3). Rrm1 Tg mice showed restricted overexpression of Rrm1 protein primarily in the skeletal muscle by immunoblotting whereas Rrm2 Tg and p53R2 Tg mice had widespread, high-level overexpression of the transgene in all tested tissues. For this study, we created mice overexpressing Rrm1 together with either Rrm2 or p53R2 by cross-breeding mice that were hemizygous for each transgene. Because the PCR assay used to detect Rrm1 Tg and p53R2 Tg is not transgene-specific (3), the presence of Rrm1 Tg or p53R2 Tg in offspring from these crosses was determined by Southern blotting. Briefly, tail DNA obtained from offspring was digested overnight with BamHI (Rrm1 Tg ) or EcoRV (p53R2 Tg ). After DNA was immobilized on a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus, Perkin Elmer), transgene bands were detected by hybridization with radio-labeled probes derived from previously described pCaggs RNR expression constructs (3).

Briefly, skeletal muscle was excised following euthanasia by CO 2 asphyxiation and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. When sufficient tissue was available, samples were divided into two equal portions, processed separately, and compared to assess measurement consistency. Tissues were weighed and immersed in $5 ml/mg 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mM MgCl 2 . Tissues were homogenized in a Qiagen Tissue Lyser by six cycles of 30 s at 30 Hz followed by 30 s on ice. Tissue homogenates were incubated on ice for 20 min, then spun at 13 000 g for 1 min. The supernatant was taken to a fresh tube and re-spun. An approximately equal volume of 0.5N trioctylamine in fluorotrichloromethane was added to the supernatant. The samples were vortexed briefly and spun for 2 min at 16 000 g. The volume of the upper phase was estimated by pipetting and aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u00c080 C until nucleotide measurements were performed. dNTPs were measured using an indirect enzymatic assay as reported by Ferraro et al. (24). Standard curves were prepared from concentrated stocks of pure individual dNTPs (Fermentas). Reactions in 50 ml total volume were incubated for 1 h and then 30 ml was spotted to Whatman DE81 paper discs and dried. Discs were washed three times in 5% Na 2 HPO 4 , and once each in dH 2 O and 95% EtOH. Discs were dried and counted on a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Measurement of ribonucleosides was performed as in Kochanowski et al. (25) with modifications. Analyses were carried out on a Shimadzu UHPLC system. Samples were separated on a Supelco LC-18T column in 30 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate, pH 6.5: methanol (A = 91.7:8.3, B = 71.6:28.4) over a 40-min time period.

Since active RNR requires the presence of the large and the small subunit, simultaneous overexpression of both subunits could cause a greater increase in RNR activity. We therefore interbred Rrm1 Tg mice with Rrm2 Tg or p53R2 Tg mice to generate bitransgenic mice. The Rrm1 Tg +Rrm2 Tg and Rrm1 Tg +p53R2 Tg mice were born at expected frequencies and showed no gross abnormalities (Supplementary Table S1). The endogenous RNR subunits were barely or not at all detectable by western blotting of 25 mg protein for each muscle tissue extract, whereas significant overexpression was observed in RNR Tg samples. We therefore made serial dilutions from each RNR Tg sample, and plotted the band intensities against the dilution level. Fitting the corresponding wild-type samples onto this plot allowed us to estimate the fold overexpression for each transgene-encoded protein (Figure 1). The calculated threshold dilutions for bitransgenic mice are shown in Table 1. The level of transgene overexpression was comparable between single RNR transgenic and bitransgenic mice (Supplementary Figure S1).",

In mice, overexpression of the histone-like packaging protein TFAM or of the mtDNA helicase Twinkle increase mtDNA copy number 2-to 3-fold (14,15). The mRNA level of Twinkle and the protein level of TFAM correlate linearly with mtDNA content, suggesting that these may be limiting factors in determining the amount of mtDNA. Defects in mitochondrial dNTP pool maintenance proteins cause loss of mtDNA, indicating that these factors are essential for mtDNA maintenance (7,(33)(34)(35)(36). However, their contribution to the physiological control of mtDNA copy number is not well characterized. Heart-specific overexpression of the salvage pathway enzyme thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) in mice resulted in a 300-fold increase in enzyme activity and produced a $30% increase in mtDNA copy number (37). Therefore, a very large increase in TK2 activity modestly influences mtDNA levels, potentially through increases in deoxycytidine and thymidine nucleotide pools. Our results show that although RNR is involved in the synthesis of all four dNTPs, very high levels of the enzyme do not increase mtDNA copy number and instead perturb mtDNA homeostasis. This finding is in line with Twinkle and TFAM being the main regulators of mtDNA level under normal circumstances.",

In yeast, the first established signaling pathway that regulated mtDNA copy number is activated by the Mec1p/Rad53p kinases and leads to induction of RNR expression (12). The related ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase in humans was also found to influence RNR expression and mtDNA homeostasis (38). We found the transcription of Rrm1 and Rrm2b to be downregulated in two independent mouse models with increased mtDNA copy number, suggesting an intimate feedback mechanism between transcriptional regulation of RNR subunits and mtDNA levels. RNR could thus contribute to a regulatory mechanism for nuclear control of mtDNA copy number in vivo. Such a signaling pathway could involve p53, a tumor suppressor and ATM target, which influences the expression level of p53R2 and is known to localize in small amounts to mitochondria (39).",

Rrm2 induced higher dNTP increases than p53R2, which is consistent with Rrm2 being more active than p53R2 in vitro (41). Rrm1 overexpression alone was able to induce a detectable, albeit not statistically significant, increase in dATP and dCTP levels, and overexpression of Rrm1 together with either small subunit led to a clear trend towards higher levels of dATP and dCTP. This apparent synergy suggested that co-overexpression of both subunits led to an increase in the abundance of the tetramer, with subsequent effects on nucleotide pools.",

However, we found remarkable dNTP pool imbalances in the RNR Tg mice. The dGTP pools were unchanged whereas dTTP pools were actually decreased in p53R2 Tg as well as Rrm1 Tg +p53R2 Tg mice. This finding illustrates the need for tight control of the relative activities of the large number of anabolic and catabolic enzymes that determine the final dNTP composition in vivo (42). For instance, the synthesis of thymidine phosphates requires-as an additional step-reductive methylation of RNR-generated deoxyuridine monophosphate, which is catalyzed by thymidylate synthase. Hence, induction of RNR could cause a substrate overload for the endogenous thymidylate synthase, which in turn could explain why increased RNR does not increase the dTTP level. Furthermore, the specificity of RNR for GDP reduction is induced by the binding of dTTP to the specificity site of Rrm1 (1). Thus, a relative lack of dTTP could explain why the dGTP pools did not increase in our mice. The dNTP imbalance was not due to depletion of any of the substrates of RNR, since the levels of ADP, CDP, UDP and GDP were similar in all genotypes.",

Given the presence of altered dNTP pools in RNR Tg mice, the likely mechanism of progressive mtDNA depletion in bitransgenic mice is inefficient mtDNA replication caused by perturbed dNTP balance. Initiation of nuclear DNA replication is influenced by the dNTP pool (44,45), and an imbalanced pool could lead to reduced frequency of mtDNA replication initiation. mtDNA depletion was specifically restricted to bitransgenic mice, which was consistent with them displaying the largest dNTP alterations. The fact that Rrm2 Tg and p53R2 Tg mice also had altered dNTP pools but no mtDNA depletion, suggests a threshold effect for the relative dNTP levels above which mtDNA replication becomes inefficient. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that co-overexpression of Rrm1 and the small subunit gave rise to additional, unidentified effects, which did not occur upon overexpression of one subunit. Moreover, mtDNA depletion was observed only in the skeletal muscle, although the transgenes were overexpressed in both the skeletal and cardiac muscles, suggesting tissue specific mechanisms in the regulation of nucleotide pools and/or mtDNA maintenance.",

Contrary to MNGIE, however, we found no increase in mtDNA point mutations or deletions in the RNR Tg mice. There are at least two possible explanations for the absence of mtDNA instability, other than depletion, in our mice. First, the dNTP changes were almost opposite to those in MNGIE, i.e. the relative dTTP level decreased instead of increasing. Further studies are needed to elucidate the exact effect of changes in the relative levels of each of the four dNTPs on mtDNA replication frequency and fidelity. Second, the life-span of a mouse may be too short to develop significant amounts of mtDNA deletions or point mutations in the setting of dNTP imbalance. In support of this, the MNGIE mouse model lacking TP and the related uridine phosphorylase (UP) displayed increased dTTP in brain, and, similar to RNR Tg mice, developed progressive mtDNA depletion, but no deletions or point mutations (27). The authors argued that this was at least partly due to the short life-span of mice, emphasizing the differences in dNTP maintenance and disorders between species.",
