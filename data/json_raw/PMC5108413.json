            "text": "Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of signs of gastrointestinal disease in cats. A subset of cats with IBD has neutrophilic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Hypothesis: Neutrophilic enteritis in cats is associated with mucosal invasion by microorganisms, and specifically Campylobacter spp. Animals: Seven cats with neutrophilic IBD and 8 cats with lymphoplasmacytic IBD. Methods: Retrospective review of duodenal biopsy specimens that were collected endoscopically for histologic examination. Cases were identified and selected by searching the histopathology archive for cats with a diagnosis of neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic IBD. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting either all eubacteria or individual Campylobacter spp. was performed on archived samples. Neutrophils were detected on the same samples using a FISH probe for neutrophil elastase. Results: Campylobacter coli was present in (6/7) cats with neutrophilic IBD and in (1/8) cats with lymphoplasmacytic IBD (P = .009). Cats with neutrophilic IBD had significantly higher number of C. coli (median bacteria 0.7/hpf) in the mucosa than cats with lymphoplasmacytic IBD (median bacteria 0/hpf) (P = 0.002). Colocalization of neutrophils and C. coli was demonstrated, with C. coli closer to the neutrophils than any other bacteria (P < .001). Conclusions and clinical importance: Identification of C. coli associated with neutrophilic inflammation suggests that C. coli is able either to produce compounds which stimulate neutrophils or to induce feline intestinal cells to produce neutrophil chemoattractants. This association should allow a directed therapeutic approach in cats with neutrophilic IBD, potentially improving outcome and reducing any zoonotic risk."

            "text": "I nflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common cause of chronic signs in cats with gastrointestinal disease. 1 Intestinal biopsies are needed to confirm intestinal inflammation, but cases are deemed idiopathic if no underlying cause is found. [1][2][3] Typically, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is found in biopsy specimens, but a subset of cats with IBD has neutrophilic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. The clinical relevance of neutrophilic infiltration is unclear. It might be secondary to bacterial infection, but neutrophilic colitis is seen with Tritrichomonas foetus infection 4 and a case of suppurative colitis in a cat was described 5 , where no bacterial infection could be identified. Mucosal friability and erosions might also induce neutrophilic infiltrates because of the loss of mucosal barrier integrity. If no etiological agent is identified, directed or appropriate treatment is unclear and empirical antibacterial treatment might be prescribed.",

Morphologic features of mucosal inflammation (villus stunting, epithelial injury, crypt dilatation/distortion, lacteal dilatation, and mucosal fibrosis) were also evaluated. Changes in morphological features were noted, but there was no appreciable difference between groups, with a range of nonemoderate within each group. The final diagnosis was categorized as 1 of 8 different histopathologic diagnoses: no abnormalities detected (NAD), lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory, eosinophilic inflammatory, neutrophilic inflammatory, lymphangiectasia, lymphoma, mucosal atrophy/fibrosis (noninflammatory) and other. Only samples from cats with lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory histopathologic changes and neutrophilic inflammatory histopathologic changes were included in the study.",

Steps one and two were general probes for Eubacteria and Firmicutes using three different probes for each bacterial group. A mixture of probes with slight base variations were used to maximize the spectrum of coverage of each probe mix. The third step used specific probes for Campylobacter species. These were used in combination with one probe labeling C. upsaliensis, another probe for C. jejuni, and a final probe labeling all thermophilic Campylobacter spp. Bacteria labeled solely by this last probe could either be C. lari or C. coli and were speciated by subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Cases with histopathologic changes consistent with neutrophilic inflammation may result from mucosal invasion by microorganisms, develop secondary to mucosal defects, or Tritrichomonas foetus infection or be idiopathic. The aims of this study were to use FISH to elucidate the presence of mucosal bacterial invasion in feline IBD, and to identify any association between Campylobacter invasion and neutrophilic inflammation (Picture 1)."

There was no clear pattern to their localization (mucosa/submucosa/ lamina propria) within the tissue. The total numbers of bacteria did not differ between groups and for two bacterial species (C. jejuni and C. upsaliensis) there was also no difference in distribution between the two groups. A significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the presence of C. coli. This in itself is simply an observation and merely demonstrates an increased presence of C. coli in cats with neutrophilic inflammation. However, FISH neutrophil elastase probes demonstrated close proximity to neutrophils and confirmed the possible association with C. coli. No association between neutrophil location and other species of bacteria was demonstrated. This association supports the hypothesis that C. coli is particularly associated with a specific neutrophilic form of inflammation in the duodenal mucosa of cats with enteric disease compared with other microorganisms."

Previous in vitro studies with porcine and human epithelial cells have shown that C. jejuni and C. coli induce neutrophilic intestinal inflammation via activation of NF-jB and subsequent production of the neutrophil chemokine IL-8 and also induce migration of neutrophils across the epithelium via the production of chemotactic n-formyl peptides in concert with metabolites of 12-LOX. 18,19 In the present retrospective study there was evidence that C. coli, but not C. jejuni, appears to colocalize with neutrophils and therefore might be acting as the etiological agent in this particular subset of feline inflammatory bowel disease, although other cell types and mechanisms could be involved. In vitro studies using feline neutrophils similarly to previous work on porcine neutrophils 18,19 would be necessary to determine a mechanism for chemoattraction.",

The lack of clinical data means we are unable to determine if any of the cats received antibiotic treatment before endoscopic biopsy collection. This is a potential confounding effect but prior antibiotic treatment would be expected to reduce bacterial numbers and the likelihood of finding a significant difference between the groups, except in the unlikely event that all the cats with lymphoplasmacytic IBD were treated with antibiotics and none of the cats with neutrophilic IBD were. Fecal analysis from each cat might also have been useful to determine whether Campylobacter spp. had been identified on culture. A prospective study based on the findings of this work would be necessary to evaluate clinical and treatment factors."

A previous study 20 showed that in dogs with enteropathy that there was poor agreement between histopathologic findings in ileal and duodenal biopsy specimens. Another study 21 also showed poor agreement on diagnosis between duodenal and ileal biopsy specimens in cats; although this distinction, between lymphoplasmacytic inflammation and small cell lymphoma, is more problematic than simply identifying neutrophilic inflammation. Although it is possible that inflammatory changes elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract were different to the duodenum, our hypothesis related to an infectious etiology for the localized neutrophilic inflammation and so our findings remain valid.",
