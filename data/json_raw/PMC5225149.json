            "text": "Background and Aims: The role of miR-34a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is controversial and several unresolved issues remain, including its expression pattern and relevance to tumor etiology, tumor stage and prognosis, and finally, its impact on apoptosis. Methods: miR-34a expression was assessed in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced non-metastatic HCC tissues by RT-Q-PCR. Huh-7 cells were transfected with miR-34a mimics and the impact of miR-34a was examined on 84 pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic genes using PCR array; its net effect was tested on cell viability via MTT assay. Results: miR-34a expression was up-regulated in HCC tissues. Moreover, miR-34a induced a large set of pro-apoptotic/anti-apoptotic genes, with a net result of triggering apoptosis and repressing cell viability. Conclusions: HCC-related differential expression of miR-34a could be etiology-based or stage-specific, and low expression of miR-34a may predict poor prognosis. This study's findings also emphasize the role of miR-34a in apoptosis.",

            "text": "Introduction microRNA (miR)-34a has emerged as an important miR in comprehensive research studies, and numerous studies have proposed its considerable impact on cell proliferation and survival. 1 miR-34a has several experimentally validated downstream target genes involved in cell cycle regulation, including NMYC, 2 CCND1, 3 CCNE2, CDK4, CDK6, 4 and C-MET. 4,5 These genes promote cells to proceed through G1 phase into S phase via the Rb-E2F signaling pathway, and ectopic expression of miR-34a was shown to induce cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. 6 Moreover, it was reported that overexpression of miR-34a could down-regulate CDC25C and phosphorylated CDC2 expression, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation via cell cycle G2 phase arrest. 7,8 miR-34a was reported to directly target YY1, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, 9 and induce apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines. 10 Furthermore, miR-34a ectopic expression in breast cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis, and miR-34a expression was found to be inversely correlated to BCL-2 and SIRT1 expression. 11 In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), two independent studies reported that miR-34a had no impact on apoptosis. 5,12 On the contrary, another research group showed that miR-34a increased caspase-3 and -7 activity and induced apoptosis. 13 Thus, the role of miR-34a in apoptosis in HCC is ambiguous. Another controversial aspect of miR-34a regards its pattern of expression and its relevance to the tumor etiology and stage. miR-34a was found to exhibit a different pattern of expression in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related HCC 14 than in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-induced HCC. 5,15 In addition, the expression level of miR-34a was found to vary between HCC tissues in clinical TNM stages III and IV as compared to that in stages I and II. 13 It was also reported that metastatic HCC tissues showed a significantly different miR-34a expression profile compared to non-metastatic tissues. 5,13 Despite these controversies, miR-34a has entered phase I clinical trials for liver cancer. 16 Thus, in this study, we first aimed to elucidate the discrepancies regarding miR-34a expression pattern via investigating miR-34a expression in a cohort of patients with HCV-University, Egypt. In addition, 19 healthy liver biopsies were obtained. The healthy liver tissues were obtained from liver donors who volunteered for lobar transplantation surgery for HCC patients. Healthy livers represented non-cirrhotic tissues, and all donors were negative for HCV and HBV infection. Written consent, from both the patient and the donor, to take liver tissues during the transplantation was obtained prior to the surgery. Patients were subjected to clinical assessment (results presented in Table 1). HCC was diagnosed in all patients by examining the stage and grade of the tumor. Liver function enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) and albumin levels in serum were measured. Also the presence of hepatotropic infections, such as presence of HCV or HBV, was checked. All patients were confirmed as non-metastatic with no extra-hepatic manifestations and no vascular invasion, in order to comply with the expanded Milan criteria (UCSF criteria) for liver transplantation (i.e. single tumor of <6.5 cm in diameter, or 2 or 3 tumors, each of #4.5 cm in diameter or with total tumor diameter #8 cm) as shown in Table 2. The majority of the patients (63.6%) had more than one focal lesion, as indicated in the pathology report. All experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of Kasr El Ainy Medical School in Cairo University and the ethical committee of the German University in Cairo and in accordance to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Interestingly, the expression of 26 pro-apoptotic genes was found to be up-regulated, while another 17 pro-apoptotic genes were found to be repressed ( Fig. 2a and 2b). Regarding the anti-apoptotic genes, miR-34a increased the expression level of 10 genes, although it down-regulated the expression of 8 genes (Fig. 2c and 2d). miR-34a did not show a significant impact on the expression of the 23 remaining genes. Our results showed that miR-34a induced the expression of key players involved in the activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, such as BAK ( Fig. 2a). BAK triggers mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which leads to the release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Then, APAF1 and cytochrome C form the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9 ultimately resulting in apoptotic cell death. 19 In our study, miR-34a was found to not only increase BAK expression but also to induce the expression of the downstream mediators of intrinsic apoptosis cytochrome C, APAF1 and caspase-9 ( Fig. 2a).",

            "text": "Induction of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways leads to activation of caspases-3, -6 and -7. 22 These executioner caspases mediate the cleavage of several proteins critical to cell survival, including actin, lamin, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and inhibitor of caspaseactivated DNase (ICAD). Cleavage of these proteins leads to molecular and morphological changes characteristic to apoptosis, including cell shrinking and membrane blebbing, disruption of nuclear membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation and impaired DNA repair. 23 Executioner caspases-3, -6 and -7 were all found to be induced by miR-34a in the present study ( Fig. 2a). This finding corroborates a previous study in which miR-34a ectopic overexpression in Hep3B cells and SNU449 cells was shown to promote apoptosis and induce caspase-3 and -7 activity. 13 Nonetheless, these findings challenge previous reports which did not observe any impact on apoptosis upon overexpressing miR-34a in HepG2 cells. 5,12 Finally, this study aimed to evaluate the net impact of miR-34a on cell viability using MTT assay. Results showed that forcing the expression of miR-34a in Huh-7 cells reduced the cell viability significantly (Fig. 3). This finding is in line with other studies reporting that after forcing miR-34a expression in HCC cells, a decrease in cell viability is observed. 13,15 In the current study, the decrease in cell viability could be explained by the induction of apoptosis, as revealed by the results of the PCR array. In addition, it is possible that the effect of miR-34a on cell viability could also occur via targeting of cell cycle genes, since previous studies have reported that miR-34a has validated targets involved in cell cycle regulation, including NMYC, 2 CCND1, 3 CCNE2, CDK4 and CDK6. 4 Fig. 3.

Together with findings from previous reports, the current data suggests that miR-34a expression pattern could be etiology-based and stage-specific, and low expression of miR-34a may predict poor prognosis. In this study, it was shown that miR-34a activates dozens of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, with a net effect of inducing apoptosis and repressing cell viability and, hence, emphasizing the role of miR-34a in apoptosis.",
