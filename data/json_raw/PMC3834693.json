Telomere length is a molecular marker of cell aging, and genomic instability due to telomere shortening has been linked to several aging-related diseases. A Ai im m: : To explore the effects of different doses of ultraviolet A (UVA) on the length of telomeres in human skin fibroblasts and partly reveal the mechanism of skin photoaging initiated by UVA irradiation. M Ma at te er ri ia al l a an nd d m me et th ho od ds s: Primary cultured human skin fibroblasts were irradiated with different doses of UVA light. Cell viability, cell cycle phase, \u03b2-galactosidase, and the length of telomeres were assessed by 3-(4,5-di me thylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, flow cytometry, cytochemical staining, and real-time polymerase chain reactions, respectively. R Re es su ul lt ts s: : After UVA irradiation, inhibited proliferation, S phase accumulation and increased expression of senescenceassociated \u03b2-galactosidase were observed in cultured fibroblasts. Moreover, the length of telomeres in UVA-treated cells was shortened in a dose-dependent manner as compared to controls (p < 0.05). C Co on nc cl lu us si io on ns s: : These results suggest that telomere length in human dermal fibroblasts can be shortened by a single high dosage of UVA radiation, and that acute photodamage might contribute to early photoaging in human skin via rapid telomere shortening. This study potentially provides the basis for better understanding of the molecular mechanism of photoaging."

It has been postulated that telomere shortening played an important role in photoaging [4,5]. Recent studies have suggested that intrinsic aging and photoaging share a common pathway involving telomere-generated signaling that is responsible for most clinical manifestations of skin aging [1,4,6]. However, an earlier study showed that telomere length did not differ significantly between sunexposed and sun-protected skin [7,8]. Thus, whether the length of telomere is shortened in photoaging remains unclear.",

            "text": "UVA doses below 10 J/cm 2 administered to fibroblasts in vitro are of physiological relevance as it is similar to the dose at which human skin is exposed in sunlight for 15-30 min during summer, at noon at a latitude of 30-35\u00b0N [16]. In this study, we found that the viability of cultured   fibroblasts decreased as the intensity of irradiation increased. Doses less than 10 J/cm 2 did not affect proliferation, suggesting that cell repair mechanisms can overcome the stress generated by irradiation at this intensi-ty. However, at doses over 10 J/cm 2 , the proliferation of fibroblast was inhibited, suggesting that the cytotoxicity induced by a larger dose of UVA cannot be repaired completely. Features of cell senescence, including growth arrest and increased \u03b2-galactosidase expression, were also observed following a single large dose of UVA. Progression through S phase is slowed in eukaryotic cells with damaged DNA, allowing time for DNA repair before the genome is replicated [17]. The S-M checkpoint depends on completion of DNA synthesis, preventing mitosis in the presence of incompletely replicated DNA due to replication inhibitors or DNA damage that blocks replication fork progression [18]. In our study, UVA irradiation of cultured fibroblasts resulted in cell cycle alterations, especially S phase accumulation, suggesting that UVA inhibits cell proliferation by inducing an S phase delay. Our data are consistent with a previous report [19] on the role of the DNA damage checkpoint response in UVA-induced inhibition of DNA replication. \u03b2-Galactosidase has been widely used to demonstrate the onset of cell senescence [20]. In this study, in groups irradiated with UVA doses higher than 10 J/cm 2 , the expression of the enzyme was significantly increased. Here, we confirm that cytotoxicity induced by a single large dose of UVA may accelerate the aging processes.",

Thus, acute photodamage might contribute to early photoaging in human skin as a consequence of rapid telomere shortening. Telomere dependent replicative senescence is an established stress-damage response [21]. UVA causes oxidative stress indirectly via reactive oxygen species generated after the absorption of light energy [22,23], and oxidative stress may lead to telomere shortening [24,25]. When telomeres reach a critical length, loop disruption may occur naturally [26], increasing the probability of telomere uncapping. It remains controversial whether telomere shortening results from accumulation of DNA damage at the telomere or the lack of certain repair mechanisms within human chromosomal DNA. However, recent data suggest that telomere-initiated senescence reflects a DNA damage checkpoint response that is activated with a direct contribution from dysfunctional telomeres [27]. The signaling pathway connecting telomere uncapping and replicative senescence appears to be the same as that activated by DNA damage [21].",
