Differences in coronary artery lesions between hypertensive and normotensive individuals of both genders at the Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) have not been clearly determined. Objective: To Investigate the calcium score (CS), CAD extent and characteristics of coronary plaques at CCTA in men and women with and without SAH. Methods: Prospective cross-sectional study of 509 patients undergoing CCTA for CAD diagnosis and risk stratification, from November 2011 to December 2012, at Instituto de Cardiologia Dante Pazzanese. Individuals were stratified according to gender and subdivided according to the presence (HT +) or absence (HT-) of SAH. Results: HT+ women were older (62.3 \u00b1 10.2 vs 57.8 \u00b1 12.8, p = 0.01). As for the assessment of CAD extent, the HT+ individuals of both genders had significant CAD, although multivessel disease is more frequent in HT + men. The regression analysis for significant CAD showed that age and male gender were the determinant factors of multivessel disease and CS \u2265 100. Plaque type analysis showed that SAH was a predictive risk factor for partially calcified plaques (OR = 3.9). Conclusion: Hypertensive men had multivessel disease more often than women. Male gender was a determinant factor of significant CAD, multivessel disease, CS \u2265 100 and calcified and partially calcified plaques, whereas SAH was predictive of partially calcified plaques."

The combined efforts of different countries aim to reduce 25% of the world CVD mortality by 2025. In most current programs, special attention is given to patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly those with diabetes mellitus (DM) dyslipidemia and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) 1,2 . SAH is an important risk factor for the onset of Major Cardiac Events (MACE), and its control is indicated in an attempt to improve prognosis in the middle and long term 3 . Regarding gender, the prevalence of SAH between men and women is similar; however, a higher rate is observed in men up to 50 years, which reverses after the fifth decade of life 4 .",

The main risk factors predictors of CAD were dyslipidemia and male gender. However, SAH was associated with the presence of partially calcified plaque (OR = 3.9). We emphasize the lack of difference between the groups with all levels of the CS, except for the important contribution of zero CS, more frequent in normotensive men."

Rivera et al. 12 , in a multivariate analysis, showed that SAH was predictive of any type of plaque in asymptomatic individuals, and as for the partially calcified plaque, they obtained similar results to those found in the present study, in which SAH (OR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.10 to 4.95) and male gender (OR = 5.54; 95% CI = 1.84 to 16.68) were predictors of this type of plaque. However, the study population was different from the sample by excluding previous DAC.      In a study that analyzed the type of plaque at CCTA between the group with and without metabolic syndrome (MS) 13 , it was observed that among the types of plaque, the highest frequency of partially calcified plaque was found in patients with MS. Older age and male gender were associated with both the presence of calcified and noncalcified plaque. At the adjusted analysis, MS was associated with partially calcified plaque, as well as male gender and age, data consistent with our results.",
