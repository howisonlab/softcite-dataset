Volumetric capnography (VC) uses the principle of gas washout and analyzes the pattern of CO 2 elimination as a function of expired volume. The main variables analyzed were end-tidal concentration of carbon dioxide (ETCO 2), Slope of phase 2 (Slp2), and Slope of phase 3 (Slp3) of capnogram, the curve which represents the total amount of CO 2 eliminated by the lungs during each breath. Objective: To investigate, in a group of patients with severe COPD, if the phenotypic analysis by CT could identify different subsets of patients, and if there was an association of CT findings and functional variables. Subjects and methods: Sixty-five patients with COPD Gold III-IV were admitted for clinical evaluation, high-resolution CT, and functional evaluation (spirometry, 6-minute walk test [6MWT], and VC). The presence and profusion of tomography findings were evaluated, and later, the patients were identified as having emphysema (EMP) or airway disease (AWD) phenotype. EMP and AWD groups were compared; tomography findings scores were evaluated versus spirometric, 6MWT, and VC variables. Results: Bronchiectasis was found in 33.8% and peribronchial thickening in 69.2% of the 65 patients. Structural findings of airways had no significant correlation with spirometric variables. Air trapping and EMP were strongly correlated with VC variables, but in opposite directions. There was some overlap between the EMP and AWD groups, but EMP patients had signicantly lower body mass index, worse obstruction, and shorter walked distance on 6MWT. Concerning VC, EMP patients had signicantly lower ETCO2, Slp2 and Slp3. Increases in Slp3 characterize heterogeneous involvement of the distal air spaces, as in AWD. Conclusion: Visual assessment and phenotyping of CT in COPD patients is feasible and may help identify functional and clinically different subsets of patients. VC may provide useful information about the heterogeneous involvement of lung structures in COPD.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently defined as a lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, which is usually progressive and associated with an inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, according to the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. 1 The airflow obstruction is usually associated with respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough, dyspnea, and presence of sputum. This is a preventable and treatable disease that has some systemic effects that interfere directly on the severity and prognosis. 1 Pathologically, COPD is characterized by involvement of large and medium, but especially, small airways, those with less than 2 mm in diameter. 2 There is also involvement of the lung parenchyma and vasculature, which are most prominent findings when there is pulmonary emphysema (EMP). The location of predominant structural lesions has a close relationship with functional manifestations, and this turns out to be a key point in the diagnosis of the different phenotypes of COPD. The involvement of the small airways, initially by inflammatory changes and then followed by fibrotic changes (constrictive bronchiolitis caused by scarring of the walls of the small airways), is a trademark of airflow limitation that occurs in chronic bronchitis. In EMP, it is accepted that the main cause of reduced airflow is the loss of lung elastic recoil due to reduction of elastic fibers, which occurs when the alveolar septa disappear. The relative importance of each of these components of the disease in each patient with COPD is not clear.",

Abscesses, sacculations, bullae, EMP, areas of collapse, and consolidation were also recorded. This scoring system was modified by the addition of an evaluation of mosaic perfusion. 25 In our chart (Table 1), we did an adaptation in order to facilitate its use for clinicians: bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, air trapping (expiration scan), mucoid plugs, tree-in-bud signal, bullae, and EMP were analyzed and scored in each lung lobe, so the score ranged from 0 to 77. Pulmonary artery/aorta (PA/Ao) ratio was also determined, measured at the pulmonary artery branch (#1 or .1).  Two physicians with expertise in reading lung CTs analyzed each exam. Before performing individual readings, they standardized the process in order to minimize inconsistencies. Any divergences were decided by consensus.",

Diseases of the small airways may be best evaluated by the analysis of the pattern of elimination of various gases. Spirometry measures flow, so it is best suited for analyzing disease processes that occur in the airways where flow does exist. From the 15th generation down to the alveoli, there is no movement of gases by convection (difference in pressure) because of the great cross-sectional area of the airspaces in this region of the lung. CT and spirometry are tests that assess different aspects of pulmonary diseases. CT assesses changes in lung structure, and spirometry evaluates the functional variables. CT may show small airway signals and the presence of EMP even when there is no functional compromising. The patients in this study were all severely obstructed, and this fact may have limited the capacity of spirometry to detect the lung function decline. After analyzing and scoring CT findings, visual evaluation was used to determine which phenotypes (EMP or AWD) prevailed, by proceedings described previously in this text.",

The Slp3 should therefore be small. Increases in Slp3 happen in situations of heterogeneous involvement of the distal air spaces, which lead to heterogeneous distribution of the air in these regions and reduced contact area between CO 2 that crosses the alveolar-capillary membrane and the renewed air that arrived through the previous inspiration. Larger values of Slp3/V e and Slp3/ETCO 2 in patients suggest existence of structural damage to the peripheral lung, which promotes this heterogeneous distribution of ventilation. 13,14 Bronchial tree branching patterns lead to the existence of paths of varied lengths from the first bronchial branching down to the alveolar region. The shortest paths are responsible for the first increases of CO 2 concentration in exhaled air and are the cause of sudden rises in CO 2 concentrations in Slp2 of the volumetric capnogram. They are more numerous in the apical regions of the lung, which are preferentially affected in patients with smoking-related EMP. The decrease in these shorter pathways in EMP patients may explain lower Slp2 values. Another explanation for the decreased Slp2 may come from mechanical ventilation of patients with EMP. The difficulty in exhaling air during expiration caused by reduced lung elasticity shifts the point of equal pressure to more peripheral airways that have less thick walls and therefore are liable to undergo collapse by forced expiration. Although these airways are located in outermost regions, they are still out of the lung's volumetric region where the smaller 2 mm diameter airways are located, too numerous along the long paths to the alveoli of the middle fields and lower lung. The collapse of more shorter path of the central airways may also decrease Slp2.",

In fact, a better correlation between the data obtained from gas elimination curves and HRCT is not unexpected.",

Although this is a subjective and observer-dependent method, if it is done in a systematic way, it may provide useful information to manage severe COPD patients with more individual basis. Automatic quantitative assessment of EMP or airway involvement seems to be more accurate, but this software is not available for everyone. Our study has also some limitations. First, it is known that air trapping may influence results of some functional variables, such as vital capacity. So, it would be interesting to have data such as total lung capacity, residual volume, and DlCO. Unfortunately, such measurements were not performed because we did not have this equipment. Second, the choice of evaluating only severe COPD patients may pose a bias because these patients are more prone to having structural abnormalities in airways and lung tissue. On the other hand, these severe COPD patients are the most difficult to manage, and spirometry, which is the usual exam for evaluating severity of COPD, seems to supply limited information about them.",

Spirometry, as the only means to characterize COPD patients, has proven insufficient, especially for severe cases, because patients may have a huge function decrease without great changes in spirometric values. VC may be a useful tool to detect and estimate the magnitude of the heterogeneity of disease distribution, which is the main finding in airway phenotype of COPD. Using different tools that assess distinct dimensions of COPD, such as CT, 6MWT, and VC can help us understand the various COPDs and their consequences.",
