We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare-seeking behaviors of women with UI. Methods: We included 9,873 women over the age of 20 years who had participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV. The condition of UI was defined as answering \"yes\" to the question \"Do you have UI?\" Additionally, health care seeking behavior for UI was defined as answering \"yes\" to \"Have you ever been treated for UI?\" The EuroQoL-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) descriptive system was used to evaluate QoL. Results: The mean age of our sample was 49.7 years. The overall prevalence of UI was 7.9%. The prevalence of UI significantly increased with age. The rate of healthcare-seeking behavior for UI also significantly increased with age. However, the rate of healthcare seeking for UI was significantly lower when compared to the prevalence of UI. In our multivariate analysis, age, body mass index, and marriage were significantly and independently associated with UI. As the severity of all the subscales of EQ-5D increased, the unadjusted odds ratio for UI also increased. After adjusting for potential confounders, the subscales of mobility, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression from the EQ-5D were significantly associated with UI. Conclusions: UI is a common disease and is significantly associated with QoL. Our results suggest the need for developing preventive measures and treatment policies for UI.",

UI is an important health problem resulting in psychological, social, and hygienic impairment, thus affecting the lives of the patients as well as their family [2]. However, there are no studies on the overall prevalence, risk factors, quality of life (QoL), and healthcare-seeking behaviors of women with UI in South Korea. The only available data are from rural areas and sanatoriums [3][4][5]. The aforementioned issues need to be addressed in order to promote health and organize the healthcare services related to UI. Therefore, we undertook the present study using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV (KNHANES) to investigate information about adult female UI.",

This finding was lower than the overall UI prevalence rates reported in Japanese women over the age of 40 years (53.7%) [12] and Taiwanese women aged 65 years or older (27.7%) [13]. However, it is important to note that the response rate of the Japanese survey was 53% and data were collected by mailed survey. In addition, the Taiwanese study only included women over the age of 65 years, and population sampling was performed by randomly sampled town populations. These factors may account for the difference in the observed study results.",

We were unable to assess parity as a risk factor because this information was not available in KNHANES IV. However, marital status, which is related to parity, showed a significant association with UI. The number of unmarried mothers in Korea is lower than that in western countries, and Korean traditions dictate that childbirth should follow marriage. Thus, marriage could be interpreted as a proxy for parity in this study.

A study of UI in Japanese women showed that only 3% had ever consulted doctors or other healthcare professionals [12,16]. Chinese data show that the consultation rate was 25%.

Another study from the United States reported that the UI group was almost twice as likely to feel depressed as the non-UI group, and that UI had a significant negative impact on all aspects of QoL after adjusting for comorbidities and demographic differences [18].

In up to 70% of women with mild stress UI, pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises can result in better control of the bladder when coughing, laughing, sneezing, or exercising [19]. In addition, long-term follow-up studies of surgical treatment (tension-free vaginal tape) for severe stress UI report that the cure rate ranges from 77% to 84.7% [20,21]. Furthermore, diverse treatment options (anticholinergics, alpha-blocker, botulinum toxin A, and neuromodulation) are available based on the patient's condition and the type of UI (urge, mixed, overflow, and functional/neurogenic UI) [22]. Treatment of UI means improving the patient' s QoL [23,24]. However, compared with the prevalence rate of UI in Korean women, the consultation rate for UI is significantly low. Recently, the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service reported that the number of anti-incontinence surgeries have increased from 5,944 cases in 2001 to 44,691 cases in 2006.",
