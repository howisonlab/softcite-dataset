            "text": "G lobal warming is one of the most debated topics among environmentalists and politicians because of its implications in biodiversity conservation and human welfare 1,2. Scientific evidence supports a link between this unequivocal and continuing rise in average temperatures over the last 130 years and human-induced increments in atmospheric concentrations of some gases such as carbon dioxide, methane or nitrous oxide (globally called greenhouse gases, GHG) 3,4. Thus, in 1997 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) developed the Kyoto Protocol, committing parties to setting internationally binding emission reduction targets. However, although the initiative is outstanding, policies have been weakly applied, and attempts to improve them have seen little success 5. In fact, global GHG emissions have accelerated since 2000 6. The future is even more uncertain as some new human activities may be leading to novel pathways for GHG emissions. An example of a new source of GHG emerged after the recent mad cow crisis in Europe. On this continent, the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in 2001 and the detection of the variant (vCJD) and new variant (nvCJD) of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans led to the passing of sanitary legislation (Regulation EC 1774/2002) that greatly restricted the use of animal by-products not intended for human consumption (ABPs). Under this legislation, carcasses of domestic animals had to be collected from farms and transformed or destroyed in authorised plants, not only contradicting the obligations and efforts of member states to conserve scavenger species 7-9 , but also potentially generating an unprecedented source of GHG emissions through carcass transportation, transformation and incineration. Thus, while the European Commission is attempting to reduce GHG emissions by applying an assortment of policies and technologies 10 , it is also potentially putting policies in place that increase emissions by replacing an ecological service that has been provided by scavengers for millennia 11 .",

In this paper we assess a novel source of GHG emissions emerged following a controversial policy decision. After the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Europe, the sanitary regulation required that livestock carcasses were collected from farms and transformed or destroyed in authorised plants, contradicting not only the obligations of member states to conserve scavenger species but also generating unprecedented GHG emission. However, how much of this emission could be prevented in the return to traditional and natural scenario in which scavengers freely remove livestock carcasses is largely unknown. Here we show that, in Spain (home of 95% of European vultures), supplanting the natural removal of dead extensive livestock by scavengers with carcass collection and transport to intermediate and processing plants meant the emission of 77,344 metric tons of CO 2 eq. to the atmosphere per year, in addition to annual payments of ca. $50 million to insurance companies. Thus, replacing the ecosystem services provided by scavengers has not only conservation costs, but also important and unnecessary environmental and economic costs.",

Moreover, some regions lack the specific legislation required to apply the European guidelines at the local scale, and future reversion to more restrictive rules due to new sanitary pressures cannot be ruled out. Thus, modelling the current scenario of GHG emissions linked to the artificial removal of livestock carcasses may help to broaden our understanding of the dimensions of supplanting this ecosystem service provided by scavengers. Mapping ecosystem services, or the consequences of their suppression, has been suggested as an essential step to minimize the anthropogenic footprint through the implementation and improvement of ''win-win'' strategies -those benefiting both biodiversity conservation and human welfare, as well as the reconciliation of conflicting policies 19,20 . Until now, however, how vertebrate animals might be allied in the fight against climate change, hence benefiting humanity through preventing the release of carbon and nitrogen stored in terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere is largely unknown 21 , and never has been spatially assessed.",

Briefly, this regulation mandates that livestock carcasses be collected from farms within 24 (cattle) or 48 h (other livestock) after death and moved to processing plants, where they are subjected to different treatments depending on their risk to public and animal health (i.e., if they are ruminant or non-ruminant carcasses). However, due to the long distance at which these plants are located, most livestock collected is first stored, unprocessed, at intermediate plants. At the end, carcasses can be used for industrial purposes (e.g. to produce organic fertilizers) or be transported to incineration plants or approved landfills 22 . Fossil fuel combustion associated with the transport sector is one of the main sources of GHG emissions worldwide 23 , and thus our goal is to demonstrate how much of this emission could be prevented in the return to traditional and natural systems in which scavengers freely remove livestock carcasses, or conversely, how much GHG is generated by supplanting this ecological service. We recreated the process of carcass collection and transport and the associated generation of GHG in peninsular Spain, where the majority of European vulture populations is located (ca. 95%) 7,9 .",

We calculated GHG emissions associated with carcass transport according to IPCC 24 . GHG emissions are quantified as metric tons of CO 2 equivalents. As an indicator of the capacity of the environment to provide the supplanted ecosystem service, we used information from the National Biodiversity Inventory to cross the estimated GHG emissions with the distance of each grid centre to the nearest breeding site, and with the richness per grid of obligate scavengers (griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous Aegypius monachus, Egyptian Neophron percnopterus and bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus).",

The removal of livestock carcasses from the field and their disposal at only a few authorised feeding points proved to have more negative than positive effects for the long-term viability of vulture and other scavenger populations 8,25 . Our findings suggest an additional argument in favour of traditional, more natural systems of livestock carcass removal. In Spain, emissions from the transport sector increased by 43.7% between 1990 and 2012, and currently account for 23.7% of total GHG emissions. According to our results, the emissions associated with the transport of extensive livestock carcasses represented 0.1% of the total national transport emissions in 2012 26 . For comparison, our estimate signifies 25, 15, 8 and 4% of total national emissions arising from rice cultivation, burning of agricultural residuals in the field, the chemical industry and sewage treatment, respectively 27 . It is worth to remark that this estimate corresponds only to one part of livestock carcass treatment, such that emissions would increase with the inclusion of the transformation and incineration of carcasses. Thus, further research is needed to complete the estimation of the total GHG emission linked to whole application of the actual sanitary regulation.",

Indeed, the removal rate of livestock carcasses by scavengers in Spain (median: 166 min for predictable and 182 min for unpredictable carcasses) 15 is faster than figures depicted in the legislation. Strikingly, regions with the largest amounts of CO 2 emissions are also those supporting the largest vulture populations, suggesting that, in the absence of sanitary constraints, vultures would have removed most of the extensive livestock carcasses from the field without unnecessary environmental costs. In addition, this EC regulation also entails economic costs other than those previously mentioned (i.e., derived from the excess of CO 2 ). The annual payment made by farmers and regional and national administrations to Spanish insurance companies for the artificial removal and processing of extensive livestock carcasses was ca. $50 million in 2012 31 . Environmental and economic savings associated to natural carcass removal have also been identified in other European countries hosting vultures, such as France, in which livestock carcass management strategies differ. However, due to the restricted geographic distribution of the main scavenger species, the griffon vulture (720 breeding pairs at one reintroduction site in the Grands Causses region, Massif Central, France), figures are substantially lower than those calculated in Spain (8.42-33.11 tons of CO 2 per year, depending on the simulated scenario) 21 .",

Therefore, the return to the traditional system in which vultures and other scavengers freely exploit the carcasses of extensive livestock is highly recommended from multiple points of view. Humans and scavengers have coexisted for millennia, and vultures have traditionally provided important ecosystem services such as disease and pest control, nutrient cycling, cultural inspiration and recreational activities 11 . Replacing some of these services, as shown here, not only has conservation costs but also unnecessary environmental and economic costs, which can be saved if we simply let nature do its job.",

We simulated the movement of carcasses from farms to processing plants directly or indirectly, through intermediate plants, following the scheme shown in the Fig. 1. We estimated the distance travelled by carcasses using the main national paved road network and the network analysis extension in ArcGIS 10.1. As the location of each farm was not available, we considered the center of each 10 3 10 km grid to be the point of origin (i.e., the farm) from which carcasses were moved. From these points, we calculated the distance travelled by trucks to the nearest plant. If this plant was a processing plant, then carcass movement was considered complete. If this plant was an intermediate plant, another truck was used to complete the transport of the carcasses to processing plants. In our analysis, movements from farms (i.e., grid centers) to intermediate or processing plants were performed daily, using 7.5 t rigid trucks of 230 hp, while movements from intermediate to processing plants occurred weekly and used 24 t articulated trucks of 340 hp. Vehicle types were determined by direct information from companies and regional regulations. We assumed that daily trucks collected all the carcasses generated within a grid cell until they reached their full load (7.5 t). Trucks moving carcasses from intermediate to processing plants were also completely loaded. Typically, more than one truck per week moved from an intermediate plant to a processing plant. All trips were calculated twice, as trucks must make the same trip in both directions. Intermediate and processing plants were geographically located using information provided by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment and the Autonomous Communities 35 . Distance calculations were made using the shortest road between origin and destination points (i.e., farms to intermediate or processing plants, and intermediate plants to processing plants), and prioritizing road type from highest to lowest speed (i.e., highways, national roads, autonomic roads, streets, and unpaved roads) 36 .",

Thus, we calculated the emissions of these three gases separately as E(i) 5 AD * EF(i), where i is the gas type (CO 2 , CH 4 or N 2 O), AD is activity data and EF is the emission factor, 73.7 t/TJ for CO 2 37 and 0.0039 t/TJ for CH 4 and N 2 O 24 . Activity data (AD) was calculated as FC * FD * LHV, where FC is fuel consumption, FD is fuel density and LHV is lower heat value. FD (0.845 kg/l) and LHV (0.0424 TJ/t) were obtained from the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment 33 . FC was calculated by multiplying the distance covered by each truck by the expected average fuel consumption per km expected by each type of truck 24 . We considered that all trucks of the same type consumed the same quantity of fuel per km regardless of their load (0.21 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from farms to the nearest plant and 0.26 l/km for trucks used to move carcasses from intermediate plants to processing plants) 38 . We assumed that all trucks used oil/diesel fuel and were 11 yrs old, such that motors are thermally stabilized and do not have catalysts. These assumptions are based on the fact that in 2011, ca. 90% of trucks and vans in Spain were diesels, and their average age was 11 yrs old 39 . As fuel combustion is not perfect and a small portion may lead to residuals (ash and soot), we included an ''oxidation factor'' which expresses the ratio of CO 2 emitted per fuel unit (0.99) 37 . Results are presented as CO 2 equivalents (CO 2 eq.), a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of CO 2 that would have the same global warming potential (GWP) when measured over a specified timescale (100 years) 24 . GWP values for CH 4 and N 2 O were 34 and 298, respectively, with climate-carbon feedback values and lifetimes taken from 40 .

We focused on the breeding population, which represents approximately two-thirds of the total vulture population. We calculated the distance of each 10 3 10 km grid center to the nearest breeding site (i.e., nest or colony) of any obligate scavenger. Because of the high daily mobility of these species (griffon vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites; cinereous vultures: up to 86 km from breeding sites; bearded vultures: up to 45 km from breeding sites; Egyptian vultures: up to 70 km from breeding sites) 12,41 , we also calculated their richness (i.e., number of species) in a 100 km buffer around each 10 3 10 km grid cell. We used Generalized Linear Models (1/mu 2 link function and inverse Gaussian error distribution) to explore the relationship between metric tons of CO 2 eq. per grid and distance to the nearest obligate scavenger breeding site. Metric tons of CO 2 eq. in a 100 km buffer around grids with different species richness (from 0 to 4) were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. All analyses were performed in R 42 .
