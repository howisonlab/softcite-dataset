            "text": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in cancer development and treatment. Recent data implicate the tumor suppressor BRCA1 in regulating oxidative stress, but the molecular mechanism and the impact in BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, we show that BRCA1 regulates Nrf2-dependent antioxidant signaling by physically interacting with Nrf2 and promoting its stability and activation. BRCA1-deficient mouse primary mammary epithelial cells show low expression of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant enzymes and accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that impair survival in vivo. Increased Nrf2 activation rescues survival and ROS levels in BRCA1-null cells. Interestingly, 53BP1 inactivation, which has been shown to alleviate several defects associated with BRCA1 loss, rescues survival of BRCA1-null cells without restoring ROS levels. We demonstrate that estrogen treatment partially restores Nrf2 levels in the absence of BRCA1. Our data suggest that Nrf2-regulated antioxidant response plays a crucial role in controlling survival downstream of BRCA1 loss. The ability of estrogen to induce Nrf2 posits an involvement of an estrogen-Nrf2 connection in BRCA1 tumor suppression. Lastly, BRCA1-mutated tumors retain a defective antioxidant response that increases the sensitivity to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the role of BRCA1 in regulating Nrf2 activity suggests important implications for both the etiology and treatment of BRCA1-related cancers.",

            "text": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a complex role in cancer development and progression (Cairns et al., 2011). Redox homeostasis is fundamental to maintaining normal cellular functions and ensuring cell survival of cancer cells with aberrant metabolism. Although elevated ROS levels can be protumorigenic and induce tumor formation through their mutagenic properties (Shibutani et al., 1991), high ROS levels can also limit tumor formation. As such, reduced intracellular ROS levels through the action of antioxidant signaling have been demonstrated to promote cell transformation and tumorigenic phenotypes. In vitro antioxidant exposure increases cell survival and anchorageindependent growth in premalignant mammary epithelial cells (MECs;Schafer et al., 2009). In cancer cell lines, the antioxidant genes GCLC and HMOX1, identified through a genome-wide shRNA screen, are essential for cell survival (Marcotte et al., 2012). In addition, is the result of impaired Nrf2-driven antioxidant signaling. We demonstrated that BRCA1 is a novel Nrf2-binding protein that affects Keap1-mediated Nrf2 ubiquitination activity, thereby controlling Nrf2 stability and activation. In BRCA1deficient cells, up-regulation of the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway through inactivation of Keap1 rescues cell survival defects and ROS levels induced by BRCA1 loss-offunction. Interestingly, human BRCA1-mutated breast tumor cells also retain a defective Nrf2 antioxidant response that impinges on their sensitivity to oxidative stress and cisplatin treatment. Our work establishes a physiological function of BRCA1 in ROS regulation in the mammary gland and sheds light on the role of oxidative stress in BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression with important therapeutic implications.",

Targeted Brca1 deletion to the mammary gland epithelium was achieved by crossing B1 f/f mice to K14cre mice (Jonkers et al., 2001) to obtain K14cre;Brca1 f/f mice (KB1 f/f ) along with K14cre (K) and K14cre;Bf/+ (KB1 f/+ ) control mice. K14 is mainly expressed in mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and basal cells (Shackleton et al., 2006). However, analysis of pMECs isolated from females obtained by crossing K14cre mice with a transgenic strain expressing the red fluorescent protein Tomato (Muzumdar et al., 2007) showed that K14cre was active in both MaSCs/ basal and luminal cells (not depicted). PCR with genomic DNA from pMECs isolated from #4 mammary glands of B1 +/+ , B1 f/+ , B1 f/f , and KB1 f/f mice showed cre-mediated deletion of Brca1 exons 5-13 only in KB1 f/f samples (Fig. 1 E). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) with genomic DNA confirmed a significant reduction of Brca1 WT allele in KB1 f/f pMECs (Fig. 1 F), which correlated with low Brca1 mRNA expression in KB1 f/f pMECs compared with K and KB1 f/+ controls (Fig. 1 G). Consequently, KB1 f/f pMECs also had low Brca1 protein levels (Fig. 1 H). Intracellular ROS staining showed that KB1 f/f pMECs had higher ROS than K and KB1 f/+ pMECs (Fig. 1 I).",

Oncogenic events that regulate Nrf2 transcription or alter its protein stability would presumably provide a survival advantage. Indeed, oncogenic K-Ras or c-Myc transcriptionally regulates Nrf2 to activate an antioxidant program and lower intracellular ROS that is required for cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (DeNicola et al., 2011). Nrf2 has also been implicated in controlling cell proliferation downstream of the hyperactivated oncogenic PI3K/Akt pathway (Mitsuishi et al., 2012). In breast cancer, deregulation of NRF2 stability by KEAP1 silencing through promoter hypermethylation has been recently reported in a subset of tumors that are more frequently estrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (Barbano et al., 2013). Although KEAP1 mutations are rare, genome-wide sequencing of human breast cancers identified a KEAP1 mutation (C23Y) that disrupts its interaction with NRF2, leading to increased NRF2 protein stability and antioxidant signaling in a subset of human breast cancers (Sj\u00f6blom et al., 2006;Nioi and Nguyen, 2007).",

Because these tumors are characterized by high genomic instability, lack of DNA repair as the result of BRCA1 inactivation is considered the main cause of tumor formation. However, new functions of BRCA1 such as the regulation of the oncogenic microRNA 155 (Chang et al., 2011), the maintenance of heterochromatin structure (Zhu et al., 2011), and the modulation of oxidative stress (Vurusaner et al., 2012) have been recently discovered. In the context of oxidative stress, BRCA1 overexpression in human breast cancer cells up-regulates several antioxidant genes and reduces H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage and apoptosis (Bae et al., 2004;Saha et al., 2009). Although Brca1 loss-of-function in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Brca1 \ue04411/\ue04411 mutant mice shows higher ROS levels than cells from Brca1 WT mice and is more sensitive to apoptosis induced by oxidative stress (Cao et al., 2007), the mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates oxidative stress and its impact in BRCA1associated tumorigenesis has not been fully uncovered.",

We used a Brca1 conditional knockout mouse (Liu et al., 2007) to specifically delete the Brca1 gene in the mammary gland. Although Brca1 deletion under the control of K14-or K6a-driven cre recombinase does not lead to any observable changes in the mammary gland (Liu et al., 2007;Smart et al., 2011), our study of primary and immortalized mouse and human BRCA1-deficient MECs shows that BRCA1 deficiency results in ROS accumulation in these cells. This effect When we evaluated Nrf2 expression in KB1 f/f pMECs, we found that both mRNA (Fig. 2 A) and protein levels ( Fig. 2 B) were significantly lower in Brca1-deficient cells compared with control cells (B1 f/f ). These data are supported by previous findings that BRCA1 binds the Nrf2 promoter and regulates its transcription (Kang et al., 2011). Consistent with low Nrf2 expression, KB1 f/f pMECs showed reduced mRNA levels of the Nrf2 transcriptional targets Nqo1 and Hmox1 compared with controls (Fig. 2,C and D).",

Interestingly, Brca1 silencing by specific surface markers CD24 and CD49f ( Joshi et al., 2010) revealed that both KB1 f/f MaSC-enriched basal cells (CD24 + CD49f high ) and luminal cells (CD24 + CD49f low ) showed elevated ROS compared with B1 f/f controls (Fig. 1 J).

As shown in Fig. 3 D, Keap1-mediated ubiquitination of GFP-NRF2 was abrogated by Myc-BRCA1 overexpression. Myc-BRCA1 was unable to dissociate the NRF2-KEAP1 complex because His-KEAP1 equally immunoprecipitated using GFP-NRF2 with or without Myc-BRCA1 ( Fig. 3 D). Thus, upon oxidative stress, BRCA1 up-regulation interferes with KEAP1-mediated NRF2 ubiquitination, resulting in NRF2 protein accumulation.",

NRF2 and KEAP1 interaction is based on a two-site substrate recognition model at two distinct domains of NRF2, the ETGE and DLG motifs, known as the \"hinge and latch mechanism\" (Li and Kong, 2009). We determined the possibility that BRCA1 interfered with KEAP1 binding to one of these two domains. HA-tagged WT NRF2 and HA-tagged NRF2 mutants where the 29 DLG or 79 ETGE motif were replaced with alanine residues (Chen et al., 2009) were expressed in 293FT cells along with Myc-BRCA1 and His-KEAP1. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged NRF2 proteins showed that mutation of 79 ETGE diminished both KEAP1 and BRCA1 binding to NRF2, whereas replacement of 29 DLG did not affect either KEAP1 or BRCA1 affinity for NRF2 ( Fig. 3 E).",

KB1 f/f Luc f/+ pMECs produced Luc-positive outgrowths by 4 wk after injection, similar to control KLuc f/+ pMECs, but by 8 wk, Luc activity in KB1 f/f Luc f/+ pMECs was progressively lost until barely detectable at 24 wk after injection (Fig. 4, B and C). Genomic DNA qPCR in pMECs isolated from 4-wk-old KB1 f/f Luc f/+ outgrowths confirmed low levels of Brca1 WT allele compared with KLuc f/+ control cells, suggesting that the majority of pMECs lacked Brca1 expression (Fig. 4 D).

Lentiviruses were produced in 293FT packaging cells transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. Cells were infected with lentiviruses in the presence of 8 \u00b5g/ml Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 (HMECs) and 18 h (COMMA-1D; pMECs). Cells were cultured for 24 h after infection before antibiotic selection with 2-4 \u00b5g/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich). pMECs were in vivo injected the day after infection without antibiotic selection.",
