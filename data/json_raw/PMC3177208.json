            "text": "Polyadenylation of mRNA in human mitochondria is crucial for gene expression and perturbation of poly(A) tail length has been linked to a human neurodegenerative disease. Here we show that 2 0-phosphodiesterase (2 0-PDE), (hereafter PDE12), is a mitochondrial protein that specifically removes poly(A) extensions from mitochondrial mRNAs both in vitro and in mitochondria of cultured cells. In eukaryotes, poly(A) tails generally stabilize mature mRNAs, whereas in bacteria they increase mRNA turnover. In human mitochondria, the effects of increased PDE12 expression were transcript dependent. An excess of PDE12 led to an increase in the level of three mt-mRNAs (ND1, ND2 and CytB) and two (CO1 and CO2) were less abundant than in mitochondria of control cells and there was no appreciable effect on the steady-state level of the remainder of the mitochondrial transcripts. The alterations in poly(A) tail length accompanying elevated PDE12 expression were associated with severe inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, and consequently respiratory incompetence. Therefore, we propose that mRNA poly(A) tails are important in regulating protein synthesis in human mitochondria, as it is the case for nuclear-encoded eukaryotic mRNA."

            "text": "Mitochondria are vital organelles as they provide energy to the cell via the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The 16.6 kb circular human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and 13 essential protein components of the OXPHOS complexes (1). The remaining proteins of the mitochondrial proteome (>99%), including all factors necessary for the maintenance and expression of mtDNA, are encoded by the nucleus. Both mtDNA strands (termed H and L) are almost entirely transcribed from the promoters located in the control non-coding region. Resulting polycistronic RNA molecules are then processed to produce mRNAs, rRNAs and tRNAs (2). Human mitochondrial mRNAs (mt-mRNAs) released by this processing do not contain introns and lack any cap or modification at the 5 0 -end; however, they do have $50 adenosine residues added at the 3 0 -terminus by a dedicated mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (3,4). Seven of the 13 open reading frames (ORFs) require polyadenylation to create a translation stop codon (5).",

            "text": "Regulation of human mitochondrial RNA (mt-RNA) surveillance and turnover has not been well characterized thus far (6,7); also the regulatory mechanisms that control mitochondrial translation are poorly understood (8). In many systems, RNA polyadenylation plays an important role both in controlling mRNA stability and in modulating translation (9). The human mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase (hmtPAP) responsible for the synthesis of the mitochondrial poly(A) extensions has been identified (3,4), however, inactivation of this enzyme did not yield a clear answer to the role of poly(A) extensions in the stability of mt-RNAs. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of hmtPAP led to shortening of mitochondrial 3 0 -poly(A) extensions, but this either did not affect the stability (3) or resulted in decreased steady-state levels of some mt-mRNAs (4,10). Furthermore, analysis of the ATP6/8 mt-mRNA (RNA14) harbouring a microdeletion in the translation stop codon in a patient-derived cell line showed that this message has shortened poly(A) tails and is less stable, consistent with the poly(A) tail stabilizing the ATP6/8 mRNA (11). Another approach based upon mitochondrial targeting of a poly(A)-specific 3 0exoribonuclease PARN led to efficient RNA deadenylation; however, this had a variable effect on mt-mRNA steady-state levels, increasing or decreasing particular mRNAs with no effect on others (12). Another previous study showed that a fraction of the mt-RNA is truncated and internally polyadenylated, consistent with the possibility that a poly(A)-dependent degradation pathway exists in human mitochondria (13). Also, oligoadenylation at the 3 0 -termini has been suggested to precede the addition of long poly(A) tails, (14,15), but to date no enzyme responsible for the synthesis of oligo(A) extensions has been identified. By analogy with the role of RNA polyadenylation in the cytosol of eukaryotes, poly(A) tails may also play a role in modulating mitochondrial translation. However, this potential function has received very little attention thus far (12).",

Human PDE12 shares the same general domain architecture ( Figure 1B) and all key catalytic residues with other EEP deadenylases (Supplementary Figure S1).

The degradation of the 5 0 -end-labelled A 25 substrate resulted in a progressive and sequential appearance of RNA fragments of lower molecular mass suggesting that the enzyme hydrolyses RNA in the 3 0 !5 0 direction. The addition of a phosphate group at the 3 0 -end of RNA (substrate A 25 pCp) completely inhibited RNA degradation, whereas the analogous RNA substrate with a 3 0 -hydroxyl group (A 25 pC-OH) was efficiently degraded by the wild-type enzyme ( Figure 3A).

PDE12 preferred A 25 and U 25 as substrates, whereas C 25 and in particular G 25 were poorly degraded. The specificity of PDE12 towards poly(A) tails was further characterized on RNA substrates containing: (i) a 111 nt-long 3 0 -portion of the ND1 human mitochondrial gene (3 0 ND1) or (ii) the same 3 0 -portion of ND1 containing a 50 nt poly(A) tail (3 0 ND1-A 50 ).

Incubation of recombinant PDE12, but not the E351A mutant, with the polyadenylated substrates (3 0 ND1-A 50 or 3 0 CO2-A 50 ) for 30 min resulted in a size change consistent with the removal of the poly(A) tail ( Figure 3C, compare lanes 4 and 5 or 10 and 11).

            "text": "Based on the in vitro data (Figure 3), a high dose of PDE12 in mitochondria is predicted to shorten poly(A) tails. In order to determine the effect of PDE12 on RNA poly(A) tail length of mitochondrial transcripts, recombinant PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant was expressed in HEK293T cells. Both proteins were equally stable in human mitochondria ( Figure 4A). In order to map the exact changes in mt-RNA species, total RNA was isolated parental HEK293T cells. The length and sequence of mitochondrial transcripts ND1 and CO2 were analysed after PCR amplification, circularization, reverse transcription and cloning (cRT-PCR). All mitochondrial transcripts analyzed preserved the normal 5 0 -end, but in approximately half of the CO2 transcripts the length of the poly(A) tail was reduced to 40 adenines or less (48 and 54% for 2 and 4 days of PDE12 overexpression, respectively); all of the ND1 transcripts had poly(A) tails shorter than 40 adenines after 2 or 4 days of PDE12 overexpression ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Table S2). In $8 and 41% of the CO2 and ND1 transcripts, respectively, the poly(A) tail was lost completely 4 days after PDE12 induction. Similarly to the data obtained in vitro ( Figure 3C), RNA truncation of the ND1 and CO2 transcripts by PDE12 did not stop at the beginning of the poly(A) tract, but continued for up to 8 nt, into the 3 0 -termini of the transcripts (Supplementary Table S2). Some of the truncated ND1 transcripts were re-adenylated ( Supplementary Table S2). Mitochondrial transcripts of cells overexpressing the E351A catalytic mutant were indistinguishable from those of control cells ( Figure 4B). These data indicate that PDE12 can degrade poly(A) tails in human mitochondria.",

Induction of expression of the PDE12 transgene resulted in a size reduction of mt-mRNAs consistent with the removal of the poly(A) from the mitochondrial transcripts ( Figure 4C). Deadenylation had transcript-specific effects on the stability of individual mt-RNAs.

There was little change in the steady-state levels of the remaining mt-RNAs: 12 S-rRNA, 16 S-rRNA, ND4, ND5, ND6, CO3 and ATP6/8 mRNAs were within 15% of the starting level, after 4 days of PDE12 induction ( Figure 4D). Overexpression of the E351A catalytic mutant did not affect the steady-state level of mt-RNAs (data not shown) consistent with the retention of poly(A) tails ( Figure 4B). Although PDE12 has no detectable deoxyribonuclease activity ( Figure 3A), it might perturb mtDNA metabolism in some way. However, mtDNA copy number was unchanged in cells expressing PDE12 ( Figure 4E).",

Induction of PDE12, but not E351A, resulted in greater acidification of growth media (Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that elevated expression of PDE12 results in increased dependence on glycolytic as oppose to mitochondrial ATP production. Furthermore, PDE12 transgene expressing cells had a reduced growth rate when cultured in medium containing 25 mM glucose (generation times: PDE12 = 1.42 \u00b1 0.06, HEK293T = 1.27 \u00b1 0.03 and E351A = 1.30 \u00b1 0.03 days) and the growth impairment was accentuated when the cells' reliance on mitochondrial ATP production was increased by culturing them in medium containing galactose as the sole carbon source (generation times: PDE12 = 2.17 \u00b1 0.13, HEK293T = 1.51 \u00b1 0.04 and E351A = 1.48 \u00b1 0.03 days) ( Figure 5A).

About 8.5 pmols of PDE12.Strep2.Flag or the E351A catalytic mutant were incubated with synthetic transcripts produced by run-off T7 transcription in the presence of radioactive UTP. The following RNAs were tested: 111 nt-long 3 0 -region of the ND1 ORF (3 0 ND1, lanes 1-3), 111 nt-long 3 0 -part of the ND1 ORF containing a 50 nt poly(A) tail (3 0 ND1-A 50 , lanes 4-6), 111-nt long 3 0 -part of the CO2 ORF (3 0 CO2, lanes 7-9) or 111 nt-long 3 0 -part of the CO2 ORF containing a 50-nt poly(A) tail (3 0 CO2-A 50 , lanes 10-12). The products were separated on a 5% urea polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. membrane potential ( Figure 5B). Finally, we analyzed steady-state levels of respiratory chain subunits, as OXPHOS dysfunction is usually associated with aberrant assembly or instability of mitochondrial respiratory complexes. PDE12 overexpression for 4 or 6 days markedly reduced the abundance of components of complex I and subunits of complex IV ( Figure 5C). The observed perturbations in the respiratory complexes in PDE12 overexpressing cells were additionally reflected by cellular oxygen consumption rates (OCR) that were reduced by $50% of the level of controls ( Figure 5D). The above results suggest that overexpression of PDE12 causes a severe defect in oxidative metabolism.",

            "text": "In order to determine whether the OXPHOS defect in cells overexpressing PDE12 is a consequence of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis, we labelled the de novo synthesized mitochondrially encoded subunits of the electron transport chain with radioactive methionine. After the inhibition of cytosolic translation, the incorporation of 35  of 35 S-Met was $15% of those in uninduced cells ( Figure 6B). Overexpression of the E351A mutant did not have any appreciable effect upon mitochondrial protein synthesis ( Figure 6B). Next, we carried out gradient sedimentation analyses of cell extracts from cells overexpressing PDE12 for 4 days and control cells in order to investigate the integrity of the mitochondrial ribosome ( Figure 6C). In this method, we detected the 28 S (small) and 39 S (large) subunits by western blotting of gradient fractions. We used DAP3/MRPS29 as a marker for the 28 S ribosomal subunit and MRPL3 as a marker for the 39 S subunit. The analyses of sedimentation of mitoribosomal subunits upon overexpression of PDE12 revealed: (i) deficiency of assembled 28 S mitoribosomal subunits as compared to the control and (ii) anomalous sedimentation of the 39 S subunits that was shifted towards slower migrating species ( Figure 6C). These changes in mitoribosomes were not due to any alteration in the length of the mitochondrial rRNAs, based on RNase protection assays of 12 S and 16 S rRNA (Supplementary Figure S4A-B). Nor was the steady-state level or length of 7 mt-tRNAs (Ser-UCN, Leu-UUR, Thr, Gln, Pro, Lys and Phe) affected by elevated PDE12 expression ( Supplementary Figure S4C-D). However, in the case of tRNASer-AGY the steady-state level of the full-length molecule was $60% of the control value after 4 days of PDE12 overexpression and a species of lower molecular mass was detected. A similar truncated form of tRNASer-AGY, albeit of much lower abundance, was observed in control cells (Supplementary Figure S4C). Mutant tRNA levels considerably >50% are needed to produce a mitochondrial translation defect (24) and so the observed inhibition of mitochondrial translation is most likely attributable to the shortening of the mt-RNA poly(A) tails, owing to mitochondrial ribosome instability and/or impaired assembly.

However, hPNPase has been localized to the mitochondrial inter-membrane space, rather than the matrix where mt-RNA resides, and a role in processing of mitochondrial transcripts has been suggested, most likely by indirect means (15,25).

            "text": "In the present study, we show that human PDE12 degrades poly(A) tails in vitro and that elevated expression of PDE12 results in shortening of poly(A) tails of certain mt-mRNAs in human cultured cells. The previous classification of PDE12 (2 0 -PDE) as an EEP-type deadenylase by Goldstrohm and Wickens (16) was circumstantial; PDE12 was reported to cleave phosphodiester bonds in short oligo(A) substrates when the 5 0 -phosphates of each adenosine are covalently linked between either the 2 0 -or 3 0 -hydroxyl positions (19). Until recently, the only suggested biological role of PDE12 has been the degradation of 2 0 -5 0 -linked oligo(A) in the RNase L innate immune response system and its cellular localization had not been studied (19). While our manuscript was in preparation, Poulsen et al. (22) reported the mitochondrial localization of PDE12 and confirmed that recombinant PDE12 produced in Escherichia coli is capable of degrading 3 0 -5 0 -linked RNA. Relatively short RNA substrates were used containing either (i) a 20-residue generic unstructured RNA sequence followed by 10 adenosine or cytosine residues or (ii) an RNA consisting of an 8 bp strong stem-loop structure followed by 10 adenosine residues. Longer incubation of the recombinant enzyme that lacked the predicted MTS with all three RNA substrates resulted in degradation into small fragments of 4-11 nt in size with comparable efficiency for all three substrates (22). In contrast, our studies of the biochemical properties of PDE12 isolated from human mitochondria show that PDE12 efficiently degrades poly(A) and poly(U), whereas poly(C) and poly(G) are not preferred substrates. Thus, PDE12 shares the same preference for poly(A) or poly(U) substrates as cytoplasmic deadenylases, such as PARN (26) and POP2 (27). Furthermore, we found that PDE12 isolated from mitochondria exhibits strong specificity to poly(A) when relatively long substrates containing a fragment of endogenous human mitochondrial sequence (over 100 nt of the 3 0 -end of ND1 or CO2) and poly(A) tails of 50 nt (close to the physiological length of the tails in mt-mRNAs) were used. The enzyme degraded maximally eight residues beyond the mRNA-poly(A) tail boundary. Eight nucleotides was also the maximum number of bases removed beyond the poly(A) tail of mt-mRNAs isolated from cells overexpressing PDE12. Therefore, human PDE12 has characteristics typical of a number of deadenylases: PARN, CCR4 and CAF1 (23,28). Moreover, as no RNA was truncated beyond the \u00c08 position, PDE12 is not likely to be responsible for a general mt-RNA decay, as previously suggested (22). The discrepancy between the activity of PDE12 on RNA reported by Poulsen et al. (22) and in the current study could be owing to: (i) the molar ratio of the enzyme to RNA (100:1 and 1.7:1, respectively); (ii) the source of the purified enzyme (E. coli and human mitochondria, respectively); or (iii) the use of RNA substrates containing arbitrary rather then natural mitochondrial sequences (see above).",

It is possible, however, that an alternatively localized form of the enzyme exists, which is involved in the regulation of the RNaseL pathway, as suggested previously (22). Of note, degradation of both 2 0 -5 0 -and 3 0 -5 0 -linked oligoriboadenylates has been reported previously for other poly(A)-specific exoribonucleases (31,32) and might therefore represent a common property of this class of enzyme.",

            "text": "Polyadenylation plays an important role in regulating mRNA stability in many systems [see 'Introduction' section and ref. 7]. The role of mitochondrial poly(A) tails in controlling the stability of mRNA has been debated. Different approaches have been undertaken to address this issue in human mitochondria: (i) prevention of the synthesis of mitochondrial poly(A) by depleting hmtPAP levels with siRNA (3,4,10) or (ii) trimming poly(A) tails by targeting the cytosolic poly(A)-specific nuclease PARN to mitochondria (12). Independent studies of hmtPAP gene silencing reached quite different conclusions as shortening of poly(A) tails did not affect the stability of the analysed mitochondrial transcripts (ND3, CO3 and ATP6/8) in one study (3), whereas others found that the abundance of several mitochondrial transcripts decreased in response to hmtPAP siRNA (4,10). It should be stressed, however, that siRNAinduced downregulation of hmtPAP might not have been complete and also the existence of a second polyadenylating enzyme has been postulated (33,34) that would additionally complicate the interpretation of the results of the downregulation of hmtPAP by siRNA. On the other hand, mitochondrial targeting of PARN completely removed the 3 0 -poly(A) extensions of mt-RNAs (12). This had a variable effect on mt-mRNA steady-state levels, increasing some (ND1, ND2 and ND5) and decreasing others (CO1, CO2 and ATP6/8), whilst still others were little changed (ND4/4 L and ND3). Deadenylation of mitochondrial transcripts as a result of overexpression of PDE12 had a very similar effect on the steady-state levels of the above transcripts ( Figure 4D). Thus, in both studies removing poly(A) tails from mt-mRNAs destabilized CO1 and CO2, whereas poly(A) addition promotes turnover of ND1 and ND2 mRNAs in human mitochondria, as previously proposed (15,33). Therefore, there is no universal role of mitochondrial poly(A) tails in regulation of the RNA stability, and two classes of poly(A) tails might exist in mitochondria that have opposite regulatory functions i.e. either stabilization or destabilization. If stable and degradation inducing poly(A) tails exist in mitochondria, how do animal mitochondria differentiate between them? Our data show that the efficiency of degrading of the poly(A) tails by PDE12 in vitro is different for certain transcripts, e.g. PDE12 deadenylates ND1 more efficiently than CO2 in vitro ( Figure 3C), and in cells ( Figure 4B). This might suggest the presence of RNA 3 0 -end cis-regulatory elements that modulate the deadenylating activity of PDE12. Perhaps, the structure of the 3 0 -end of the CO2 mRNA partially protects the transcript from deadenylation, which is particularly intriguing in light of the fact that the CO2 messenger becomes unstable upon removal of the poly(A) tail. In summary, our data confirm a previous suggestion (6,35) that polyadenylation itself is not sufficient to direct mt-RNA for degradation or to stabilise mitochondrial transcripts and that the regulation of RNA turnover must depend on additional, yet to be identified, factors.",

            "text": "Our data show that PDE12 is important for regulating translation efficiency in human mitochondria. The overexpression of PDE12 resulted in decreased translation rates for all mitochondrial proteins ( Figure 6) despite the fact that the steady-state levels of the majority of transcripts were not changed or were up-regulated ( Figure 4D). There was an $50% reduction in the steady-state levels of only two transcripts-CO1 and CO2. However, it is unlikely that the down-regulation of these individual transcripts could have caused the general inhibition of mitochondrial translation, as published data indicates that a comparable reduction in the steady-state levels of two or more human mitochondrial transcripts does not lead to a global translational defect affecting all mtDNA-encoded proteins (36). The effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis is likely to result from the removal of poly(A) tails by the exoribonucleolytic activity of PDE12, rather then from a direct interaction of the enzyme with the mitochondrial translation machinery (e.g. ribosomes or translation factors) or from an indirect effect related to a defect in cell growth. This is supported by the lack of co-sedimentation of PDE12 with mitoribosomes in sucrose gradient experiments or the lack of interaction with mitoribosomal proteins in pull-down experiments (data not shown). Also, conditions that increase cells' reliance on mitochondrial ATP production exacerbated the observed growth phenotype ( Figure 5A). No alterations were observed in the abundance of components of complex II (containing only nuclearly encoded and cytoplasmically translated subunits) nor other cytoplasmic proteins (b-actin or GAPDH) suggesting a specifically mitochondrial, rather than cytoplasmic, effect in cells overexpressing PDE12. Here, again our findings are concordant with another study in which mt-mRNA poly(A) tails were removed by mitochondrial targeting of the cytosolic deadenylase PARN or coated by mitochondrially targeted human cytosolic poly(A)binding protein, PABPC1 (12), both of which resulted in marked inhibition of mitochondrial translation.",

This is in agreement with the observation that the 3 0 -termini of mt-rRNAs normally do not have >1-2 nt adenine nucleotides (3) and therefore might not present good substrates for PDE12 deadenylation. Also, we did not observe a marked change in the steady-state levels of the majority of mt-tRNAs analysed. Only tRNA-SerAGY-the unusual mt-tRNA, which does not fold into cloverleaf structure (37)-was downregulated by $40% and a shorter species was observed for this mt-tRNA. This change is unlikely to account for the dramatic (almost 90%) translation inhibition observed after PDE12 overexpression. As the truncated product of tRNASer-AGY was also observed in control cells, it might represent a relatively stable decay intermediate, which is more abundant in cells with inhibited mitochondrial translation, rather then a PDE12 degradation product."

Nuclear-encoded eukaryotic transcripts are polyadenylated by the nuclear polyadenylation machinery. Once the mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm, poly(A) not only stabilize RNA, but also promotes translation initiation. Eukaryotic cytoplasmic initiation factors recognize the 5 0 -mRNA m 7 G cap structure and the 3 0 -poly(A) tail via poly(A)-binding protein leading to circularization of the mRNA, which is necessary for translation initiation (38). The architecture of the mitochondrial translation initiation machinery resembles the one found in bacteria (8), and both bacterial and mitochondrial mt-mRNAs lack the 5 0 -end cap structure. However, mature bacterial messengers do not contain poly(A) tails as polyadenylation consistently promotes mRNA degradation in prokaryotes. If, by analogy to Eukaryota, mitochondrial poly(A) tails play a role in translation initiation their removal might primarily affect the stability of the 28 S small ribosomal subunit as this subunit binds mRNA prior to assembly of the 55 S mitoribosome (39).",

            "text": "The exonucleolytic activity of PDE12 can extend several nucleotides beyond the processing/polyadenylation site ( Figures 3C and 4B). This observation brings about an alternative explanation of how polyadenylation could influence mitochondrial translation. For 7 of 13 mitochondrial ORFs (ND1, ND2 ND3, ND4, CytB, CO3 and ATP6) removal of several terminal ribonucleotides (e.g. eight as seen for the ND1 mRNA) would result in truncation of a translation stop codon and at least two protein-coding triplets. This might be sufficient to inhibit translation owing to mitoribosome stalling. Studies of bacterial and eukaryotic systems have identified several mechanisms of regulatory stalling of ribosomes that inhibits protein synthesis (40,41). However, the remaining six mitochondrial transcripts, ND4L, ND5, ND6, CO1, CO2 and ATP8, contain 3 0 -UTRs prior to poly(A) extension that are long enough to ensure the presence of an entire ORF, even after the removal of 8 nt. Nonetheless, notably lowered steady-state levels of deadenylated mRNAs-encoding CO1, CO2 and ATP6/8 were observed in our experiments ( Figure 4C) and have been reported previously by others (4,10,12). Therefore, the deadenylation-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial translation could depend on two simultaneous events: removal of the last 2-3 codons from the 3 0 -ends causing ribosome stalling and destabilization of mRNAs containing 3 0 -UTRs.",

(A) Products of mitochondrial translation were labelled with35 S 36methionine for 15 min after expression of PDE12 or the E351A catalytic mutant in HEK293T cells for 2 or 4 days as described in 'Materials and Methods' section. Mitochondrial proteins were separated by a 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To validate equal protein loading, a small section of the gel was stained with Coomassie. (B) Radiolabelled products of mitochondrial translation as in (A) were quantified using ImageQuant software following exposure to a PhosphorImager cassette. ***P < 0.001; two-tailed Student's t-test; n = 4, Error bars = 1 SD. (C) Mitochondrial ribosome profile in cells overexpressing PDE12. Cell lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing PDE12 for 4 days or control cells were separated on a 10-30% (v:v) isokinetic sucrose gradient. Fractions obtained for control and PDE12 overexpressing cells were analysed by western blot simultaneously with antibodies to MRPL3 (39 S mitoribosomal subunit) and DAP3 (28 S mitoribosomal subunit).",
