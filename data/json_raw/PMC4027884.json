            "text": "A massive amount of radioactive materials has been released into the environment by the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, but its biological impacts have rarely been examined. Here, we have quantitatively evaluated the relationship between the dose of ingested radioactive cesium and mortality and abnormality rates using the pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha. When larvae from Okinawa, which is likely the least polluted locality in Japan, were fed leaves collected from polluted localities, mortality and abnormality rates increased sharply at low doses in response to the ingested cesium dose. This dose-response relationship was best fitted by power function models, which indicated that the half lethal and abnormal doses were 1.9 and 0.76 Bq per larva, corresponding to 54,000 and 22,000 Bq per kilogram body weight, respectively. Both the retention of radioactive cesium in a pupa relative to the ingested dose throughout the larval stage and the accumulation of radioactive cesium in a pupa relative to the activity concentration in a diet were highest at the lowest level of cesium ingested. We conclude that the risk of ingesting a polluted diet is realistic, at least for this butterfly, and likely for certain other organisms living in the polluted area. E nvironmental pollution by artificial radionuclides released from the collapsed Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has often been evaluated based on radioactivity concentrations in environmental samples collected from the polluted area, such as soil and forest litter 1-3. The accumulation of radionuclides in the bodies of wild and domesticated organisms and in agricultural products has also been documented 4-11. However, the biological impacts of this pollution on the health and disease of wild organisms have not been examined sufficiently. A field study indicated that the abundance of insects, especially butterflies, has decreased 12,13 , suggesting that the pollution might have had a fatal effect on butterflies. Another study indicated a high incidence of morphological abnormality in gall-forming aphids 14. Consistent with these studies, we have demonstrated that the Japanese pale grass blue butterfly, Zizeeria maha (Yamato shijimi in Japanese), was affected physiologically and genetically in the polluted area, likely due to the artificial radionuclides released from the Fukushima Daiichi NPP 15,16. In one of a series of experiments, we have shown a decrease in the survival rate of this butterfly in accordance with the level of radioactivity of cesium in the diet (i.e., the leaves of the host plant, Oxalis corniculata) 15,16 under our standard rearing conditions 17. In this experiment, host plant leaves were collected from 5 different localities with different pollution levels (Ube, Hirono, Fukushima, Iitate-flatland, and Iitate-montane) (Table 1) and were given to larvae that were obtained in the laboratory from field-caught females from Okinawa 15 , which is likely the least polluted locality in Japan. However, the amount of food and the dose of artificial radioactive cesium ingested by these larvae remain to be determined. Furthermore, the amount of radioactivity retained and accumulated by pupae has not been examined. In the present study, we quantified the amount of radioactive cesium consumed by larvae over their lifetimes. Based on these data, simple mathematical models were employed to obtain the radioactive cesium doses resulting in a 50% mortality rate and a 50% abnormality rate. We also quantified how much radioactive cesium was retained and accumulated in pupae. Finally, we discussed the possible risks of a polluted diet for butterflies and other organisms living in the polluted area. Results Quantification of ingested doses. We first investigated the leaf weight consumed by larvae in the larval stage (Fig. 1). Dietary consumption curves for 5 larvae were largely sigmoidal: approximately 4 days before reaching the",

There was variability in the total amount ingested among the 5 individuals; we recorded 0.304, 0.342, 0.391, 0.318, and 0.279 g (mean 6 SD 5 0.327 6 0.038 g; n 5 5) for the total weight of host plant leaves eaten by each larva (Fig. 1). However, the shapes of these dietary consumption curves were essentially similar to one another, indicating that our feeding process in which we quantified the weight of ingested leaves did not considerably disrupt the overall growth patterns of the larvae. Within 24 hours after pupation, the weights of all 5 pupae were also recorded; we recorded 0.023, 0.028, 0.033, 0.035, and 0.026 g pupal weight (mean 6 SD 5 0.029 6 0.004 g; n 5 5). These 5 pupae were smaller than other pupae reared under standard conditions using leaves from Ube, a control locality (mean 6 SD 5 0.035 6 0.005 g; n 5 154). This difference is most likely due to larval stress resulting from the above rearing conditions, which were necessary to quantify the ingested leaves. Only one piece of leaf was given at a time and replaced daily, and each larva was confined to a small airtight container (see Methods). The leaf weight ingested by an average larva reared under the standard conditions was calculated to be 0.389 g per larva based on a linear adjustment according to the mean pupal weight under the standard conditions, 0.035 g.",

In reference to mortality rates and abnormality rates of 5 groups that ingested leaves from Ube (n 5 154), Hirono (n 5 85), Fukushima (n 5 108), Iitate-flatland (n 5 100), and Iitate-montane (n 5 103) (Table 1), we next examined possible relationships between the dose of ingested cesium per larva and the mortality and abnormality rates (Fig. 2). Both the mortality and abnormality rates increased sharply, especially at low doses, until the ingested cesium dose reached approximately 3 Bq, above which rates did not change notably. Because the plot for the Iitate-montane group was located in the plateau phase, we tentatively excluded it to obtain a mathematical model. Indeed, inclusion of the Iitate-montane plot made any models examined less fit (data not shown). The remaining plots were approximated very well using power functions: y 5 42x 0. 28  , and p , 0.0001 for the abnormality rate. The power functions above were compared with simple linear models. For the mortality rate, we obtained y 5 16x 1 13 with R 2 5 0.9236, RMSE 5 9.1, F 5 24, and p 5 0.039, using the 4 data points excluding the Iitate-montane data. For the abnormality rate, we obtained y 5 18x 1 20 with R 2 5 0.8527, RMSE 5 15, F 5 12, and p 5 0.077, using the 4 data points. These results indicate that the simple linear models were poorer fits than the power function models. Similarly, we examined logarithmic models, obtaining y 5 5.9 ln(x) 1 49 with R 2 5 0.8806, RMSE 5 11, F 5 15, and p 5 0.062 for the mortality rate, and y 5 7.3 ln(x) 1 61 with R 2 5 0.9420, RMSE 5 9.5, F 5 33, and p 5 0.029 for the abnormality rate. These logarithmic models appeared to be better than the linear models but still inferior to the power function models. We examined other major models, all of which were less fit than the power function models (see Methods).",

We measured the amount of cesium radioactivity retained in pupae, which could affect metamorphosis, resulting in morphological abnormalities and death 16 .

Rather, the mortality and abnormality rates increased sharply, especially at low doses. Additionally, there seemed to be no threshold level below which no biological response could be detected. These results are consistent with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model, which is relatively widely accepted at low doses 18,19 , in that there was no threshold detected in our system. However, the results may be inconsistent with the LNT model in that a linear model may not be appropriate for our system. More precisely, the power function fit for the dose-response data suggests that the relatively small level of artificial cesium from the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP may be significantly toxic to some individuals in butterfly populations, although we do not know whether the relatively ''low-level'' radiation in our experimental system is in the range of the levels safely applicable to the LNT model. Nevertheless, we assert that the half lethal and abnormal doses we obtained were quite high. Moreover, the critical concentrations of cesium resulting in the half lethal and abnormal doses, 4.9 (60.05) 3 10 3 and 2.0 (60.05) 3 10 3 Bq per kilogram leaf, respectively, appeared to be very high compared to naturally occurring radioactivity levels. These results can be interpreted to suggest that the pale grass blue butterfly is generally resistant to internal radiation exposure. The possible biological impacts of much lower radiation levels will be the subject of future investigations.",

            "text": "The relevance of our results to humans remains undetermined and will remain so because of the impossibility of controlled experiments in humans. However, it should be noted that we sampled contaminated leaves from Fukushima City, which many people inhabit as though nothing had happened, and from Hirono Town, which some people returned to inhabit. Moreover, our results are consistent with the previous human results after the Chernobyl accident, in which infant mortality rate increased sharply in West Germany 20 and in the United States 21 . Gould and Sternglass (1989)  21 speculated that the increased infant mortality rate immediately after the Chernobyl accident may have been caused by the ingestion of radioactive iodine. Although they used a logarithmic model rather than a power function model to fit their dose-response relationship, both models share a sharp non-linear increase at low doses. Implications of the half lethal and abnormal doses we obtained in the present study will impact future discussions on the effects of radioactive exposure on other organisms, including humans.",

            "text": "We found that cesium radioactivity in Hirono pupae was relatively high, despite Hirono leaves having the lowest level of contamination among those examined. Interestingly, cesium activity in the Iitate-  www.nature.com/scientificreports montane pupae was the lowest observed, except for the control Ube pupae, despite consuming leaves with the highest level of contamination observed. The Hirono pupae, which ate leaves with relatively low-level contamination among those sampled, had the highest retention and accumulation values. One possibility is that the epithelial cells of the digestive tract of larvae that ate the highly contaminated Iitate-montane leaves became damaged, preventing the absorption of radioactive cesium. Alternatively, the digestive tract may have effectively expelled the excessively high dose of cesium, resulting in the absorption of a limited amount. The latter possibility is more likely, as no systematic reduction of body weight or wing size, which might result from digestive tract damage, was observed in the Iitate-montane group 15 . Indeed, the latter possibility may be likely if cesium was ingested as microparticles 22 adsorbed onto the surface of host plant leaves. In contrast to the Iitate-montane group, the larvae that ate Hirono leaves appeared to have effectively absorbed the radioactive cesium. This scenario explains not only the sharp increase of the mortality and abnormality rates at low doses but also the saturated mortality and abnormality rates at high doses. The saturation of the mortality and abnormality rates may also be explained by a possible exhaustion of relevant targets such as functional genes that cause immediate lethal or abnormal effects when damaged. Such genes may be limited in number, and further hits at these genes do not contribute to an increase in the mortality and abnormality rates. The biological impacts of internal radiation exposure on larvae may be relatively high, considering the fact that the artificial cesium emits not only c-rays but b-rays 23 . Additionally, the radioactive plume may have been ingested as microparticles 22 , causing immune responses (or other physiological responses) independent of radiation, eventually leading to pathological outcomes. There is also the possibility that other radioactive (and even non-radioactive) materials from the Fukushima Dai-ichi NPP, other than cesium, could contribute additively to butterfly mortality and abnormality.",

We speculate that sensitivity likely varies widely under different genetic and environmental conditions, even within a single species. In this internal exposure experiment, we observed that even under the dosage conditions where many individuals died, other individuals survived normally. That is, the mortality and abnormality rates never reached 100%, indicating individual variability of sensitivity within a species. Because such intraspecies variation likely exists in humans as well as in other organisms, setting a single threshold for a ''safe exposure level'' requires clearly stated confidence intervals along with other relevant information on the system of interest.",

This well-type detector provides maximum efficiency for small samples, because samples can be inserted into a well. Before measurement, dead pupae were air-dried for several months and placed in a columnar plastic container (14 mm in diameter). The detector was calibrated with a standard prepared from the NBL powder standard (New Brunswick Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne, IL, USA).
