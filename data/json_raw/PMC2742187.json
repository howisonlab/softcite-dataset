            "text": "The evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR), a central effector of cell growth, controls diverse metabolic outputs, including protein translation, mRNA transcription, cytoskeletal organization, autophagy, and cell death (Wullschleger et al., 2006). Although most of the research on TOR has focused on its growth-promoting activity, hyperactive TOR signaling can also enhance the induction of cell death by various signals (Shah et al., 2004;Ghosh et al., 2006), and inhibition of TOR signaling can protect cells against proapoptotic insults (Ravikumar et al., 2006). The mechanisms underlying the relationship between TOR signaling and cell death are largely unknown, but the induction of autophagy that occurs when TOR activity is suppressed has been proposed to alleviate cellular toxicity in several neurodegenerative disease models (Rubinsztein et al., 2007;Mizushima et al., 2008).",

            "text": "The prosurvival function of autophagy might have a protective role against the development of several diseases, most notably neurodegenerative diseases involving formation of intracellular aggregates (Rubinsztein et al., 2007). Many pathogenic aggregate-prone proteins, including polyglutamine (polyQ)expanded huntingtin are strongly dependent on autophagy for their degradation (Ravikumar et al., 2002;Berger et al., 2006;Shibata et al., 2006), and rapamycin attenuates accumulation of mutated huntingtin proteins and cell death in Huntington's disease (HD) models (Ravikumar et al., 2004;Shibata et al., 2006). These findings have led to the proposition that autophagy induction might be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as HD (Ravikumar et al., 2002). However, it has not T arget of rapamycin (TOR) signaling is a regulator of cell growth. TOR activity can also enhance cell death, and the TOR inhibitor rapamycin protects cells against proapoptotic stimuli. Autophagy, which can protect against cell death, is negatively regulated by TOR, and disruption of autophagy by mutation of Atg5 or Atg7 can lead to neurodegeneration. However, the implied functional connection between TOR signaling, autophagy, and cell death or degeneration has not been rigorously tested. Using the Drosophila melanogaster visual system, we show in this study that hyper-activation of TOR leads to photoreceptor cell death in an age-and light-dependent manner and that this is because of TOR's ability to suppress autophagy. We also find that genetically inhibiting TOR or inducing autophagy suppresses cell death in Drosophila models of Huntington's disease and phospholipase C (norpA)mediated retinal degeneration. Thus, our data indicate that TOR induces cell death by suppressing autophagy and provide direct genetic evidence that autophagy alleviates cell death in several common types of neurodegenerative disease.",

Therefore, we considered the possibility that TOR might affect retinal degeneration by inducing cellular overgrowth, as promoted by S6K and 4EBP. Both GMR>rheb flies and tsc1 29 mosaic flies had hypertrophic eyes (Fig. S1). To reduce this hypertrophy, we used UAS-rheb/+;ninaE-Gal4/+ (ninaE>rheb) flies, which only expressed Rheb in adult R1-R6 photoreceptors. The eyes of ninaE>rheb flies were similar in size to controls ( Fig. S1) and had normal retinal morphology when the flies were young (<2 d old; Fig. 2 A). However, few R1-R6 rhabdomeres were detected in light-exposed 30-d-old ninaE>rheb flies, although R7 rhabdomeres were generally present (Fig. 2, B and F). To further test the idea that cell overgrowth might be responsible for neuronal degeneration in the presence of excess TOR activity, we examined the ommatidial morphology of both GMR-Gal4/UAS-s6k TE (GMR>s6k) flies, which overexpress constitutively active S6K, and thor 2 flies, which are mutant for 4EBP (Teleman et al., 2005). After 30 d of light/dark cycling, photoreceptors were preserved normally in both the GMR>s6k flies and the thor 2 flies (Fig. 2, C, D, and F). This indicates that Rheb-induced photoreceptor cell death occurs independently of S6K and 4EBP and is most likely not a consequence of increased cell growth.",

The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) gene products Tsc1 and Tsc2 form a GTPaseactivating protein that suppresses Rheb activity and thereby negatively regulates TOR kinase activity (Wullschleger et al., 2006). Therefore, to activate the TOR pathway, we overexpressed Rheb in Drosophila compound eyes using the Gal4/ upstream activator sequence (UAS) system. Using the transgene combination UAS-rheb and glass multiple reporter (GMR)-Gal4 (an eye-specific Gal4 driver), we selectively overexpressed Rheb in photoreceptor neurons. The Drosophila compound eye consists of \ue07a800 repetitive units, known as ommatidia, each of which includes seven photoreceptor cells in any given plane of a tangential section. Each photoreceptor cell contains a microvillar structure, the rhabdomere, which is the photoreception organelle and is centrally located in the ommatidium (Fig. 1 A, R). Control retinas (GMR-Gal4/+) had all seven photoreceptor cells in each ommatidium regardless of their age or whether or not they were maintained in the light or dark (Fig. 1, A and G). Young GMR-Gal4 UAS-rheb/+ (GMR>rheb) flies had normal eye morphology, although the ommatidium size was much larger than in controls (Fig. S1). However, GMR>rheb flies underwent an age-dependent loss of photoreceptor cells when cultured on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (Fig. 1, B, C, and G). Interestingly, GMR>rheb flies cultured in continuous darkness lost photoreceptor cells more slowly than those exposed to light (Fig. 1, D and G), indicating that photoreceptor degeneration in the Rheb-overexpressing eyes was dependent on phototransduction.",

Using the ey-Gal4 UAS-FLP/hid system (Stowers and Schwarz, autophagy in the eye by overexpression of Atg1 did not suppress TOR activity.

Thus, these results show that enforced autophagy can suppress TOR-dependent neural degeneration, strongly supporting the idea that TORinduced neuronal cell death is a consequence of the inhibition of autophagy. (Scott et al., 2007), we generated transgenic flies expressing tagged Atg1 under the control of the ninaE promoter (ninaE-atg1). In ninaE-atg1 flies, high levels of Atg1-MYC protein were detected in the head, and autophagy, as assayed by LysoTracker staining, was strongly increased in photoreceptor cell bodies (Fig. S2). Although it has been hypothesized that autophagy can down-regulate TOR (Lee et al., 2007), we observed that S6K phosphorylation was not affected by the ninaE-atg1 transgene (Fig. S2), implying that induction of induction of autophagy by overexpressed ATG1 (ninaE-atg1) also suppressed photoreceptor cell death in the HQ120 flies (Fig. 4, A and D). These results support the idea that inducing autophagy by inhibiting TOR can suppress neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregates such as HD.",

One such condition is HD, a devastating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by polyQ-expanded huntingtin protein. In animal models of HD, the TOR inhibitor rapamycin can attenuate cell death (Ravikumar et al., 2004), and mutations in autophagy genes can enhance polyQ aggregation and neurodegeneration (Jia et al., 2007). However, whether the effects of TOR on polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration are caused by its regulation of autophagy has not been directly or genetically tested. On the contrary, one recent study using the Drosophila eye implicated S6K and PDK1 rather than autophagy as enhancers of polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration (Nelson et al., 2005). To explore the role of TOR-dependent autophagy in HD, we expressed N-terminal fragments of human huntingtin that contain 120 glutamine residues in photoreceptor neurons (Jackson et al., 1998). The GMR-htt.Q120 flies (HQ120) manifested strong age-dependent loss of rhabdomeres and photoreceptor cells in an optical neutralization assay and by EM (Fig. 4, A and B). Inhibition of TOR by overexpression of TSC1 and TSC2 (GMR>Tsc1/2) largely suppressed neural degeneration caused by HQ120 (Fig. 4, A-C). Furthermore, direct rhodopsin-arrestin complexes (Alloway et al., 2000). Neuronal degeneration in the norpA model cannot be suppressed by the inhibitors of apoptosis and thus seems not to be mediated by apoptosis (Hsu et al., 2004). We found that norpA P24 mutants underwent rapid retinal degeneration, such that the animals had detectable loss of photoreceptors cells by 4 d and were almost devoid of photoreceptor cells by day 10 (Fig. 5, A and B). The norpA-mediated degeneration was significantly suppressed by overexpression of either TSC1 and TSC2 or Atg1 in photoreceptor cells (Fig. 5, A, C, and D). Thus, the suppression of autophagy by TOR activity is a critical component in norpAmediated neurodegeneration.",

To test this, we assayed the percentage of major arrestin (Arr2) bound to rhodopsin using a coprecipitation assay. We found that exposure to light for 1 h caused \ue07a45% of the Arr2 to bind to rhodopsin in wild-type eyes, whereas >60% was bound in norpA mutants (Fig. 5, E and F). However, in both norpA P24 ;ninaE-atg1 and norpA P24 ;GMR>Tsc1/2 flies, the fraction of rhodopsin-bound Arr2 was decreased back nearly to the wild-type level without changing the overall rhodopsin/Arr2 ratio (Fig. 5, E and F). These data illustrate that autophagy can help eliminate rhodopsin-arrestin complexes and thus reduce their toxicity in the norpA model of retinal degeneration.",

Importantly, we found that the direct induction of autophagy by overexpression of Atg1 largely suppressed Rheb-induced photoreceptor cell death as well as photoreceptor neural degeneration in Drosophila models of HD and phospholipase C deletion. Our results support the idea that the continuous clearance of cytosolic components through autophagy is important for preventing the accumulation of toxic proteins that would otherwise disrupt neural function and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration.",

Moreover, recent studies have suggested that the TOR inhibitor rapamycin can attenuate cell death in several intracytosolic proteinopathies and that this might occur through the up-regulation of autophagy (Ravikumar et al., 2004;Berger et al., 2006). Thus, our genetic demonstration that suppression of TOR or activation of autophagy can cell-autonomously suppress neurodegeneration in a polyQ aggregation model provides direct genetic evidence to support this prevailing view of neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, heat shock proteins such as Hsp70 and Hsp40, which function as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation, as well as several components of the ubiquitin proteasome can suppress polyQ-induced degeneration (Warrick et al., 1999;Fernandez-Funez et al., 2000;Kazemi-Esfarjani and Benzer, 2000). Like autophagy, both pathways have key roles in protein quality control, emphasizing the significant that arise via unchecked cell growth are commonly believed to be the principal adverse effect in TSC disease, cell death has been detected inside these tumors (Maldonado et al., 2003;Zeng et al., 2007). Thus, an alternative explanation for some of the symptoms of TSC such as seizures is that they arise as a consequence of neural cell death and neurodegeneration.",

Thus, one outstanding question was whether TOR signaling and autophagy could modulate the cellular toxicity of unaggregated proteins. The toxic rhodopsin-arrestin complexes that form as a result of phototransduction, promoting retinal degeneration in norpA mutants, provided a good test case because rhodopsin-arrestin complexes are not detected in aggregates. We found that either TOR-dependent or -independent autophagy could suppress the accumulation of rhodopsin-arrestin in norpA mutants and that either mode of autophagy activation could alleviate retinal degeneration. We believe that these data support a model in which autophagy can suppress neural degeneration by removing toxic soluble proteins as well as toxic protein aggregates. Therefore, therapy involving the inhibition of TOR or other means for inducing autophagy might be applied to neurological diseases rather generally.",
