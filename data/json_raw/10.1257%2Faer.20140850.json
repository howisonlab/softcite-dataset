Nevertheless, most indices (e.g., the h-index) are motivated by intuition and rules of thumb, resulting in undesirable conclusions. In contrast, five natural properties lead us to a unique new index, the Euclidean index, that avoids several shortcomings of the h-index and its successors. The Euclidean index is simply the Euclidean length of an individual's citation list. Two empirical tests suggest that the Euclidean index outperforms the h-index in practice. (JEL A14, C43) Citation indices attempt to provide useful information about a researcher's publication record by summarizing it with a single numerical score. They provide government agencies, departmental and university committees, administrators, faculty, and students with a simple and potentially informative tool for comparing one researcher to another, and are regularly used to inform critical decisions about funding, promotion, and tenure. With decisions of this magnitude on the line, one should approach the problem of developing a good index as systematically as possible. Doing so here, we are led to a unique new index. 1 This new index, called the Euclidean index, is simply the Euclidean length of an individual's citation list. Perhaps the best-known citation index beyond a total citation count is the h-index (Hirsch 2005). A scholar's h-index is the number, h, of his/her papers that each have at least h citations. By design, the h-index limits the effect of a small number of highly cited papers, a feature which, though well intentioned, can produce intuitively implausible rankings. For example, consider two researchers, one with 10 papers, each with 10 citations (h-index = 10) , and another with 8 papers, each with 100 (or even 1,000) citations (h-index = 8) .",

            "text": "Improvements to the h -index have been suggested. Consider, for example, the g -index (Egghe 2006a,b), which is the largest number g such that the total citation count of the g most cited papers is at least g 2 . The g -index is intended to correct for the insensitivity of the h -index to the number of citations received by the h most cited papers. Many other variations have been suggested since. Yet, like the h -index, they are ad hoc measures based almost entirely on intuition and rules of thumb with insufficient justification given for choosing them over the infinitely many other unchosen possibilities. But for a novel empirical approach to selecting among a new class of h -indices, see Ellison (2012Ellison ( , 2013. 2 To illustrate the difficulties that can arise when a systematic approach to choosing an index is not followed, let us consider the very practical and well-recognized problem of comparing the records of individuals in different fields or subfields. 3 There is compelling evidence to suggest that for such comparisons to be meaningful, one must rescale each individual's citation list by dividing each entry in it by the average number of citations in that individual's field. Indeed, Radicchi, Fortunato, and Castellano (2008) observe that while the distributions of citations vary widely across a variety of fields (from agricultural economics to nuclear physics), after rescaling by the average number of citations within a field, the distributions all become virtually identical (see Section III).",

But before a final decision is made, a second position as well as a new candidate, C, become available. Candidate C, however, is an industrial organization (IO) economist and so a rescaling of the citation lists is necessary to compare the three records across the two fields. But a serious difficulty arises. The rescaling has reversed the ranking of the two macroeconomists. That is, applying the h -index to the rescaled lists produces the ranking: B preferred to C preferred to A, and it is now entirely unclear which one of the two macroeconomists should be hired! But do such reversals occur in practice? According to data collected by Ellison (2013), 4 the average number of citations per paper among macroeconomists at the top 50 US universities is 98 , while among IO economists it is 55 . 5 That is, macroeconomists are cited 1.8 ( = 98/55 ) times more often per paper, on average, than IO economists. Applying the h -index to Ellison's (2013) data, both before and after reducing the macroeconomists' citations by a factor of 1.8, we find that 95 percent of them experience at least one pairwise ranking change with another macroeconomist 2 Ellison (2013) introduces the following class of generalized Hirsch indices. For any a, b > 0 and for any citation list, h (a, b) is the number of papers, h, that each have at least a h b citations. Ellison estimates a and b so that h (a, b) gives the best fit in terms of ranking economists at the top 50 US universities in a manner that is consistent with the observed labor market outcome. Ellison (2012) is a related paper that instead uses data on computer scientists.",

If a prediction is important to the decision at hand (as in tenure decisions, for example) then separate methods must first be used to obtain a predicted citation list to which our index can then be applied. 11 Finally, it should be noted that our index is ordinal. Indeed, we would argue that virtually all citation indices are ordinal because they do not provide decision makers (administrators, tenure committees, funding committees, etc.) with information such as individual A is \"worth twice as much\" as individual B. On the other hand, citation indices can and do provide usefully interpretable ordinal information such as \" A is equivalent to an individual who receives twice as many citations as B on every paper\" (see Section IIA). It is up to decision makers to apply this interpretable information to decide how much A should be paid relative to B, or how much teaching A should be assigned relative to B, or how much funding A should receive _ h , this adjustment too will lead to difficulties.

The list of citations is then operated upon by some index function to produce the individual's index number. As already mentioned in the introduction (see also Section III), one must sometimes rescale one individual's citation list to adequately compare it to another individual's list. Consequently, one must be prepared to consider noninteger lists. We therefore take as our domain the set L consisting of all finite nonincreasing sequences of nonnegative real numbers. Any element of L is called a citation list. 12 A citation index is any continuous function, \u03b9 : L \u2192 \u211d, that assigns to each citation list a real number. 13 Consider first the following four basic properties.

In this exercise we restricted attention to individuals in Ellison's (2013) data who are classified as working in a single field. For the 88 individuals who are classified as macroeconomists, the average number of citations per paper is 97.9, while the average number of citations per paper for the 64 IO economists is 55.17. Therefore, to adequately compare macroeconomists to IO economists one must scale down the macroeconomists' citation lists by a factor of (97.9)/(55.17) = 1.77.

Inspired by Ellison (2013), and again using his data, we tested each index to see how well its ranking of economists at the top 50 US universities matched the NRC's ranking of the departments in which they are employed. To do this, we first rescaled the citation lists of each economist by the average number of citations in his/her field (with economic history as the numeraire). We then assigned a score to each index as follows. Starting from a score of zero, we increased an index's score by 1 whenever its strict ranking of two economists agreed with the NRC's strict ranking of their departments and we decreased an index's score by 1 otherwise, ignoring all ties. Summing all the +1s and \u22121 s and then dividing by the total number of distinct pairs of economists yields the index's score, a number between \u2212 1 and +1 . That is, we computed Kendall's (1938) rank correlation coefficient (or \"tau coefficient\") between the ranking of economists according to each of the two indices' ( h -index and Euclidean index) and the NRC's ranking of their departments.  7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 39 41 43 45 47 49 51 53 55 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 79 81 83 85  The Euclidean index outscored the h -index in this test, producing a score of 0.1846 , over 14 percent higher than the h -index's score of 0.1614 . And both indices' rankings of economists reject (with a p-value of 0.4 percent for the Euclidean index and 2.6 percent for the h -index) the null hypothesis of mutual independence with the NRC's ranking. 24 In addition to testing the Euclidean index against the h -index, we tested the Euclidean index against a whole family of indices that nest the Euclidean index. Specifically, we computed Kendall's rank correlation coefficient between the ranking of economists given by the \" \u03c3 -index\"",

The family of \u03c3 -indices with \u03c3 > 1 is precisely the family of indices that satisfy properties (i)-(iv) (see the discussion following Theorem 1 in Section II).  Figure 4 the value of Kendall's coefficient achieved by the Euclidean index (dashed line) and the lower value achieved by the h -index (dotted line). As is evident from the figure, for all values of \u03c3 between 1 and 4, Kendall's coefficient for the \u03c3 -index is larger than that for the h -index. Moreover, Kendall's coefficient achieves its maximum value of 0.1849 when \u03c3 = 1.85, a value of \u03c3 that is remarkably close to the value of \u03c3 = 2 that defines the Euclidean index. Thus, the Euclidean index, in addition to outscoring the h -index, outscores a whole family of indices satisfying properties (i)-(iv), namely the family of \u03c3 -indices for values of \u03c3 > 1 that are not too close to 1.85 . 24 Under the null hypothesis of mutual independence between an index's ranking and the NRC's ranking, the scores are (see Kendall 1938) well approximated by a normal distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 2/(3 \u221a _ n ) = 0.071 , where n = 88 is the number of economists who are classified as working in the single field of macroeconomics. \u03b9(\u03bb) \u2265 \u03b9(1). Then \u03bb > 0 since \u03b9(1) > \u03b9(0) as shown above. Hence, we may apply scale invariance to \u03b9(\u03bb) \u2265 \u03b9(1) using the scaling factor \u03bb. Doing so k times gives \u03b9( \u03bb k+1 ) \u2265 \u03b9( \u03bb k ) \u2265 \u22ef \u2265 \u03b9(\u03bb) \u2265 \u03b9(1). Taking the limit as k \u2192 \u221e of \u03b9( \u03bb k+1 ) \u2265 \u03b9(1) implies, because \u03b9 is continuous and \u03bb < 1 , that \u03b9(0) \u2265 \u03b9(1). But this contradicts \u03b9(1) > \u03b9(0) and so establishes (A1). For any n \u2265 1, let \u03b9 n : \u211d + n \u2192 \u211d be the restriction of \u03b9 to \u211d + n . For any subset I of { 1, \u2026 , n} and for any x \u2208 \u211d + n let x I = ( x i ) i\u2208I and let I c = { 1, \u2026 , n}\\I.
