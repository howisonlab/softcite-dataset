Pour \u00e9tablir les facteurs importants pour le d\u00e9veloppement, en sant\u00e9 mentale, des soins offerts en partenariat par des intervenants de diverses disciplines, nous avons puis\u00e9 dans la litt\u00e9rature existante sur le sujet (travaux universitaires et rapports traitant de politiques publiques), et nous avons r\u00e9alis\u00e9 des entrevues en profondeur avec des personnes cl\u00e9s travaillant en m\u00e9decine familiale, en psychiatrie, en psychologie, en travail social et en soins infirmiers. The purpose of this research was (i) to describe the factors that affect collaboration among mental health service providers of different disciplines, (ii) to understand the mix of providers in existing collaborative care models, and (iii) to develop a framework to better understand the barriers and facilitators to interdisciplinary collaborative mental health delivery using Ontario as a case example. We draw upon the academic and policy literature and in-depth interviews with key informants from the disciplines of family medicine, psychiatry, psychology, social work, and nursing to identify factors that are important to the successful development of interdisciplinary collaborative mental health care.",

Long waits to see specialists and shortages of psychiatrists and family physicians (Goel et al. 1996;Pitblado and Pong 1999;Pare and Gilbert 2004) have placed pressure on practising family physicians, especially when treating more complex cases. Increasingly, family physicians have indicated their need for support from mental health professionals in mental health service delivery (Craven et al. 1997). In 1997, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the College of Family Physicians of Canada issued a joint paper stressing the need for improved communication between family physicians and psychiatrists entitled, \"Shared Mental Health Care in Canada.\" They challenged physicians and policymakers to facilitate the expansion of shared mental health care (Kates and Ackerman 2002).",

The First Minister's Accord on Health Care Renewal (Health Canada 2003) provided transitional funding for primary care renewal that led to a number of interdisciplinary collaborative mental health-care pilot projects. 2 More recently, the Kirby Commission recommended the creation of a Canadian Mental Health Commission to advance mental health reforms in Canada, including expansion of collaborative care (Kirby 2005). In Ontario, the government's ongoing Transformation Agenda (Ontario. Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care 2006) includes the development of interdisciplinary primary health-care delivery teams, which present an opportunity to integrate interdisciplinary mental health-care providers into developing Family Health Teams (FHTs) (Ontario.

Wherever possible, participants who had experience working in a variety of settings and who could comment from a number of perspectives were selected. Through snowball sampling, additional informants were added to complete the sampling matrix. 5 All interviews followed a semi-structured guide, were conducted by the first author by telephone, and took between 45 minutes and an hour and a half. The initial interview guide focused on how geography and economic issues identified in the literature (e.g., differences in insurance coverage, remuneration, and funding streams across disciplines) could act as barriers to collaboration. With each progressive interview, the guide was used more flexibly, because its open-ended nature enabled the respondents to identify numerous other factors that were also critical for interdisciplinary collaboration. The interviews were recorded on audiotape and transcribed by a professional transcriber who signed a confidentiality agreement. Ethics approval was obtained from the McMaster Research Ethics Board. Participants had an opportunity to review relevant portions of the analysis to ensure their accuracy.",

The richness of the diversity of factors raised by respondents and their concurrence about the importance of these factors prompted a return to the literature to further assess the salience of these issues.

Overlapping scopes of practice enabled through the RHPA can be seen as (i) enhancing the ability to establish collaborative care teams by allowing substitution of available local providers to perform certain activities, and (ii) potentially detracting from the quality of collaboration in the team by creating friction among team members over boundary issues (Hall 2005). Some may feel underutilized, others overutilized; either situation can lead to a tendency for providers to withdraw from full participation in the team (ibid.).",

With higher educational requirements and a different set of skills, such as psychological testing and research skills, psychologists are often paid more than social workers and nurses.

(KI 7) CONCLUDING COMMENTS A large number of interrelated factors, which operate at the global, local, and within-team levels, influence the development of collaborative mental health-care programs. These factors explain the limited number of programs to date in Ontario and the mix of particular disciplines (e.g., the limited role of psychology), within existing programs. We present a conceptual framework that helps to organize this wide array of factors that will be useful not only in helping direct future research, but also important in framing policy.",
