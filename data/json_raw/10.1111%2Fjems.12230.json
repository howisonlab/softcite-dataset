I consider a dynamic monopoly model with asymmetric information about product quality, in which consumers learn in equilibrium from both prices and other consumers. The main result is that word-of-mouth communication is essential for the existence of separating equilibria, wherein the high-quality monopolist signals high quality through a low introductory price (lower than the monopoly price), and the low-quality one charges the monopoly price. The intuition is simple: low prices are costly, and will only be used by firms confident enough that increased experimentation (and therefore communication among consumers) will yield good news about quality and increased future profits. Additional results are the following: for the high-quality seller, the expected price (quantity) is increasing (decreasing) over time; whereas for the low-quality one, the opposite is true. Moreover, signaling becomes more difficult when consumers pay less attention to their peers' reports and more attention to past prices. Finally, word-of-mouth communication improves consumer welfare."

            "text": "Word-of-mouth (WOM) communication is a powerful instrument to disseminate product information prior to purchase. When consumers face uncertainty about the quality of a new product, they are able to learn from their peers and, specifically, tend to pay attention to what their fellow consumers observed after their own purchases (Arndt, 1967;Chen & Xie, 2008;Zhu & Zhang, 2010). This information, communicated via WOM or eWOM, 1 is likely to be more credible, and therefore more persuasive than advertising or other seller-created information, because it is based on personal experience and usage (Bughin, Doogan, & Vetvik, 2010;Dellarocas, 2003;Mayzlin, 2006). As such, WOM can be an important component of a firm's marketing strategy, and may also act as a substitute for advertising, as it promises more impact than any other communication channel (Chen & Xie, 2008;Godes & Mayzlin, 2004). After all, \"Marketers may spend millions of dollars on elaborately conceived advertising campaigns, yet often what really makes up a consumer' s mind is not only simple but also free: a word-of-mouth recommendation from a trusted source\" (Bughin et al., 2010).",

When firms are better informed about the characteristics and quality of the product, prices may also provide valuable information to consumers, as they can be used as signals of quality (Bagwell & Riordan, 1991;Milgrom & Roberts, 1986). Thus, prices become a signaling instrument to encourage or discourage experimentation and thereby control the diffusion of information. In particular, low prices that generate WOM buzz can signal high product quality. Low prices (and higher sales) lead to increased product exposure, which amplifies the good (or bad) news generated through WOM communication.",

For their part, hosts would be equally remiss not to incorporate this fact into the pricing strategy. Here, eWOM can bridge the information gap between past consumers and potential consumers and help turn views into purchases. Indeed, Aerosolve, the dynamic opensource algorithm used by Airbnb to provide hosts with date-specific price suggestions, prioritizes the capture of a first and second review via penetration pricing. The fact that a property has no reviews is a negative \"feature\", which puts significant downward pressure on the suggested price. Even in a machine-learning environment (as in the Airbnb case), prices provide a signal from which consumers can infer product quality, even as they influence the rate of information transmission via interpersonal communication."

Moreover, eWOM is shown to be particularly influential for recently introduced goods: the volume of reviews has a significant effect on new product sales in the early period and decreases over time (Liu, 2006;Zhu & Zhang, 2010). On the other hand, extensive economic literature has explored the optimal pricing strategy and dynamics for new products of initially uncertain quality. Nevertheless, most signaling models have ignored learning from others and the question of whether and how interpersonal communication across consumers affects or is affected by prices. It is therefore interesting to study how a high-quality seller can take strategic advantage of experimentation and WOM when choosing his pricing strategy. This paper addresses these questions by providing a simple model in which WOM communication is combined with strategic pricing and signaling.",

            "text": "Specifically, I consider a two-period model, in which a long-lived monopolist introduces a new experience good of unknown quality to consumers. The monopolist is privately informed about his type (either high or low), and a high-type seller is more likely to produce high-quality products. Consumers are short-lived and the satisfaction they receive from buying is a function of both objective quality and personal preference (or taste). First-period consumers can only rely on prices to infer the monopolist's type (and therefore expected quality). Second-period consumers, on the other hand, learn through the observation of noisy signals of past prices and observed quality. Notably, past prices are not directly observable, as public price information usually refers to the posted price, which does not accurately reflect the final transaction price because sales, discounts, and/or geographic price variations are not taken into account. Furthermore, consumers have been shown to have imprecise memories when it comes to the final price paid for the product. 4 Still, past consumers report through WOM communication the satisfaction obtained from the product, if purchased. Reports from past consumers are noisy signals of the observed quality as higher satisfaction can come either from high quality or from strong personal preference. Moreover, communication between past and present consumers is incomplete because social interaction remains limited by time, geography, and other constraint. 5 Nevertheless, information gathered through WOM communication is more precise when the fraction of consumers who bought in the past is high."

First, I characterize the benchmark case without WOM communication among consumers, and show that there is no separating equilibrium. I then show that, when allowing for WOM communication, there exists a separating equilibrium in which prices signal quality. Given a sample information structure, I study how the separating equilibrium responds to variation in the signal precision and compare consumer welfare in the benchmark and WOM case. Finally, I present model extensions."

Moreover, in any separating equilibrium, the high-quality monopolist signals quality through a low introductory price (lower than the monopoly price). The intuition is simple: low prices are costly, and will only be used by firms confident enough that increased experimentation (therefore communication among consumers) will yield good news about quality and increased future profits. The low-quality monopolist, on the other hand, avoids information transmission by choosing a higher price (the monopoly price), which limits sales and the possibility of learning through WOM. An additional implication: for the high-quality seller, the expected price (quantity) is increasing (decreasing) over time; whereas for the low-quality one, the opposite is true. Since the second-period price is a function of beliefs, it will be higher (lower) if good (bad) news is revealed in the first period when the product is introduced. Moreover, the (low) separating price charged by the high-quality monopolist in equilibrium decreases as the impact of signaling on consumers' beliefs increases: a high-quality seller must work harder to discourage the low-quality one from mimicking its behavior if consumers pay less attention to their peers' reports. Finally, consumers are better off with WOM communication. As a robustness check, I show that WOM communication and advertising can be either substitute or complement instruments for the firm. In particular, when allowed to use WOM, the firm will never use \"money-burning\" advertising as a signal of quality. On the contrary, when advertising is demand-enhancing, firms might use both instruments to signal quality. Finally, the equilibrium is robust to reporting bias by first-period consumers. This paper contributes to the existing literature in at least three dimensions. I extend the signaling literature by allowing consumers' communication about product quality and by focusing on the case in which quality and costs are not correlated. The standard \"you get what you pay for\" result from the signaling literature is reverted when allowing for WOM communication among generations of consumers. Moreover, the situation in which quality is independent of marginal costs is particularly relevant for tech products with previously and exogenously research and development (R&D)-determined quality. The result also extends the marketing literature, by offering a point of reference for comparison vis-\u00e0-vis the heretofore dominant marketing strategy-advertising. Even though WOM and advertising are related (both are forms of communication about product quality), the former is consumer-created communication and the latter is firm-created communication. Indeed, WOM communication is more effective than traditional advertising because it is more informative, persuasive, and trustworthy. Finally, the results are consistent with empirical evidence: WOM has positive effect on sales (see empirical literature cited above), but also high prices signal low quality (Jin & Kato, 2006).",

            "text": "This paper is closely related to the literature on signaling quality through prices and/or advertising. Milgrom and Roberts (1986) study a dynamic monopoly model in which both (introductory) price and advertising can signal quality. The main result is that price signaling will typically occur and (dissipative) advertising will be used in equilibrium when separation through prices is too costly. The extent to which price signaling occurs (through high or low prices) depends on the relationship between quality and marginal costs. In the general case, in which quality is correlated with costs, both high prices (supra-monopoly) and dissipative advertising signal quality. 6 Low prices are enough to signal quality when high-quality producers are more efficient. 7 Prices and advertising are complementary instruments in the former case and substitute instruments in the latter when both act as demand-enhancing forces. Linnemer (2002) extends the previous model to consider a monopolist of intermediate age, so that some but not all consumers are informed about quality. Informed consumers here play a role similar to repeat-purchases in Milgrom-Roberts (1986). He confirms the Milgrom-Roberts (1986) result that (high) prices and advertising are complementary instruments to signal quality. Linnemer (2011Linnemer ( , 2012 provides a third explanation that justifies signaling through both high prices and dissipative advertising: two-dimensional types, which allow for different degrees of correlation between production costs and product quality. Bagwell and Riordan (1991) show that high (and declining) prices signal quality in a static monopoly for durable goods and for different informational settings. This result is due to cost effects: signaling through high prices generates lower sales, which cause less damage to a higher cost producer. Judd and Riordan (1994) obtain the same result by examining a two-period signal-extraction model with learning. Even though no correlation between quality and costs is assumed, private information on both sides of the market allows the seller to signal quality through high prices. I extend the signaling literature by considering WOM communication among consumers and analyzing how it affects the firm' s pricing strategy.",

Mayzlin (2006) explores the situation in which advertising takes the form of promotional chat on the Internet, so that advertising and WOM act like perfect-substitute learning mechanisms. He shows the existence of a unique (pooling) equilibrium in which low-quality firms advertise more than high-quality ones (contrary to what the advertising literature predicts), who instead rely more on consumer recommendations. Chen and Xie (2008) argue that the direction of the interaction between advertising and WOM depends on product characteristics and market conditions. Given sufficiently informative consumer reviews, advertising and WOM are complements when product cost is low and/or the ratio of expert consumers is high. On the other hand, when product cost is high, and consumers are mostly novices, advertising and WOM are substitutes. I extend the marketing literature by studying how WOM communication can be affected by prices and then used as a signal of product quality.",

When both firms and consumers are uncertain about product quality, initial sales help both sides of the market obtain information, so that low prices are optimal (Bergemann & Valimaki 1996, 1997Caminal & Vives, 1999;Schlee, 2001). Without information asymmetries, no signaling arises. However, signaling quality through quantities is the main scope of Caminal and Vives (1996) and Vettas (1997). In a duopoly model, Caminal and Vives (1996) show that firms cut prices in an attempt to make consumers think the product sells more because of its higher quality and not simply because it is cheap. Their main focus is on market shares as signals of quality, even though there is no communication among consumers. Vettas (1997) studies the informational role of quantities when allowing for WOM communication among consumers in a monopoly market for durable goods. In this model, there is no separating equilibrium, but only a pooling one in which a high-quality seller spreads sales to incentivize communication between consumers, and therefore information transmission. I extend the last model by allowing learning in equilibrium from both prices and other consumers. In particular I nest WOM learning, as modeled in Banerjee and Fudenberg (2004), in a two-period signaling model, in which learning in equilibrium comes from both prices and other consumers. Moreover, I exploit the fact that learning is noisy in the second period and the signals consumers receive can be ordered according to the precision criteria established by Ganuza and Penalva (2010), which facilitates the existence proof.",

The low-quality monopolist, on the other hand, tries to avoid information transmission by choosing a higher price, which limits sales and the probability that future consumers learn through WOM. This result contradicts the standard signaling literature, according to which high prices signal high quality. Moreover, it complements both the literature on quantity as signals of quality and the marketing literature by characterizing the signaling equilibrium when WOM is allowed."

Condition (i) implies that the cost of signaling through low prices is lower for the high-quality monopolist. So that, even when allowed to choose the optimal price, the high-quality monopolist will prefer to set a lower price than his low-quality counterpart, holding beliefs constant. The second condition (ii) requires that the shift from pessimistic to optimistic beliefs is more attractive to the high type than to his low-type counterpart. 20 It follows, from Proposition 5, that there is no separating equilibrium in which high prices signal high quality. The result is due to the properties of second-period beliefs, which guarantee that standard single-crossing is negative. As more supermodular precise signals have stronger influence on updating consumers' beliefs, an increase in ( , ) ensures a higher impact of the quality signal on second-period beliefs. Therefore, more sales will be detrimental to beliefs when news is bad and quality is poor, whereas they will improve the monopolist's reputation and profits when news is good. Bacause the high-quality seller is more likely to spread good news, he will benefit more from high first-period demand. This fact makes the existence of separating equilibria in which high prices (low quantities) 21 signal high quality impossible. Some additional implications: for the highquality seller, the expected price (quantity) dynamic is increasing (decreasing) over time; whereas for the low-quality one, the opposite is true. Because the second-period price is a function of beliefs, it will be higher (lower) if good (bad) news is revealed in the first period when the product was introduced.",

If I drop the first assumption, for example, WOM improves consumer welfare only if the seller is a high-type monopolist. Given this result, any policy that protects consumers ability to communicate about product quality without restriction or bias yields a positive result. Again, this is particularly relevant for newly introduced technological and digital products, for which online WOM has been shown to have strong effects on sales.

If the high-quality monopolist cannot profitably use price and/or advertising to manipulate information transmission among consumers, then any choice he makes will be costlessly mimicked by the low-quality firm. Similarly, when the monopolist can use both instruments to signal quality, he will only rely on low prices (therefore WOM) to signal quality, so that a separating equilibrium exists and it is the same as the one characterized in Section 3.2. Therefore, WOM (driven by low prices) and advertising are substitute instruments for the firm. The two instruments are similar in that, from the monopolist's point of view, they are both ways of throwing money away. Nevertheless, WOM entails a cost proportional to demand, whereas dissipative advertising is a fixed cost.

Second, advertising can operate as a \"megaphone\" for second-period consumers by stressing the effect of the quality signal on second-period beliefs. For example, suppose that firms pay information intermediaries a commission fee in return for a more favorable quality recommendation or pay search engines for prominent placement.

Thus, prices become an instrument through which firms may signal quality by encouraging or discouraging experimentation and thereby controlling the diffusion of information. In this framework, I show the existence of separating equilibria in which low prices signal high quality. Furthermore, I extend the model to check robustness and endogenize some model features. I compare the effectiveness of WOM-affected pricing and advertising in allowing high-quality firms to separate from low-quality ones, and find that (low) prices (that generate more WOM communication) allow separation, whereas advertising does not. I also investigate incentives for bias in consumer reporting, finding that in this context, consumers are driven to report observed quality truthfully.

The proof consists of two steps. I first show that there is no equilibrium price < that satisfies the intuitive criterion. Consider the price < such that ( * , ) is a separating equilibrium. Define \u2032 = + . Then, it is easy to see that (a) \u03a0( , \u2032 , = 1) \u2265 \u03a0( , , = 1) and (b) \u03a0( , \u2032 , = 1) < \u03a0( , * , = 0). Noting that * * > * and * > > \u2032 , it follows that * * > \u2032 > . Therefore, \u03a0( , \u2032 , = 1) \u2265 \u03a0( , , = 1). Moreover, by Proposition 5, \u03a0( , , = 1) < \u03a0( , * , = 0), then by continuity, \u03a0( , \u2032 , = 1) < \u03a0( , * , = 0). Thus, for any price, < condition (a) is not satisfied, violating the intuitive criterion. I now show that ( * , ) is the only separating equilibrium that satisfies the intuitive criterion. If \u2032 < , condition (a) is not satisfied. Then, \u2032 \u2265 . But if \u2032 > , there is no separating equilibrium, because any deviation at \u2032 > is profitable for the low-quality seller, as shown in Proposition 5. Then, it must be \u2032 = , and ( * , ) is the only separating equilibrium that satisfies the intuitive criterion. Note that the equilibrium price is decreasing in as from the last expression, the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. The numerator is negative because second-period beliefs are increasing in , the weight consumers attribute to signaling, when beliefs generated by signaling are the most optimistic, = 1; whereas the contrary occurs for the most pessimistic case, in which = 0. The denominator is the sum of two terms, both positive. In particular, the first term represents first-period marginal income, which is positive given < * * . The second term is also positive because first-period demand is decreasing in price, and second-period beliefs are decreasing in demand-the weight placed on the quality signal-when the price signal is the most favorable, = 1. \u25a1 Proof of Proposition 8.

After observing the pair ( , ), consumers update beliefs on the monopolist's type (and therefore product quality) and make their purchase decisions. If they buy, satisfaction is then observed. At the beginning of the second period, new consumers enter the market and form their beliefs by observing noisy signals of past price, advertising and observed quality.
