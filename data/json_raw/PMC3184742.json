Materials and Methods: The mandibular indices of 67 women over 35 years old were measured from panoramic radiographs, and bone densitometry was performed in the femoral neck and lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4), using DXA (Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) technique. The patients were divided into three categories of normal, osteopenic and osteoporotic in each skeletal region. One-way ANOVA and ROC curve analyses were applied. The results were considered statistically significant when the P-value was less than 0.05. Results: Comparing the mean BMD in the femoral neck in women between C1 and C3 subgroups of MCI, a significant difference was detected (P=0.04). The mean PMI in the three skeletal subgroups was not different according to the skeletal region (P>0.05). We found a significant difference in mean MI between normal and osteopenic subgroups in the femoral neck (P=0.042). Conclusion: Using radiomorphometric indices of the mandible (MCI-MI) may be useful in determining the skeletal status of the patients, but is not sufficient for precise evaluation.",

            "text": "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and micro architectural deterioration of bone tissue [1]. Bone loss occurs with age (age-related osteoporosis) in men and women but in the latter the rate of loss increases at menopause (post-menopausal osteoporosis). This reduction in bone tissue is associated with an increased risk of fracture, pain and consequent morbidity for patients. Since the disease is preventable, diagnostic techniques are of major importance. A considerable effort has been made to identify methods of detecting individuals with osteoporosis at an early stage to limit the disease process. In much a number of studies, bone mineral density (BMD) in the mandible has been described to be strongly correlated with that in the lum-bar spine and femoral neck, the most susceptible osteoporotic areas [2]. It is essential to use the panoramic radiographs for routine dental examinations especially before prosthodontic and periodontal treatments and maxillofacial surgeries. In panoramic radiographs, a number of mandibular indices have been made to do the quantitative measuring of the mandibular bone mass and trabecular architecture in order to diagnose patients with osteoporosis. Mental index (MI), panoramic mandibular index (PMI) and mandibular cortical index (MCI) are among these indices. Radiographs have shown that the decreased BMD affects the morphometric [3][4][5], densitometric [6] and architectural characteristics [7,8] of the mandibular bone on radiographs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between various oral signs and osteoporosis in women to determine whether these radiographic measurements have accuracy in predicting BMD in order to detect the disease in the early stage and prevent the consequent side effects.",

            "text": "This cross-sectional descriptive analytic study was based on 67 women in the age range of 36 to 92 years old who were referred to the Radiology Department of Mashhad Dental School. All of them had a panoramic radiography in their orders and none of the participants was known to have any prior fracture and systemic disease that would affect bone metabolism (chronic renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, gastrointestinal disease, paget's disease or rheumatoid arthri-tis). They were not using specific drugs or hormones (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, heparin, estrogen, progesterone, androgen and excess thyroid hormone). The data regarding age and BMI (body mass index) was obtained by questionnaire. All the panoramic radiographs were taken with PM 2002 CC apparatus (Planmeca Oy, Asentajankatu 6, 00880 Helsinki, Finland) by a single operator (AB). The position of the head was standardized as much as possible and also the exposure factors (kVp, mA) were regulated for each patient. To have similar density and contrast in all radiographs, we used both AGFA Dentus panoramic film (Heraeus Kulzer, Belgium) and Kodak screens (Kodak Lanex Regular Screen, Eastman Kodak Company, USA). Processing of the films was automatically performed by Protec processor (PROTEC medical systems, Stuttgart, Germany). For examination of the bone mineral density, DXA (Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry) scans were performed with Osteocore 2 (MEDILINK, France). This technique is widely accepted as the \"gold standard\" method of clinical bone mineral measurements [9,10]. DXA itself is subject to some minor inaccuracy in BMD measurement [6]. Precision of DXA ranges from 0.55 to 5% [11]. Sixty-seven panoramic radiographs were analyzed for MCI, MI and PMI. According to Jowitt et al [12], \"MCI is classification of the appearance of the mandibular inferior cortex distal to the mental foramen, which includes the following criteria: C1: The endosteal margin of the cortex is even and sharp on both sides of the mandible.  (Fig 2). All the measurements were made in millimeters (0.1 mm variation) with calipers by the same investigator (AB). The indices were measured bilaterally and the mean was recorded for each patient. When only one foramen was visible, the measurements were done only on that side [18]. The information on age and BMD statuses of the patients was blinded to the examiner in order to eliminate information bias. Afterwards we gave the patients their radiographs and referred them to Toos Bone Densitometry Center for BMD testing. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients to carry out bone densitometry as a part of the study on osteoporosis. BMD testing was per- C1: The endosteal margin of the cortex is even and sharp on both sides of the mandible. C2: The endosteal margin has semilunar defects (resorption cavities) with cortical residues one to three layers thick on one or both sides. C3: The endosteal margin consists of thick cortical residues and is clearly porous.  11). PMI assessments were not significantly correlated with BMD. Furthermore, the results of our study showed no significant correlation between PMI and bone densitometry variables ( Table 1). The area under the ROC curve (AZ) for MI was 0.344 (95% CI, 0.214-0.475) in the lumbar vertebrae and 0.388 (95% CI, 0.249-0.526) in the femoral neck and for PMI it was 0.410 (95% CI, 0.272-0.548) in the lumbar vertebrae and 0.400 (95% CI, 0.253-0.548) in the femoral neck. Since the acquired AZ, sensitivity, and specificity were low in each cutoff threshold, we used several cutoff points to determine the sensitivity and specificity.",

According to Table 2, we may conclude that of the osteopenic-osteoporotic patients, 79.4% in the femoral neck and 73.8% in the lumbar region had C2 or C3 cortex (sensitivity). In the women with normal skeletal statuses, 39.3% in the femoral neck and 36% the lumbar region had C1 cortex (specificity). 57% and 66% of the patients with C2 or C3 cortex had osteopenia or osteoporosis in the femoral neck and the lumbar region, respectively (positive predic-tive value) and 65% and 45% of the patients with C1 cortex had normal skeletal statuses in the femoral neck and the lumbar region, respectively (negative predictive value). It is demonstrated in Table 3 that by increasing the PMI, sensitivity increases and specificity decreases. The maximum sensitivity and the minimum specificity are related to PMI\u22640.46 and the highest positive predictive value is observed in PMI\u22640.29. The maximum negative predictive value and accuracy in the femoral neck was in PMI\u22640.29 and for the L2-L4 region, this value was detected in PMI\u22640.46.",

Similarly, Watson et al [23] did not find any difference in the mean PMI between normal (0.38) and osteoporotic (0.37) females in the 54-71 years age group, which agrees with Drozdzowska et al [1], who performed BMD measurements of the hip using DXA technique.

            "text": "Similar results were reported by Drozdzowska et al [1]. Klemetti and Kolmakow [4] also reported that the correlation between PMI and BMD of the femoral neck and spine measured in 355 British women were weak but significant (r=0.20-0.24, P=0.001), contrary to Taguchi et al [24]. One of the most commonly studied parameters of the mandibular bone in relation to osteoporosis is the porosity of mandibular cortical bone (MCI). Some of the investigators have found an association between MCI and osteoporosis [4,16,[25][26]. Dalili et al [27] reported the MCI frequency of 20.9%, 71.3%, and 7.8% of C1, C2, and C3 cortices, respectively. In the present survey, these values were 29.9%, 65.7% and 4.4%, respectively. The minor difference in the data between these two studies is due to the different age group of the women, number of the patients and also the variation in nutrition. The ability of mandible variables (MCI, PMI) to discriminate between normal and osteopenic-osteoporotic subgroups was poor to moderate. The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in PMI\u22640.33 in the femoral neck were 66.6%, 29.4%, 48%, and 48%, respectively and in the lumbar vertebrae were 64%, 28.5%, 57%, and 35%, respectively. In comparison with Drozdzowska et al's study [1], all the indices, especially the specificity were lower. If the cutoff threshold increases from 0.33 to 0.46, the sensitivity increases noticeably (91.1% in the femoral neck and 95.2% in the lumbar region). Drozdzowska et al [1] reported a 31% specificity, 93% sensitivity, 54% positive predictive value and a 83% negative predictive value for MCI in the hip, but in our study these values amounted to 39.3%, 79.4%, 57% and 65%, respectively in the femoral neck and 36% 73.8%, 66% and 45%, respectively in the lumbar region. The difference may be due to racial difference and number of cases. The current study indicates a significant difference in MI between normal and osteopenic subgroups in the femoral neck (P=0.042). Also, in the lumbar region, normal and osteoporotic (P=0.017) and osteopenic and osteoporotic subgroups (P=0.050) showed significant differences. However, Drozdzowska et al [1] noted that there was a significant difference in MI between various skeletal statuses (4.  [1] reported the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive and negative predictive value of 81%, 21%, 50%, and 54% for MI\u22644 mm in the hip. According to Table 6, these values for MI\u22644 mm in the femoral neck were 94%, 14.7%, 71% and 52%, respectively and 96%, 14.2%, 86% and 40%, respectively in the lumbar region. Taguchi et al [29] also determined the specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive and negative predictive values of 42.1%, 79.4%, 71%, and 53.3% in the lumbar vertebrae, respectively for MI\u22644.5 mm, which were 84%, 26.2%, 73.3%, and 40% in the lumbar spine in our study. Since on time diagnosis of osteopenic-osteoporotic patients may prevent side effects of the disease, in comparison with high specificity, high sensitivity is more useful. Compared with MI\u22644.5 mm, increasing the mandibular cortical thickness by 0.5 mm (MI=5 mm), the sensitivity increases to 64.7% in the femoral neck and 64.2% in the L2-L4 region, which has more considerable sensitivity than MI\u22644.5 mm.
