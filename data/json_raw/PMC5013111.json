Measurements of axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), corneal power (K1 and K2) and the measurement failure rate with the new Zeiss IOLMaster 700 were compared with those obtained with the IOLMaster 500. The results were evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses. The differences between both methods were assessed using the paired samples t test, and their correlation was evaluated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results The mean age was 68.32\u00b112.71 years and the male/female ratio was 29/72. The agreements between two devices were outstanding regarding AL (ICC=1.0), ACD (ICC=0.920), K1 (ICC=0.992) and K2 (ICC=0.989) values. IOLMaster 700 was able to measure ACD AL, K1 and K2 in all eyes within highquality SD limits of the manufacturer. IOLMaster 500 was able to measure ACD in 175 eyes, whereas measurements were not possible in the remaining 13 eyes. AL measurements were not possible for 17 eyes with IOLMaster 500. Nine of these eyes had posterior subcapsular cataracts and eight had dense nuclear cataracts. Conclusions Although the agreement between the two devices was excellent, the IOLMaster 700 was more effective in obtaining biometric measurements in eyes with posterior subcapsular and dense nuclear cataracts."

            "text": "The advancement of new technologies in intraocular lens (IOL) design and surgical techniques has increased the expectations of patients for exceptional postoperative vision without any refractive correction. The correct measurement of axial length (AL) and corneal power are crucial for the calculation of IOL power and achievement of the desired postoperative refraction. 1 Modern optical biometry devices use either partial coherence interferometry (PCI) or optical low coherence reflectometry (OLCR) to measure several variables including AL. In addition they can measure keratometry (K), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT) and horizontal white-to-white (WTW) corneal diameter using different approaches. 2 Moreover, the built-in software in these devices provides more accurate IOL power calculation and multiple choices of IOL formulas. 3 The IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany) is the gold standard of modern optical biometry devices. It uses the principle of PCI to obtain AL with high precision. 4 5 Several reports have shown the accuracy of IOLMaster (IOLMaster or IOLMaster 500) for IOL calculation in routine and complicated cataract cases. [6][7][8][9] However, measurements can be difficult or unreliable with corneal opacities, macular diseases, advanced and posterior subcapsular (PSC) cataracts, vitrectomised eyes or poor fixation for PCI or OLCR based devices. 10 11 The IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Jena, Germany), which is the first swept source optical coherence tomography (OCT) based biometry, was introduced recently. It enables OCT imaging and visualisation across the entire length of the eye. It provides an image-based measurement, allowing the surgeon to view the complete longitudinal section of the eye. Therefore, it may identify irregular eye geometries, such as lens tilt. Additionally, imaging of the fovea may alert the observer to insufficient fixation during measurements. It also uses telecentric keratometry for corneal power measurements, similar to the IOLMaster 500. Briefly, it was introduced as an advantageous diagnostic device in an attempt to improve refractive results after cataract surgery.",

Accurate AL, ACD and K readings are essential for all biometric formulas to calculate the IOL power required for the desired results. With the common usage of toric and multifocal IOLs, accurate biometry has become more important than ever to reach the refractory goals that patients expect. The most common preventable sources of error are incorrect AL measurements and keratometry readings. 15 IOLMaster was the first optical biometer available for commercial usage and its accuracy and repeatability made it the gold standard of biometry for many years. 16 17 Other optical biometry devices became available in the last few years. All these devices depend on patient fixation to a target. Poor fixation can be one of the reasons for AL measurement errors. Lens problems, dense vitreous opacities or foveal problems can also cause errors in optical biometry. In addition, with PSC and dense cataracts, the optical biometers available today can fail to take adequate measurements. 11 18 Swept source OCT based IOLMaster 700 provides an imagebased measurement, allowing the surgeon to view the complete longitudinal section of the eye. Therefore, it may identify irregular eye geometries, such as lens tilt, and imaging of the   fovea may alert the observer to insufficient fixation during measurements. This may allow for a more accurate performance of IOL power calculations and better refractive outcomes. Furthermore, the swept source OCT technology has the additional advantage of extremely rapid data acquisition, including the ability to measure the AL along six different axes.",

As the opacities are located nearer to the nodal point of the lens, more light rays will be affected. This can be one of the reasons for measurement failures in PCI or OLCR based optical biometries. 18 Using swept source OCT technology may overcome these problems and this could be the main reason for the higher acquisition rate for AL measurements with IOLMaster 700 in the presence of PSC or dense cataracts. In our study, IOLMaster 700 was able to measure AL in all 188 phakic eyes, including the PSC and dense nuclear cataracts.

            "text": "ACD measurements of IOLMaster 700 also correlated very highly with the IOLMaster 500. IOLMaster 500 does not measure ACD with PCI. The principal that IOLMaster 500 uses for ACD measurements is based on an optical section through the anterior chamber by means of a slit-illumination system with subsequent image assessment. It can be prone to operator errors and this method cannot measure the ACD in pseudophakic eyes. 20 21 However, IOLMaster 700 uses swept source OCT images and is able to measure ACD, CCT and LT from the single OCT image that is aligned with the visual axis of the eye. Our results show that ACD measurements with IOLMaster 700 are highly correlated with IOLMaster 500 (ICC=0.940). However, when we compared the mean differences of these groups, we saw that IOLMaster 700 measured ACD 0.08 mm shorter than IOLMaster 500. Although these values are very small for clinical significance, this finding is statistically significant (p<0.001). As only fourth-generation formulas like Holliday II and Olsen use ACD data, it will not affect the thirdgeneration formula results and this 0.08 mm difference will cause negligible IOL power difference for the fourth-generation formulas. Again, the ACD measurement failures were observed only with IOLMaster 500. For 13 eyes in which IOLMaster 500 failed to obtain a measurement, nine eyes had ACD measured >4.1 mm with the IOLMaster 700. In previous studies, ACD measurements obtained with IOLMaster 500 have been reported and compared with different US-based and optically based instruments, with variable results. [22][23][24] ACD values were reported to be higher 25 compared with ultrasonographic techniques in some reports and lower 26 in others. A number of reasons may be proposed for these differences. The IOLMaster 500 may not measure the axial ACD because the slit source is projected from the temporal side. Measuring the anterior chamber off centre may result in an error. Another possible cause is the inclusion of keratometry in calculating the ACD. Both of the above-mentioned potential sources of error are  eliminated in IOLMaster 700, since it uses swept source OCT images for the calculation of ACD. Keratometric measurements are the second important source of error for refractive outcomes. Both devices use a distance-independent telecentric keratometry system. In our study, nearly all of the keratometry measurements with both instruments were within 0.5 (D) for steep and flat meridians. Besides, the correlation coefficients for flat meridian (ICC=0.992) and steep meridian (ICC=0.989) show that both instruments measure corneal power with similar accuracy. Although very important for toric IOL calculations, axis measurements are not used by most of the current biometric formulas for spheric IOL power calculations and so we did not include them in the current paper.",

            "text": "With ICC close to 1, both devices are expected to give very similar IOL measurements in eyes with good fixation and no additional ocular problems, which is the case for most of the routine cataract cases we observe in developed countries. The main advantage of swept source OCT-based biometry like IOLMaster 700 becomes evident in patients with poor fixation, irregular eye geometries and denser cataracts."

            "text": "In this study we found that the IOL power for SRK/T, Holiday 1, Hoffer Q and Haigis derived by both devices were quite similar, and highly correlated. The mean difference was less than 0.10 D for all the formulas, less than the increment in the IOL power step (0.50 D). Although both devices did not have a clinically significant impact on IOL power, the chosen IOL formula should be considered. If the WTW measurement is required in a formula, such as in the Holladay 2, the result may be different."

            "text": "As a result, the agreement between the two devices was outstanding regarding AL, ACD, K1 and K2 values. However, the IOLMaster 700 was more effective in obtaining biometric measurements in eyes with PSC and dense nuclear cataracts compared with IOLMaster 500. The ability of the new swept source OCT-based biometry to detect the fixation pattern, decentration or tilt of the lens and the tomographic visualisation of the complete longitudinal section of the eye including the fovea helps to eliminate potential sources of error and, therefore, to optimise refractive outcomes in cataract surgery."
