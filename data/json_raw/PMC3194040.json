Their usual domain arrangement comprises a trypsin-type protease domain and one or more PDZ domains. All Deg/HtrA proteases form homo-oligomers with trimers as the basic unit, where the active protease domain mediates the interaction between individual monomers. Among the members of the Deg/HtrA protease family, the plant protease DEG7 is unique since it contains two protease domains (one active and one degenerated) and four PDZ domains. In the present study, we investigated the oligomerization behaviour of this unusual protease using yeast two-hybrid analysis in vivo and with recombinant protein in vitro. We show that DEG7 forms trimeric complexes, but in contrast with other known Deg/HtrA proteases, it shows a new principle of oligomerization, where trimerization is based on the interactions between degenerated protease domains. We propose that, during evolution, a duplicated active protease domain degenerated and specialized in protein-protein interaction and complex formation.",

The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains 16 genes encoding Deg/HtrA proteases [20]. Phylogenetic comparison of Deg/HtrA proteases from various organisms (including plants, animals, fungi and bacteria) revealed that this family is divided into four distinct groups [4]. DEG7 was the only protease from A. thaliana that clustered with Deg/HtrA proteases from fungi, forming a group of Deg/HtrA enzymes with an unusual domain arrangement. All members of this group are twice as long as other Deg/HtrA proteases, possess two protease domains (one degenerated) and up to four PDZ domains [2,4]. The best examined protease from this group is the Ynm3p protein (also called Nma111p, for nuclear mediator of apoptosis) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [21][22][23]. It is a nuclear protein [21,22] interacting with the nuclear core complex [22] and long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases [23], as assayed by Y2H (yeast two-hybrid) screens. In contrast with the yeast protease, DEG7 from A. thaliana (At3g03380) was identified as a chloroplast protein involved in the degradation of photodamaged D1 protein, a core protein of the Photosystem II reaction centre [24].",

We demonstrated that DEG7 orthologues are restricted to fungi and plants, including various algae and land plants. Using Y2H assays and SEC (size-exclusion chromatography) with recombinant DEG7 purified from E. coli, we show that trimerization of DEG7 monomers is mediated by the second (degenerated) protease domain. Table S1 (at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm). Conserved protease and PDZ domains were identified using the InterProScan platform at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory/European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi. ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan) [26]. Secondary-structure prediction and comparison was performed using the HHpred platform (Max-Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, http://toolkit. tuebingen.mpg.de/hhpred/) [27]. Multiple sequence alignments of full-length and protease domain sequences were generated by the M-Coffee web server using standard settings [28]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Phylogeny.fr platform (http:// www.phylogeny.fr) [29]. Gaps in the alignment were removed with the built-in curation method, and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum-Likelihood, Parsimony or Neighbour-Joining method. All methods resulted in essentially the same tree. Human HtrA2, E. coli DegP and DEG1 from A. thaliana, representing the best examined Deg/HtrA proteases from animals, bacteria and plants respectively, were chosen as outgroups, since they do not belong to the DEG7 group [4]. Models of the first and second half of DEG7 were created using the MODELLER 9v6 program [30] with multiple template alignment, using the structure files 2pzd.pdb [31], 1lcy.pdb [7], 3cs0.pdb [12] and 1ky9.pdb [9] as templates. Manual assembly of the obtained structures into a DEG7 trimer was performed using the PyMOL program (http://www.pymol.org/).",

Sequences of primers used in this study are given in Supplementary Table S2 (at http://www. BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm). A DNA fragment encoding A. thaliana DEG7 (At3g03380) was generated by PCR with SALK cDNA clone U21730 [33] as a template, using primers 0734 and 0740. The resulting cDNA fragment was cloned into the pET151-D/TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pHS36. This plasmid was mutagenized with primers 0724 and 0725 using the QuikChange \u00ae II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, resulting in plasmid pHS52 encoding DEG7 Ser206Ala . This mutation was introduced to prevent downstream applications (purification, expression in yeast) from negative effects of potential uncontrolled proteolysis. A change of the active-site serine residue to alanine does not influence the oligomerization behaviour of the protease domain, as was shown for human HtrA2 and E. coli DegP [7,9,12]. Amplification of the DEG7 cDNA with primers 0740 and 0799, using pHS52 as a template, and ligation of the respective DNA into pET151-D/TOPO, created a vector for overexpression of full-length His 6 -tagged DEG7 in E. coli (pHS166). Plasmids for the overexpression of DEG7 cDNA fragments were constructed by amplifying DEG7 Ser206Ala with the following primers: first half, primers 0740 and 0771; second half, primers 0747 and 0777; active protease domain, primers 0765 and 0774; degenerated protease domain, primers 0793 and 0797) and cloning the fragment into pET151-D/TOPO, resulting in pHS183 (active protease domain), pHS184 (first half), pHS185 (second half) and pHS186 (degenerated protease domain).",

All DEG7 orthologues share the unusual domain arrangement with two protease domains and up to four PDZ domains [2,4] (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ. org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm for sequence alignment data of the full-length proteins). The second protease domain is degenerated and lacks the active-site residues, such as histidine, aspartic acid and serine (results not shown), but is still recognized when scanned against the InterPro database [35] and the HHpred program [27] (results not shown). In contrast, four PDZ domains are not detected in every DEG7 orthologue, although the overall length of the proteins is comparable. This indicates that, provided the gene models retrieved from the databases are correct, some PDZ domains are not conserved enough to be detected by the domain prediction programs used in the present study. The domain architecture suggests that DEG7-like proteases evolved from a whole-gene duplication/fusion event of a DegP-like protease (containing a protease domain and two PDZ domains), followed by a subsequent degeneration of the second protease domain ( Figure 1, and Supplementary Figure  S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm). No DEG7 orthologues were found in animals, since all hits have much shorter sequences and no hit contained a second protease domain (query coverage <30 %; results not shown). Notably, genes coding for DEG7 orthologues were also absent from the genomes analysed of a primitive red alga (Cyanidioschyzon merolae), Cryptophyta (Guillardia theta and Hemiselmis andersenii) and diatoms (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Thalassiosira pseudonana).",

To investigate the oligomerization state of DEG7, we performed SEC with recombinant tagged DEG7 purified from E. coli (Figure 3). Three absorption peaks at 280 nm were observed during the elution ( Figure 3A). DEG7 was present in one peak, as analysed by immunoblotting with an anti-DEG7 antibody and SDS/PAGE with subsequent Coomassie Blue staining ( Figures 3B and 3C). The elution volume of 11.84 ml corresponds to an apparent molecular mass of 352 kDa, as identified by calibrating the size-exclusion column with proteins of known molecular mass. Since the recombinant tagged DEG7 has a calculated molecular mass of 120 kDa per monomer, this result indicates the formation of a trimeric complex.",

However, the unique domain arrangement of DEG7 raises the question of which domains mediate the observed trimerization (Figure 3). To address this question, a Y2H array was set up with protease and PDZ domains and combinations of these as baits and as preys: full-length inactive DEG7 with the catalytic serine residue mutated to alanine (DEG7-fl) was fused to the AD and BD domain of the yeast GAL4 protein respectively. Additionally, the first half (with the catalytic serine residue mutated to alanine) and the second half of this protein were also fused to the AD domain, as well as the BD domain. To analyse individual domains, the predicted active protease domain (with the catalytic serine residue mutated to alanine), the second (degenerated) protease domain, PDZ1 and PDZ3 + 4 domains were fused to the AD and the BD domain. Since the second PDZ domain in the first half of the protein was less defined (Figure 1), this construct was omitted. The resulting fusion constructs were co-expressed in S. cerevisiae in every possible AD/BD combination and tested for their ability to activate expression of the HIS3 reporter gene that indicates physical interaction of the constructs (summarized in Table 1 and Figure 4). No interaction  was detected when BD-and AD-fusion constructs were cotransformed with the empty AD or the BD vector respectively (Table 1), thus excluding autoactivation of the HIS3 reporter gene. Similarly, no interaction was observed for constructs containing only the PDZ1 domain or PDZ3 + 4 domains, indicating that the PDZ domains are not essential for the assembly of the oligomeric complex. In all combinations that activated reporter gene expression, at least one of the interaction partners contained the second (degenerated) protease domain (Figure 4 and Table 1). No interaction was observed when this part was lacking in both fusion constructs ( Figure 4 and Table 1). An additional interaction between the active and the degenerated protease domain cannot be ruled out, since some combinations (DEG7fl/first half, DEG7-fl/active protease domain first half/second half, first half/degenerated protease domain, second half/active protease domain, active protease domain/degenerated protease domain, given as AD/BD combinations) also activated reporter gene expression (Table 1, see also Supplementary Figure S4 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/435/bj4350167add.htm). This also indicates that the lack of reporter gene expression with the combinations first half/first half and active protease domain/active protease domain is not due to a lack of protein expression in the yeast, since some combinations including the AD-first half, the BD-first half, the AD-active protease domain, or the BD-active protease domain construct, promoted growth of the yeast strain on histidine-free medium (see Supplementary Figure S4). In summary, the Y2H data suggest that the second (degenerated) protease domain is the key mediator for the formation of the trimeric DEG7 complex in plants. The active protease domain does not seem to be sufficient for trimer formation, in contrast with all Deg/HtrA proteases investigated so far.",

Such truncated DEG7 constructs were affinity-purified as His 6 -tagged recombinant soluble proteins, and subsequently analysed by SEC and immunoblotting ( Figure 5). Although the constructs representing the first and second halves of DEG7 have similar calculated molecular masses (65.1 and 66.2 kDa respectively), they exhibit totally different elution patterns. The first half of DEG7 elutes as one peak in fractions between 14.0 and 14.5 ml (corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of approx. 75-100 kDa), whereas the second half of DEG7 is present in two distinct peaks (fractions between 9.5 and 10.0 ml, and 12.5 and 13.0 ml, corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 980-1300 and 170-240 kDa respectively). Similar differences in the elution patterns are also observed for the active protease domain as compared with the degenerated protease domain ( Figure 5). Whereas the active protease domain (calculated molecular mass of 27.9 kDa) is present in the fractions between 17.0 and 17.5 ml (corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 13-18 kDa) the degenerated protease domain (calculated molecular mass of 31.5 kDa) elutes as two poorly resolved peaks between 12.0 and 12.5 ml, and 14.0 and 14.5 ml, corresponding to apparent molecular masses of 230-315 and 75-100 kDa respectively). Although the estimation of apparent molecular masses of oligomers is too inaccurate to determine the exact stoichiometry of the complexes, these data suggest that the first half of DEG7 and the active protease domain are eluted as monomers, whereas the second half of DEG7 and the degenerated protease domains form at least two types of oligomer, possibly a trimer and a higher oligomeric complex. The inaccuracy in the estimation of molecular masses of monomers and oligomers could be due to sterical factors and the fact that DEG7 deletion constructs are probably far from a globular shape, which might be different for the intact protein. For the deletion construct containing the active protease domain, this might also explain the difference between the molecular mass according to the SEC and that estimated by SDS/PAGE, which matched the calculated values (results not shown). In summary, we can conclude from these data that only DEG7 deletion constructs with the degenerated protease domain are able to form oligomeric complexes, thus confirming the data obtained from the Y2H screen ( Figure 4 and Table 1, and see Supplementary Figure S4).",

For clarity, the approx. 100-amino-acid stretch between the second PDZ domain and the degenerated protease domain (Figure 1) was omitted. The oligomerization via the second (degenerated) protease domain might enable the protein to keep the catalytic subunits in close proximity, without the actual formation of a proteolytic active complex. This might ensure a very rapid initiation of proteolysis after binding of a substrate. However, details in this model, especially the relative orientations of the active protease domains, need to be resolved further.",

The unusual domain arrangement of DEG7 with two protease domains (one degenerated) and four PDZ domains requires a different mode of oligomerization than the one which was described for all other Deg/HtrA proteases. Although trimerization through an active protease domain is a common feature of Deg/HtrA proteases in bacteria and mammals, the active protease domain of plant DEG7 is not essential for this process. Instead, the second (degenerated) protease domain is responsible for the trimerization of DEG7 in plants.",

Clp proteases in bacteria, for example, are oligomeric serine proteases with a proteolytic core constituted by two heptameric rings, with each heptamer composed of identical proteolytically active ClpP subunits [37]. In chloroplasts of plants and in cyanobacteria, however, the Clp protease core is a heteroheptamer, containing three proteolytically active ClpP subunits and four inactive ClpR variants, which show sequence similarity to ClpP on the amino acid level, but lack the catalytic triad of serine type proteases [38,39]. A high sequence similarity between the inactive ClpR and the active ClpP variants indicates a common ancestor [40]. This is supported by the fact that loss of the catalytic triad appears to be ongoing process since some cyanobacterial ClpR variants still retain one of the activesite residues [39].",
