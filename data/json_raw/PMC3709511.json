However, very little is known about how the subsurface microbial community would respond to an increase in CO 2 pressure resulting from carbon capture and storage. Here we construct microcosms mimicking reservoir conditions (55\u00b0C, 5 MPa) using high-temperature oil reservoir samples. Methanogenesis occurs under both high and low CO 2 conditions in the microcosms. However, the increase in CO 2 pressure accelerates the rate of methanogenesis to more than twice than that under low CO 2 conditions. Isotope tracer and molecular analyses show that high CO 2 conditions invoke acetoclastic methanogenesis in place of syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis that typically occurs in this environment (low CO 2 conditions). Our results present a possibility of carbon capture and storage for enhanced microbial energy production in deep subsurface environments that can mitigate global warming and energy depletion.",

The underlying idea is to capture CO 2 rather than emitting it into the atmosphere and to sequester it in deep subsurface formations such as deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs 3 . This technology has the potential to reduce future global CO 2 emissions by 20% 2,4 . The economical and technological feasibilities of CCS have been extensively studied over the past decade, mainly from a geological perspective [5][6][7][8] . Recently, microbial effects associated with CO 2 storage also have been investigated in deep saline aquifers 9,10 , and the influence of CO 2 injection on microbial community structure has been reported. A study revealed that CO 2 injection changed the constituent of methanogens and sulfate reducers in the deep subsurface microbial community 10 . Oil reservoirs are also unique subsurface environments that are potential repositories for CO 2 sequestration 11,12 and often harbor active methane-producing microbial communities [13][14][15] . However, very little is known about the effect of CO 2 sequestration on microbial communities and their functional role in deep subsurface oil reservoirs.",

We selected a high-temperature oil reservoir, Yabase oil field, Japan, where we previously demonstrated the occurrence of in situ methanogenic activity 15 . Acetate, which is highly abundant in this reservoir (6-9 mM), is a primary precursor to methane. We previously found that methane was produced from acetate via syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in the reservoir 15 . To determine if methanogenesis would continue if CO 2 concentrations increased in subsurface oil reservoirs, we set up high-temperature and high-pressure incubation apparatuses (working volume: 1 l; Supplementary Fig. S1), mimicking the in situ oil reservoir (1,000-1,300 m deep, 53-65\u00b0C, 5 MPa; Supplementary Table S1). Production water from the reservoir used in this study contained 6.4 mM of acetate, 39.6 mM of bicarbonate and indigenous microbes. We inoculated 8 ml of crude oil and 800 ml of the production water as a source of indigenous microbes and nutrients into the apparatuses, pressurized with either N 2 or N 2 /CO 2 (90:10) gas to a final pressure of 5 MPa, and incubated at 55\u00b0C. The microcosms incubated under an N 2 atmosphere were designated 'control microcosms', and those incubated under an N 2 /CO 2 atmosphere were designated as 'CO 2 -injected microcosms'. Control and CO 2 -injected microcosm experiments were prepared in triplicate. Two of the three microcosms were amended with either a trace amount of 13 C-bicarbonate (final 400 mM) or [2-13 C]-acetate (final 87.5 mM) to track the methanogenic pathway.",

The pH levels in both microcosms were stable at B8.2 and 7.3, respectively, during incubation. The conditions in the CO 2 -injected microcosms were likely to reflect the bicarbonate concentration and pH in previously reported CCS sites ( Supplementary Table S1). In all microcosms, methane productions increased after at least 50 days of incubation, whereas methane productions in CO 2 -injected microcosms completed B30 days earlier than the control microcosms ( Fig. 1a,b). Acetate present in the original production water decreased concomitantly with increased methane production. Methane production and acetate degradation in microcosms labeled with stable isotope tracers were almost similar to unlabeled microcosms. Methane production was nearly equivalent to the acetate consumed. This stoichiometric methanogenic reaction suggests that almost all the methane formed was derived from acetate. Interestingly, the methane production rate in CO 2 -injected microcosms (0.36 \u00b1 0.04 mmol d \u00c0 1 ml \u00c0 1 water at the growing phase) was twice as high as in control microcosms (0.17\u00b10.02 mmol d \u00c0 1 ml water at the growing phase), indicating that CO 2 injection stimulated methanogenesis.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis showed differences in microbial community structure in the original production water compared with the incubated microcosms. The qPCR assays (Fig. 3a) of the archaeal 16S rRNA genes showed that (1) the original production water contained mostly the order Methanobacteriales and a smaller population of Methanosarcinales; (2) the control microcosm was similarly dominated by hydrogenotrophic methanogens affiliated with the order Methanobacteriales; whereas (3) the CO 2 -injected microcosms differed and were dominated by the order Methanosarcinales, many of which are acetoclastic methanogens. Clone library analyses supported the qPCR results. In the original production water and control microcosm, the genus Methanothermobacter dominated the archaeal community ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S4). The control microcosm bacterial community was dominated by a limited number of phylotypes that includes the genus Thermacetogenium 17 , a known syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacterium (99.8% sequence similarity) ( Supplementary Table S5). In contrast, all archaeal clones in the CO 2 -injected microcosms were affiliated with the acetoclastic species Methanosaeta thermophila strain PT (99% sequence similarity) ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S4). In addition, in the CO 2 -injected microcosms, heterotrophic fermentative bacteria such as Coprothermobacter proteolyticus dominated in the bacterial community and the known syntrophic acetateoxidizing bacteria disappeared ( Supplementary Table S5). These results clearly demonstrated that the main constituents of the control microcosm methanogenic microbial community were hydrogenotrophic methanogens and syntrophic acetate-oxidizers; CO 2 injection changed the community and led to the dominance of acetoclastic methanogens. These findings are consistent with the change in methanogenic pathways assessed by the stable isotope tracer experiment.",

To elucidate the underpinning mechanisms of the shift in methanogenic pathways in conjunction with microbial community transition by injecting CO 2 , we conducted thermodynamic calculations for the following reactions under various partial pressures of CO 2 : acetate oxidation, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis. The thermodynamics showed that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis becomes energetically more favorable with increasing CO 2 partial pressure, whereas acetate oxidation and acetoclastic methanogenesis become less favorable (Fig. 4a,b). However, acetoclastic methanogenesis is less sensitive to high CO 2 partial pressure than acetate oxidation because acetate oxidation produces two moles of CO 2 per mole of acetate, whereas acetoclastic methanogenesis produces one mole of CO 2 . The DG values calculated for the three reactions in the control and CO 2 -injected microcosms showed that acetate oxidation in the CO 2 -injected microcosm would be endergonic (Fig. 4a,b and Table 1), indicating that syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could not proceed under high CO 2 partial pressures but acetoclastic methanogenesis could proceed. A cultivation experiment verified the effect of CO 2 partial pressure on microbes; a pure syntrophic defined coculture 17 of Thermacetogenium phaeum strain PB and Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus strain TM was also inhibited by increasing CO 2 partial pressure (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4).",

            "text": "This study illustrates the possibility that an increase in CO 2 partial pressure will change the microbial ecosystem in a deep subsurface high-temperature oil reservoir. Our results suggest that CO 2 injection into deep subsurface oil reservoirs can alter the in situ methanogenic pathway and lead to the dominance of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Acetate is often the most abundant organic acid in oil reservoirs 18,19 and an important intermediate in methanogenesis from crude oil 20 . Given that acetoclastic methanogenesis generally leads to a faster methanogenic reaction than syntrophic acetate oxidation coupled to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary  Fig. S4), the shift to this pathway may result in an acceleration of methane production in oil reservoirs as observed in this study (Fig. 1a,b). Furthermore, the thermodynamics, in theory, suggests that the shift to acetoclastic methanogenesis can ease the thermodynamic constraint of crude oil biodegradation ( Supplementary Fig. S5). Perhaps, the largest window of opportunity for crude oil biodegradation via acetoclastic methanogenesis alone 21 may lend further support to the hypothesis that CCS may increase energy recovery in the form of methane through crude oil biodegradation. Our results present a possibility of CCS for enhanced microbial energy production in deep subsurface environments that can mitigate global warming and energy depletion at the same time. To date, very little is known about the influence of CO 2 sequestration on the subsurface microbial communities and their functions, despite their important contribution to global biogeochemical processes 22,23 . This study would intrigue not only geochemists but also microbiologists for further investigation of CCS in connection with utilization of microbial activities in deep subsurface.",

Molecular analyses were carried out for the original production water and incubated water from [2-13 C]-acetate labeled microcosms (at day 116 and 103 for the control and the CO 2 -injected microcosms, respectively). Total DNA was extracted from a 0.22-mm-pore-size polycarbonate membrane filter (Millipore, MA, USA), concentrating 250 ml of the original production water, 15 ml of the control microcosm water and 40 ml of the CO 2 -injected microcosm water, using a FastDNA Spin kit (MP Biomedicals, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified with primer sets Eub8F/Univ1490R 24 and Ar109F 25 /Univ1490R, respectively. PCR products were cloned using the pT7 Blue T-vector kit (Novagen, CA, USA). Clones were randomly selected (in archaeal libraries, original production water; 32 clones, control microcosm; 39 clones, CO 2 -injected microcosm; 35 clones, in bacterial libraries, original production water; 49 clones, control microcosm; 92 clones, CO 2 -injected microcosm; 84 clones), and the inserted 16S rRNA gene was directly amplified with T7 promoter primer and U-19mer primer (Novagen). Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes was carried out with a BigDye Version 3.1 reaction on an ABI3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Chimeric sequences were detected with the Bellerophon server 26 and removed from the sequence data sets. To group the OTUs and draw were calculated under the conditions at 55\u00b0C and 1 atm, and at 55\u00b0C and 50 atm, respectively. wThe Gibbs free energies in the control and CO2-injected microcosms were calculated using actual conditions in the unlabeled microcosms at day 116 and 77 of the control and CO2-injected microcosms, respectively, at 55\u00b0C and 50 atm. rarefaction curves, sequences were analyzed using FastGroupII program 27 with 97% sequence similarity.
