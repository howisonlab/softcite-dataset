However, the surgery is accompanied by an unavoidable risk of bleeding and subsequent requirement of blood transfusion 1-3). Transfusion of blood products is not a benign procedure and is associated with many possible risks such as infection, acute systemic reactions, and death 4). Transfusions also lengthen rehabilitation time and hospital stay and increase the cost for the patient 5,6). Therefore, blood loss control during and after surgery is an important consideration to achieve good results after TKA. Methods to reduce postoperative blood loss and avoid allogeneic blood transfusions include autologous blood transfusion, hypotensive anesthesia 7) , use of fibrin tissue adhesive 8) , drain clamping 9-12) , and administration of tranexamic acid 13-15). Tranexamic acid administration during TKA surgery is one of most studied method. Studies have reported tranexamic acid reduced blood loss and the amount of blood needed in transfusions 13,16). The administration of tranexamic acid also reportedly reduces the decrease in hemoglobin levels after TKA 17). A meta-analysis of 12 studies concluded intravenous tranexamic acid injections reduced blood transfusion and blood loss in TKA and total hip arthroplasty (THA) without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications 18). Another meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials concluded the use of tranexamic",

In these studies, however, the blood loss was measured as the loss during surgery plus the drainage volume. Since there may also have been hidden losses as a result of hemolysis and tissue extravasation, which would not have shown on drain output, the true effect of tranexamic acid on blood loss was not clear 20) . A true estimate of total blood loss can be more appropriately made using a hemoglobin balance method 20,21) . The calculated blood loss based on hemoglobin drop and body volume takes into consideration both the hidden and evident losses. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on total blood losses including hidden and evident losses through hemoglobin balance method 21) .

A posterior-stabilized type implant was used and the patella was not resurfaced in all cases. All patients received general or spinal anesthesia depending on the discretion of the anesthesiologist. A dose of 1 g cetrazole was given intravenously shortly before the operation. A tourniquet was applied around the upper thigh after elevation of the limb and exsanguination with an Esmarch bandage and inflated to a pressure of 280 mmHg before skin incision. An intramedullary alignment rod was used for femoral cutting and an extramedullary guide system was used for tibial cutting. Meticulous electric cauterization of the soft tissue bleeding points was performed throughout the surgery. The tourniquet was not released until skin closure and application of a compressive dressing. Intraoperative blood loss was negligible in all patients because the tourniquet was not deflated until wound closure. In each knee, one intra-articular drain was applied and connected to a high-vacuum drain bottle. The patients were asked to utilize an intermittent sequential 190 Seol et al. Effect of Transexamic Acid on Blood Loss Reduction after TKA pneumatic compression device for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as soon as possible. The compressive dressing and Foley catheter were removed on the first day after surgery. The drains were emptied every day and the amount of drained blood was measured. The drains were removed only when this amount was less than 100 mL for 24 hours. On average, drains were kept for 3 days (range, 2 to 5 days). This has been our institution's policy, as we have observed that removal of drains at one preselected time may not work in all cases. Some cases have collection for longer periods and early removal in such cases may not only cause erroneous lower recordings of drained blood but also has a risk of hematoma formation. Both groups followed a standard postoperative rehabilitation protocol, including continuous passive motion of the knee and muscle strengthening exercises on the first day after surgery. All patients were asked to get out of bed with walker support on the afternoon of the first postoperative day to decrease the incidence of DVT, as described by Pearse et al. 25) . Mechanical DVT prophylaxis using a pneumatic compression device was performed in all patients. Considering the low incidence of DVT in Asian populations 26) , routine use of pharmacological prophylaxis was not prescribed according to our institutional policy. Routine screening for DVT was not done for asymptomatic patients. Symptomatic patients with excessive calf swelling and pain were screened for DVT using Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography. All patients at discharge were explained about warning symptoms of infection and DVT and were asked to report immediately to the emergency department in case of development of such symptoms.",

            "text": "The difference in drain output between two groups was observed particularly on 1st postoperative day. This was primarily because tranexamic acid has a half-life of 3 hours and it remains in the extravascular tissue up to 17 hours 28) , after which it has no effect on postoperative bleeding. Therefore, postoperative bleeding after 1st postoperative day showed no significant difference between two groups. Despite this, the overall blood loss in the tranexamic acid group was 35% less than that in the control group. This was because most bleeding after arthroplasty tends to occur during the first 24 hours [1][2][3][4][5] . We found that tranexamic acid was effective in decreasing not only the evident blood loss but also the total blood loss based on the calculation using the hemoglobin balance method. It is difficult to compare total losses in most studies, as there is no uniform criterion for measurement. Most studies have not calculated total losses 22,23) . Few studies have used hematocrit drop 29,30) while others have used hemoglobin drop 24) . Some studies have taken 2nd postoperative day hemoglobin values 31) while others have used 4th postoperative day values 21) for calculation. We believe that hemoglobin usually decreases for initial 3-5 days after surgery and then begins to rise. The lowest value measured during this period best shows the true loss. Therefore, instead of a fixed day value, we used the lowest hemoglobin value for our calculation. We saw a reduction of 37% in total blood loss in the tranexamic acid group compared to the control group. Despite the utilization of different methods for calculation, most authors have shown tranexamic acid decreases total blood loss 21,29,30) . We also observed a 24% decrease in the need for transfusion in the tranexamic acid group, and this reduction was statistically significant in consensus with data in literature. In addition, not only was the number of patients requiring transfusions less, the total number of transfusions required for each patient was significantly less in the tranexamic acid group compared to the control group. The rate of transfusions in our study was a little high in both groups probably because of the female predominance; females tend to have lower preoperative hemoglobin levels compared to those of males. In our study, the postoperative hemoglobin was between 8-10 gm% at the time of transfusion in most of the patients who were transfused (16 in tranexamic acid group and 24 in control group) due to tachycardia not responding to fluid management; however, transfusion trigger has mostly been less than 8 gm% in literature 21,24) .",

However, we observed no adverse effects of tranexamic acid in terms of the development of symptomatic DVT and PE. The safety of tranexamic acid has been well established in literature. Recent reviews and metaanalyses have found no increased risk of thromboembolic events. They found that perioperative intravenous tranexamic acid administration was not associated with increased risk of complications. We recognize limitations to our study. First, the sample size (100 patients) was too small to address some questions. Second, the study design was not double-blinded, randomized and can only be regarded as a prospective comparative trial. Third, the operations were performed by only two (EKS and JKS) of the total authors of this study. Fourth, the female to male ratio in our study was high because most TKA patients in our country are females. Female patients may have lower preoperative hemoglobin levels and greater blood transfusion rates after TKA than males; however, the ratios of females to males and the preoperative he- 192 Seol et al. Effect of Transexamic Acid on Blood Loss Reduction after TKA moglobin levels were not different between the two groups in the study. Lastly, intraoperative anesthetic technique was determined based solely on the discretion of an anesthesiologist. This may have affected the total blood loss, and a study using a different anesthetic technique may be more appropriate. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the ratio of spinal to general anesthesia between the groups both groups, and thus we believe any effect the anesthetic technique could have on the results would have been the same in both groups.",
