The fermented characteristics of kimchi were investigated during 28 days of fermentation at 4 o C. The pH value in the sample with the cultured wild ginseng root was higher than that of control group. The total acidity in the sugar groups (SG groups) was higher than that of xylitol groups (XG groups). Comparing total bacterial count, XG groups were lower than SG groups, regardless of the additional ratio of the cultured wild ginseng root. Reducing sugar of XG groups decreased more slowly than SG groups for seven days; glucose and fructose of XG groups were lower than the control group. DPPH radical scavenging activity was higher in groups with cultured wild ginseng root than in control. In the result of sensory evaluation, XG groups were more preferred than other groups. In conclusion, our results indicate that cultured wild-ginseng root and xylitol have a positive effect on the quality of kimchi, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant functions.",

            "text": "According to the reports of Born et al. (5) and Scheie et al. (6), xylitol and sorbitol are sugar alcohols and glucose and maltose are saccharides substitutive for sugar produced by adding hydrogen to raw sugar such as xylose. In food processing areas, sugar alcohols provide functionality such as preventing dental caries and inhibiting the rise of blood sugar and furthermore, only 12% of xylitol and 84% of sorbitol are absorbed by the small intestine due to decomposition by bacteria. Concerning efforts to extend the shelf life of kimchi by adding different types of sugars, Kim et al. (7) reported that the addition of xylose and xylitol extended the shelf life of kimchi by affecting the organic acid fermentation of kimchi, while Moon et al. (8) reported the effects of xylitol and grapefruit seed extract on the sensory properties, fermentation and aging of kimchi. Ku et al. (9) reported that the addition of sorbitol and saccharide or the addition of oligo-fructose for kimchi fermentation by bifidobacteria provided nutrition for kimchi lactic acid bacteria and consequently improved the taste and enhanced functionality as probiotics by increasing the survival of bifidobacteria, as reported by Chae and Jhon (10). Several studies (5)(6)(7)(8)(9)(10) tried to extend the edible period of kimchi by adding xylitol, a kind of sugar alcohol, to Chinese cabbage kimchi; however, Kim et al. (7) reported that xylitol, which is effective in dental treatment, is not a fermenting sugar and therefore slows down the rate of acid production and extends the edible period.",

With the increase of the fermentation period, pH decreased gradually and showed difference among the specimens containing cultured wild ginseng. On Day 7 of fermentation, pH was 4.92 in the control group, 4.89 in the SG groups and significantly high as 5.0~4.95 in XG groups (Fig. 2). The quantity of xylitol did not make a significant difference in pH. This result was similar to the report of Park and Sohn (19) that pH of kkakdugi (radish kimchi) was not different according to the type of sweetener.

On Day 14 and 28, however, no difference among the groups was observed. In our study, the xylitol-containing groups showed a relatively high reducing sugar like the control group, and was probably because sugar was decomposed in various types of salted-fermented seafood as in the report of Lee et al.

This is probably because of antioxidant components such as saponins and ginsenoside known to be in cultured wild ginseng (23). Many studies are being conducted on the antioxidant effect of kimchi, and known antioxidant substances include vitamin C, \u03b2-carotene, phenolic compound and chlorophyll (24). During the fermentation period, DPPH radical scavenging activity increased and reached the peak on Day 14 (optimum maturity) and decreased to some degree afterwards. Lee et al.

On Day 14, the total bacterial count was significantly higher in the control and the SG groups than in the XG groups, and the same tendency was observed also on Day 28. The lactic acid bacterial count just after preparation was 3.89~4.10 log CFU/g, and was highest in the SG-0.1 group. Total bacterial count of SG groups was higher than that of XG groups. The lactic acid bacterial count reached the highest level on Day 14 showing optimal fermentation, and decreased significantly on Day 21 and 28 (P<0.001). The total bacterial count of XG groups was lower than the SG groups but the lactic acid bacterial count of SG groups was not significantly different compared to the other groups. This is consistent with the report of Chae and Jhon (10) that xylitol were used prebiotics in the intestines and improved the functionality of kimchi.",

The flavor of cultured wild ginseng was higher than in the control group, but spicy taste was similar regardless of treatment. Sweet taste was somewhat higher in the SG groups, and sour taste was not different among the groups, suggesting that xylitol does not affect sour taste. The reducing sugar content was low in XG groups, but according to the results of sensory test in Table 6, sweet taste and salty taste were not significantly different, and carbonated taste was significantly different in the XG groups (P<0.05). Texture was particularly higher in the XG groups as a substitute for sugar. In conclusion, the XG groups were somewhat higher than the SG groups in sensory preference.
