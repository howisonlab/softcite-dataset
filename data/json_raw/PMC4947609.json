            "text": "Introduction: Association of vitamin D, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, beside the classic bone metabolism disorders, may explain the pathogenesis of numerous diseases associated with vitamin D deficiency. While large numbers of reports support the relationship of vitamin D with inflammation, several reports fail to confirm this relationship. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are novel and inexpensive markers of inflammation that can be studied in all centers. The goal of this study was to investigate the association between 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) and inflammation with the novel inflammatory markers NLR and PLR. Material and methods: This study was performed retrospectively. Results of the simultaneously performed 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and creatinine level measurements and complete blood count were recorded. The data of 4120 patients were included in the study. Results: Between vitamin D deficient and non-deficient groups there were significant differences in PLR (p < 0.001) and NLR (p = 0.001). Vitamin D had a significant negative correlation with PLR (p < 0.001) and NLR (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that 25(OH)D was independently and negatively correlated with PLR (OR = 0.994, 95% CI 0.991-0.998, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio and NLR were significantly associated with 25(OH)D levels, and PLR was found to be an independent predictor of 25(OH)D levels. Our study revealed an inverse association of vitamin D levels and inflammation with these inexpensive and universally available markers.",

Vitamin D is an essential component of bone and mineral metabolism; its deficiency classically causes growth retardation, skeletal deformities in children, and osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults. Moreover, vitamin D plays a role in diseases other than those of bone such as cardiovascular diseases, obesity, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, infection, allergy, cancers and autoimmune diseases [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14].",

Amer et al. studied the association of 25(OH)D and CRP in 15 167 patients and observed a statistically significant inverse relation between 25(OH)D at levels < 21 ng/ml and CRP in a cross sectional study [21]. They reported that 25(OH)D at a level \u2265 21 ng/ml is associated with an increase in serum CRP. The authors concluded that the role of vitamin D supplementation to reduce inflammation might be beneficial only among those with a lower serum 25(OH)D. In several other cross sectional studies, low 25(OH)D levels were inversely correlated with inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrationsa marker of endothelial dysfunction [22][23][24][25]44]. Our study supports the findings of studies mentioned above and revealed an inverse association between 25(OH)D levels and the novel inflammatory markers NLR and PLR.",

There was also no association between 25(OH)D levels and WBC in our study, while there were statistically significant relations between 25(OH)D levels and PLR and NLR. These findings can be attributed to the sensitivity of NLR and PLR. Moreover, PLR was found to be superior to NLR in terms of inflammation [28]. Also, PLR was superior to NLR in our study. While PLR was a predictor of 25(OH)D, this association was not seen with NLR in logistic regression analysis.",

In a 12-week randomized controlled trial, Shab-Bidar et al. studied the association of 25(OH)D supplementation and inflammatory markers in patients receiving a vitamin D fortified drink (1000 IU/day 25(OH)D), compared with those receiving an unfortified drink [27]. Comparison of the changes of the variables revealed that a significant increase in serum 25(OH)D was accompanied by a significant decrease in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, hs-CRP, and serum amyloid A, and an increase in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In another clinical trial, Dutta et al. randomized prediabetic individuals into three groups (25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml, receiving cholecalciferol; 25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml, receiving calcium carbonate; and 25(OH)D > 30 ng/ml, also receiving calcium carbonate) and followed them over 2 years [4]. At the end of the study, the authors reported improvement in glycemic status, insulin resistance and inflammation following an increase in serum 25(OH)D levels, in the 25(OH)D receiving group. A study performed by Timms et al. in a population free of known diabetes or major illness revealed that vitamin D insufficiency was associated with increased CRP, correctable by supplementation [26]. In contrast to those studies, some clinical trials have failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on inflammatory markers [17][18][19]45].",
