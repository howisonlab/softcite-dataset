            "text": "People often choose to misreport their private information in order to improve their own monetary payoffs. Common examples include used-car markets, auto-insurance, and tax returns. This behavior often occurs in response to one of two types of request for information. An individual may be asked to provide a self-report (e.g., what is your taxable income?) or a confirmationreport (e.g., is your taxable income $50,000?). Because both requests ask for the same information-the persons taxable income-we would expect a persons response to be independent of the form of the request. However, to the extent that intrinsic lying costs are affected by the form of information request, we speculate that dishonesty will be different between self-reports and confirmation-reports. 1 Confirmation-reports may affect several sources of intrinsic lying costs including moral-lying costs (how I see myself), social-lying costs related to changes in perception of the requesters information set (how others see me), and lying costs related to the mental burden of devising a lie.",

            "text": "Despite a very extensive literature on lying, there is very little empirical evidence on the relative effect of these two types of reports on dishonesty (see discussion below). We contribute to the literature by identifying the effect of confirmation-reports on dishonesty. We answer the following specific research questions; are people more likely to respond honestly to confirmation-reports than self-reports? Also, do confirmation-reports affect the magnitude of lies told? Because it is difficult to observe lying in historical data, we answer our research questions with data collected from an artefactual field-experiment. We follow the traditional dishonesty literature in that we ask subjects to report the outcome of a six-sided die roll (Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi 2013;Jiang 2013; Ruffle and Tobol 2014;Hao and Houser 2017). Both the roll and reporting are done in private with no opportunity for either action to be observed by the experimenter. Subjects are paid according to their reported outcome, and their pay-offs are increasing in the reported die roll; with the exception of six, which receives a pay-off of zero. Therefore, subjects have an incentive to lie. Over 1400 subjects are recruited from Amazons mechanical turk, and are randomly assigned to one of seven groups. Subjects in group one are asked to make a self-report, while subjects in the remaining groups are asked to respond to a confirmation-report. The confirmation-reports are prefilled with a number between one and six, depending on the group, and subjects can either accept the report or reject it. Those who reject the report are given the opportunity to report any other number between one and six.",

First, the share of subjects who report rolling zero in the confirmation-report treatments is always greater than in the self-report treatment. This suggests, if anything, that confirmation-reports have a positive extrinsic-margin effect on honesty. Second, we find that the effect on the magnitude of lies told depends on the accuracy of the prefilled number. At one extreme, asking subjects to confirm rolling a six, which has a pay-off of zero, increases the share of zeroes by approximately eight percentage points and reduces the share of threes and fours by three percentage points each; there is no effect on the share of fives. At the other extreme, asking subjects to confirm rolling a five, which has the highest pay-off, increases the share of subjects who lie maximally by approximately seven percentage points, while reducing the shares of ones and fours by four percentage points, respectively. We suspect that these effects are being driven by some combination of intrinsic and extrinsic responses. Last, we find that females are more honest than males, and that females are less likely to lie maximally under the confirmation report while there is no effect on maximal lying among males.",

First, we argue that an accurately prefilled confirmationreport increases moral lying-costs and thus reduces dishonesty since subjects who face an accurate confirmation-report must reject the true report and then file a false report. Concurrently, a favorably inaccurate prefilled confirmation-report reduces moral lying-costs and thus increases dishonesty since subjects can \"shift\" the burden of lying onto the person who prepared the form. Second, the decision to lie is mentally burdensome since it generally involves two steps; the person must decide (i) whether or not to lie and (ii) the magnitude of the lie she wants to tell. The mental burden associated with these decisions is likely to be especially high given that liars generally want to maintain the perception of honesty (Greenberg, Smeets, and Zhrakhovska 2015;Hao and Houser 2017). In cases like these, people often turn to rules-of-thumb, which makes them susceptible to decision-making biases. Therefore, a subject might more readily accept an accurate or favorably inaccurate confirmation-report because it is easier than having to make the lying decision herself.",

First, to our knowledge, we are the first to identify the effect of confirmation-reports on dishonesty in an environment where extrinsic costs do not matter. Fonseca and Grimshaw (2017) and Kotakorpi and Laamanen (2015) estimate the compliance effect of administering an income tax with prepopulated tax forms rather than blank tax forms using data from a field experiment and a natural experiment, respectively. 4 Both studies find that a favorably inaccurate prefilled tax form increases noncompliance on the nonprefilled items. This finding is similar to our result where overstating the outcome of the die roll increases the share of subjects who confirm that die roll. Because these studies focus on tax evasion, the observed responses are driven by both extrinsic (audit and fine) and intrinsic costs. Unlike these two articles, we are able to show that confirmation-reports affect dishonesty even in the absence of extrinsic costs.",

Existing studies have explored several important aspects of dishonesty including the role of shame (Greenberg, Smeets, and Zhrakhovska 2015), guilt (Charness and Dufwenberg 2006;Battigalli, Charness, and Dufwenberg 2013), perceived unfairness (Houser, Vetter, and Winter 2012), gender (Dreber and Johannesson 2008;Muehlheusser, Roider, and Wallmeier 2015), magnitude of pay-off (Suri et al. 2011;Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi 2013), time preference (Ruffle and Tobol 2014), education (Ruffle and Tobol 2016), morality (Shu et al. 2012), and lying costs more broadly (Gneezy 2005;Abeler, Becker, and Falk 2014;Kajackaite and Gneezy 2017). A common feature of all of these studies is that they ask subjects to make self-reports using blank forms. We add to this literature by showing that the form of the request matters. Requesting information via confirmation-reports influences lying costs and thus increases or decreases dishonesty depending on the accuracy of the prefilled information on the reports. This finding is similar to studies that show that dishonesty can be influenced by changing lying costs either by having people commit to telling the truth (Shu et al. 2012), delegating the reporting responsibility (Erat 2013), or team incentives (Conrads et al. 2013).",

            "text": "Understanding the effect of self and confirmation reports on dishonesty is important for everyday life. It is particularly relevant in instances where people are hoping to obtain correct information but the provider of the information faces little or no extrinsic costs. For example, used-car markets and students giving excuses for missing exams or assignments. Other 2 On the one hand, a correctly prefilled report might cause people to believe that their private information is known to the requester. In this case, the social cost of lying increases because the person believes her decision to be dishonest will be observed by the requester; that is, she will be a known liar. On the other hand, an inaccurate confirmation-report might confirm the respondents belief that the requester does not know the respondents true information. In this case, the social cost of lying decreases because the decision to lie remains unknown to the requester. 3 The dishonesty experiment was conducted after the subjects had completed a survey about public opinion toward road user-charges. See implementation subsection for details. 4 Prepopulated tax forms require taxpayers to complete their annual tax reconciliation by filing a form that is prefilled with information available to the tax administrator, and is therefore comparable to a confirmation-report. applications include state-provided services for which there are no penalties for lying. 5 There is also an obvious application to tax administration. 6 However, we are careful in extrapolating our results to this context because cheating on taxes is a risky decision that includes extrinsic costs. Still, our results suggest that the type of form used in the reconciliation process matters for compliance, and that the effect of the form will depend crucially on the accuracy of the information available to the administrator. Policymakers who wish to prefill tax returns for taxpayers for whom true income is uncertain should prefill forms with a higher rather than lower numbers to reduce noncompliance. However, as a matter of practical policy making, it might not be ethical for the government to submit prefilled forms with information that is known to be inaccurate. Therefore, policymakers who implement prepopulated forms often limit them to taxpayers with known information, and our results also support this strategy. 7 The remainder of the article is organized as follows. First, we describe the experimental design. This is followed by a description of our results, discussion and conclusion.",

Although there has been discussions about the merits of a prepopulated tax form in the United States, the State of California is the only U.S. government to have implemented them under their ready-return initiative. ReadyReturn has since been cancelled, but its primary feature-prepopulating tax forms with pre-existing information-is still available with CalFile. 7 Of course, this strategy does not preclude the possibility of increased noncompliance among taxpayers who have only verifiable income in the current period, but earn income from nonverifiable sources in the future. Confirmation-reports could also increase noncompliance by inducing taxpayers to reduce their verifiable income and increase their nonverifiable income. 8 Notice that the payment for rolling a six is zero as in Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi (2013). Because the pay-off for rolling a six is zero, we recode the outcome six to be zero. This adjustment is made to the data for all tables and figures reported in the article. This design conforms with the previous literature; for example, Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi (2013); Ruffle and Tobol (2014). The main difference between our design and that of the existing literature is in the way subjects are asked to report the outcome of the die roll. The previous literature simply asked subjects to self-report the outcome of the die roll. We add to this by also asking some subjects to provide confirmation-reports. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of seven groups; one self-report treatment and six confirmation-report treatments. The only difference between the self-report treatment and the confirmation-report treatment is in step two where subjects are asked to report the die roll outcome.",

The Share of Subjects Confirming a Prefilled Number Increases in the Pay-off Associated with That Number Figure 8 also shows that the share of subjects confirming a given prefilled number is increasing in the prefilled number, and almost always greater than the expected share of 16.67%. To see this more clearly, we present-in Figure 9-the share of subjects in each group who confirm the number they are shown on their prefilled report. We refer to these subjects as confirmers. Figure 9 shows clearly that subjects are more likely to confirm a one than a zero, and more likely to confirm a two than a one, and so on. Notice that this finding is inconsistent with honest reporting. In other words, the share of confirmers should be equal to 16.67% if subjects are reporting honestly. Relative to SRT (see Figure 7), Figure 9 shows that the share of subjects confirming a given prefilled number is greater than the share of subjects who self-report that same number. To illustrate this treatment effect more clearly, we compare each CRT sub-group in Figure 8 to SRT in  Figure 7. For example, we identify the treatment effect of CRT0 by subtracting the share of subjects who self-report each number in Figure 7 from the share of subjects who report the respective number in Panel A of Figure 8. We repeat this for each panel in Figure 8 in order to identify the treatment effect of the other prefilled numbers. The results from this exercise are reported in Figure 10; each panel reports the treatment effect for a different CRT subgroup. Figure 10 shows that relative to SRT, confirmation reports increase the share of subjects who report a given prefilled number by 6.5-11.8 percentage points across all groups.

For example, we observe a significant reduction in the share of reported threes and fours coupled with an increase in the share of reported ones in CRT1 (Panel B of Figure 10). This suggests that subjects who would have self-reported threes and fours report a one when presented with a CRT1. This behavior is consistent with two possible explanations related to extensive and intensive margin lying-responses. On the one hand, it is possible that subjects who rolled a one and would have lied by self-reporting a three now report honestly, thus reflecting an extensive margin response. On the other hand, CRT1 could also reflect an intensive margin response in the sense that subjects who rolled a six now lie less intensely by reporting one instead of a three.

However, it is usually impossible to tell if subjects rolled the die because they make their die roll and reporting decisions in private. This information is important in our context since it is possible that subjects who are committed liars respond differently to the treatment than other subjects. Therefore, we designed the experiment such that we can identify subjects who clicked on the die-roll link. We refer to those subjects who clicked on the link as \"rollers,\" and those who did not click on the link as \"non-rollers.\" 14 This section describes how our results are affected when we cut the data by roller status. Table 4 shows that approximately 36% of subjects in both SRT and CRT are nonrollers; that is, they did not click on the die-roll link before making their reporting decision. With the exception of CRT1 (30%) and CRT2 (40%), this share is fairly flat across CRT subgroups. Additionally, there is no difference in the likelihood of being a nonroller across gender or race. Younger subjects are more likely to be nonrollers, but the estimated effect is not economically meaningful. The only demographic characteristic that is strongly correlated with nonroller is education level; the likelihood of being a nonroller decreases with education level. 15 These differences are not worrisome since the treatment groups are balanced with respect to education level. However, given that each subjects is 7.4%, just as in SRT, (ii) the confirmation-report does not affect the propensity to report any of the other numbers honestly, and (iii) subjects who report a zero payoff are honest. The first assumption follows from randomization of subjects into groups. The fact that the share of zeroes in each panel of Figure 10 is not statistically different from 7.4% is further evidence that the share of unconditionally honest subjects is at least 7.4% across all groups. The second assumption is supported by the treatment effects in Panel A of Figure 10. 14 We are only able to tell if the link was clicked; we cannot observe the outcome of the die roll. Also, we cannot rule out the possibility that nonrollers actually rolled a die. For example, it is possible that they simply bypassed our link to the virtual die, or that they rolled their own physical die. As mentioned before, our inability to observe the die outcome was made clear to subjects. 15 The share of nonrollers among subjects with a graduate degree is 25%. Relative to graduate degree holders, subjects with a bachelors degree, some college, and high school diploma are 11%, 10%, and 15%, respectively, more likely to be nonrollers. These differences are both economically and statistically significant.",

A particularly useful point of comparison is Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi (2013) whose baseline-experimental design is similar to our SRT treatment. They estimate that their sample includes 39% unconditionally honest subjects, 22% maximal liars, and a nontrivial amount of partial lying. Our results are largely comparable to theirs, which is reassuring on two levels. First, though use of the mTurk subject pool has grown significantly in recent years, there still remains some skepticism. Therefore, the fact that Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi (2013) baseline results are replicated in the mTurk sample ought to increase confidence in our results. Second, mTurkers generally complete HITs for very low wages and as such the stakes in our experiment are low relative to the existing literature. For example, ignoring exchange rate differences, the stakes in Fischbacher and F\u20ac ollmi-Heusi (2013) are 10 times as high as in our experiment. Still, our baseline results are very similar to theirs, which suggests Notes: Reported is the effect gender on reporting behavior for the confirmation-report treatments. For each panel, each bar represents the share of females reporting that number minus the share of males reporting that number. Because the pay-off for rolling a 6 is zero, we recode the outcome 6 as 0.",

We argue that confirmation-reports affect the moral cost of lying by changing the salience of subjects own moral standards. For example, a subject who faces an accurate confirmation-report has to engage in two distinct dishonest acts if she wishes to lie; she must reject the true statement, then report a false statement. These two decisions have a greater effect in activating her moral standards relative to a self-report, and thus increases the moral costs of lying. On the other hand, CRT reduces the moral-lying costs of subjects who are asked to confirm an advantageous false statement because they can shift the blame of lying to the person who prepared the confirmation report without necessarily activating her own moral standards. For example, Erat (2013) finds that people are more likely to lie if the burden of lying can be shifted to a delegate. We argue that these opposing effects on the moral cost of lying is a possible explanation for our results.",

CRT subjects who roll a zero and are asked to confirm a zero face higher lying costs relative to subjects who rolled a zero in SRT. We would therefore expect an increase in the share of reported zeroes in CRT relative to SRT, and this is exactly what we find. Importantly, because there is no incentive to report a zero unless it is the truth, we can interpret the increase in the share of reported zeroes as an increase in honesty. Similarly, CRT subjects who rolled a number less than five, but are asked to confirm rolling a five, face lower lying costs relative to SRT subjects who rolled a number less than five. Therefore, we would expect an increase in the share of reported fives in CRT5 relative to SRT. Again, this is what we find. Because subjects do not have an incentive to report a number lower than their actual roll, we argue that the treatment effect for reported fives in CRT5 reflects an increase in dishonesty.",

Prefilling the confirmation report with the number three reduces the lying cost for subjects in the first two bins and increases the lying cost for those in the third bin. The impact on lying costs for those who roll a four is unclear. This suggests that the share of reported threes should increase, which is what we observe, and that this effect is driven by the response of subjects in the first three bins. The greater share of threes reflects an increase in lying among subjects in the first bin since they experience lower lying costs. It also possibly includes a reduction in the magnitude of the lie told by subjects in the second bin. In other words, subjects who roll a one and would have self-reported a five now report a three; they still lie, but the magnitude of the lie is smaller. Finally, the effect of prefilling the report with the number three includes increased honesty among subjects who actually roll a three because these subjects experience higher lying costs.",

Economists have highlighted in numerous areas, including health care plans (Samuelson and Zeckhauser 1988), automobile insurance (Johnson et al. 1993), retirement saving plans (Madrian and Shea 2001), and organ donor registration (Johnson and Goldstein 2003;Li, Hawley, and Schnier 2013), that people often choose the default option they are assigned in order to reduce decision-making costs. Because it is less mentally burdensome to accept the default number shown on the confirmation report than to decide on a number to report, we would expect subjects who roll a number x y to be more likely to confirm rolling y than self-reporting y. We argue that this channel is especially relevant among nonrollers. To the extent that nonrollers did not in fact roll a die, they need to decide which number to self-report in order to maximize their pay-off while maintaining a semblance of honesty. 20 The default option presented in the confirmation-report simplifies this decisionmaking calculus by allowing the subject to simply accept the prepopulated number. Unlike rollers, nonrollers do not have an actual die outcome (x) with which to compare the prepopulated number (y). Therefore, it is not surprising that, relative to rollers, nonrollers are more likely to accept y, thus leading to much larger treatment effects among nonrollers.",

Second, subjects know that we only observe their mTurk ID and therefore have no way of knowing any of them personally. Third, the actual reported outcomes appear to be inconsistent with this explanation. For example, if prefilling the form with say three, fours and fives lead subjects who roll a zero to believe we do not know their actual outcomes, then we would expect to observe a significant drop in the share of reported zeroes in treatments CRT3, CRT4, and CRT5 relative to SRT and relative to CRT0, CRT1 and CRT2.

This is because these subjects either rolled a physical die, rolled a virtual die on some other website, bypassed our weblink in order to roll the die on random.org, or did not roll a die at all. In either case, these subjects should be reassured that the researchers do not know the actual outcome of the die roll, and so, their beliefs of the researchers information set should be independent of the prefilled number. This suggests that the treatment effect of CRT0 on the share of subjects who confirm rolling zero should be lower among nonrollers relative to rollers. Similarly, the treatment effect of CRT5 on the share of subjects who confirm rolling five should be higher among nonrollers relative to rollers. However, this is not what we observe. In fact, the treatment effect of CRT0 on confirmed zeroes is much higher among nonrollers, while the treatment effect of CRT5 on confirmed fives is lower among nonrollers.

Consider taxpayers who have both third-party reported (e.g., wage income subject to W2 reporting in the US) and self-employment income (e.g., income reported on form 1099 in the US). These taxpayers may be of one of three types. The first type of taxpayer reports some of her W2 income and none of her self-employment income. Our results suggest that switching to prepopulated tax returns under these conditions would increase compliance for two reasons: (i) people are more likely to confirm prefilled information that is favorably inaccurate, and (ii) W2 income is easily verifiable. 23 Of course, compliance with third-party income is already very high; for example, estimates put the compliance rate for W2 income at 99% in the United States (Slemrod 2007). Therefore, the positive effect on compliance from the introduction of prepopulated tax returns among this group of taxpayers is likely to be very small.",

The compliance rate among these taxpayers is likely to be unaffected by a switch to prefilled tax returns because the prefilled return reflects what the taxpayer would have self-reported. Finally, there are taxpayers who report all of their W2 income and some or all of their selfemployment income. Our results suggest that switching to prepopulated tax forms that are based solely on third-party reported information would increase noncompliance among these taxpayers. This follows from the fact that people are more likely to confirm favorably inaccurate information. Notice that in this case, the prepopulated information on total income is both inaccurate and lower than what the taxpayer would have self-reported. Another implication of our findings is that policymakers who wish to reduce noncompliance among these two types of taxpayers could prefill self-employment income on tax forms with high income values. 24 However, as a matter of practical policy making, it might be unethical for the government to knowingly provide taxpayers with inaccurate prefilled tax returns. Therefore, we recommend that policymakers who wish to implement prepopulated tax forms limit them to taxpayers whose income is easily verifiable.",

We would expect a small positive effect on compliance if all income is subject to third-party reporting. This is because compliance with third-party income is already very high. However, the net effect depends on the existing level of compliance if there is at least some income not subject to third-party reporting. 22 Recall that our experiment does not include any extrinsic costs. Therefore, our findings/policy implications are based solely on the direct effect of the form, and excludes any indirect effects that might occur through perceived (or actual) changes in extrinsic costs. 23 The taxpayer is unlikely to reduce the prefilled W2 income because she knows that the tax administrator has thirdparty information on her W2 income. This effect is also likely to hold for taxpayers who only have third-party reported income. 24 The determination of self-employment status as well as realistic \"high\" values for self-employment income could be determined from tax returns of previous years.",

Auto insurers often ask policy holders to self-report their annual VMT and use this information in pricing insurance policies. Those who drive more tend to have a higher accident risk and are therefore charged higher insurance premiums. Therefore, policyholders have an incentive to underreport their VMT. 26 Insurance companies can rely on several techniques to obtain accurate mileage information. 27 One suggested technique uses two steps. First, known information about customers is used to predict their annual mileage; for example, gender, age, education, employment commute times, vehicle type, and vehicle age. Second, customers are asked to confirm that the predicted mileage is correct using confirmation reports. The effect of this approach on underreporting depends on the accuracy of the predicted mileage. Assuming that the predicted mileage is fairly accurate, our findings suggest that this approach could significantly reduce the under-reporting problem.",

Ideally, a road mileage user-fee would be implemented with the aid of advanced technology that accurately measures vehicle mileage. However, due to costs and privacy concerns, there has been some resistance to mileage user-fees and the use of advanced technology in particular (Duncan et al. 2014). Because of these costs and privacy concerns, administration with odometer readings is generally included as an optional way of collecting mileage information. While odometer reading largely solves the privacy and cost problems, it raises concerns about evasion. Our results suggest that obtaining a fairly accurate estimate of vehicle miles traveled coupled with a confirmation report is likely to reduce noncompliance. This could serve to reduce the number of required audits and hence the cost of administration.",

Each subject is asked to roll a virtual die and report the outcome of the die roll either by completing a self-report or confirmation report. We find strong evidence of lying in both treatments. We also find that the effect of confirmation report is heterogenous across prefilled number, gender, and roller status. Overall, we find that people are more likely to confirm the truth than to self-report the truth, and more likely to confirm a lie than to tell a lie. We attribute our findings to intrinsic costs which are influenced through the impact of confirmation reports on moral-lying costs and decision-making costs. 25 Almost all countries with a prepopulated tax system either limit to their system to (or began with) taxpayers with only wage income that is easily monitored for accuracy. 26 According to a 2008 report by Quality Planning company, the car insurance industry missed out on $15.9 billion in revenues of which more than $3 billion is due to underreported vehicle mileage. 27 These include asking the customer, asking the agent, historical odometer readings, mileage models, and telematics using an after-market device, smartphone OEM-based or smartphone odometer app (Cantwell 2015).",
