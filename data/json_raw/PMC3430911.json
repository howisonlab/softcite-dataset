            "text": "This study was designed to investigate whether long-term, low-level exposure to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) induced insulin resistance. Methods: The subjects were 110 male workers who were occupationally exposed to styrene, toluene, and xylene. One hundred and ten age-matched male workers who had never been occupationally exposed to organic solvents were selected as a control group. Cytokines, which have played a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, and oxidative stress indices were measured. Assessment of exposure to MAHs was performed by measuring their ambient levels and their urinary metabolites in exposed workers, and the resulting parameters between the exposed group and non-exposed control groups were compared. Results: There was no significant difference in general characteristics and anthropometric parameters between the two groups; however, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance levels were significantly higher in the exposed group. Phenylglyoxylic acid levels showed significant association with tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, total oxidative status, and oxidative stress index via multiple linear regression analysis. Further, there was a negative correlation between methylhippuric acid levels and total anti-oxidative capacity, and there was a significant relationship between MAHs exposure and fasting glucose levels, as found by multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio = 3.95, 95% confidence interval = 1.074-14.530). Conclusion: This study indicated that MAHs increase fasting glucose level and insulin resistance. Furthermore, these results suggested that absorbing the organic solvent itself and active metabolic intermediates can increase oxidative stress and cytokine levels, resulting in the changes in glucose metabolism and the induction of insulin resistance.",

            "text": "Some studies have reported that exposure to organic solvents may be related to insulin resistance (IR) or associated metabolic syndrome (MetS). Kaukiainen et al. [8] reported that workers exposed to organic solvent mixtures had higher fasting glucose levels, and Hong et al. [9] mentioned that environmental contaminants including organic solvents may result in IR. Although the relationship between organic solvent exposure and IR has not been directly described, it has been reported that exposure to organic solvents increased cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) which are involved in inflammatory responses [6,10] and increased oxidative stress while reducing the activities of antioxidant enzymes [11,12]. It has also been reported that increased cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) play a critical role in the development of IR as well as being involved in immunological reactions and signal transductions [13,14]; and that increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in blood glucose elevation and development of IR through activating c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and I\u03ba\u03b2 kinase B (IKK\u03b2), which are stress kinases, leading to accelerated phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) serine [15,16]. However, studies on the relationship between exposure to low-level monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs) and IR and the pathogenesis of IR have been exceedingly insufficient in both Korea and other countries and thus, such studies are increasingly needed.",

Therefore, we carried out this study to analyze the characteristics of working environments in manufacturing factories in Korea and analyzed their relationship with IR to   www.e-shaw.org compare the results with those from other countries and clearly identify the relationship. We studied styrene, toluene, and xylene, which are MAHs widely used in industries in paint, plastic and rubber manufacturing as thinner, and attempted to understand the effect of exposure to these chemicals on the development of IR with a specific focus on cytokines and oxidative stress. With regard to lifestyle, Pardee et al. [21] reported that television viewing time was associated with hypertension and obesity, and that TV viewing time was reported to be positively correlated with BMI [22]. Mummery et al. [23] also reported that time spent sitting was positively correlated with BMI. In addition, De Le\u00f3n et al. [24] reported that there were direct associations between a sedentary lifestyle and triglyceride, IR, and MetS. Thus, these results suggest that induction of hypertension, obesity, IR, and MetS is associated with sedentary behaviors. However, in this study, a comparison of anthropometric results between the control and exposed groups showed no statistically significant difference. This result may be due to the lack of a significant difference in general characteristics that may have affected the anthropometric results between the groups. Therefore, we can induce that the effects of lifestyle and so on are ignorable in the various results of the analysis and in the the interpretation of the analysis in these two groups. Mokuda et al. [25] reported that liver damage induced by carbon tetrachloride increased glucose and insulin levels in blood, and Kaukiainen et al. [8] reported that fasting blood glucose levels were higher in those exposed to mixed organic solvents than in the control group who were not exposed to hazardous chemicals: organic solvent exposure was positively correlated with glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride though these were within reference ranges. In the present study, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the exposed group. This result was comparable to other reports, and thought to be the effect of exposure to MAHs.",

TNF-\u03b1 is known to have a biological action opposite to adiponectin, even though its three-dimensional structure is very similar to that of adiponectin. These two are known to inhibit the production and action of each other [28]. TNF-\u03b1 also elevates blood fatty acids by promoting lipolysis in adipocytes, which may cause a decrease in insulin [29]. IL-1\u03b2 may suppress IRS-1 expression ERK-dependently during transcription and ERK-independently during post-transcription, which may damage insulin signaling [14]. Among cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured and compared between the exposed and control groups in this study. Only TNF-\u03b1 levels were significantly higher in the exposed group compared to controls, and IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 levels were not significantly different, though somewhat higher in the exposed group. Multiple linear regression analysis between these cytokines and organic solvents did not show any significance; however, cytokines and metabolites of organic solvents showed a significant relationship. Further, PGA, a metabolite of styrene, affected TNF-\u03b1 positively, meaning that there was an increase in TNF-\u03b1 levels in the exposed group, and positively correlated with PGA. It is likely that TNF-\u03b1 induced an initial immune reaction and diseases such as IR with a larger quantity than required for maintaining normal physiological function. In this study, IL-6 was not significantly high; however, others have reported that it increases IR by increasing free fatty acid levels in blood [30] and partly induces IR by stimulating the degradation of body fat, interrupting glucose metabolism, and decreasing the adiponectin [31].",

From the results above, we can confirm that MAHs exposure increases fasting glucose and IR. This high level of IR in the exposed group is thought to be due to the effect of oxidative stress and changes in physiological levels of cytokines that are generated by unchanged organic solvents and the active metabolic intermediate produced during glucose metabolism and degradation (Fig. 2).",

Second, the www.e-shaw.org subjects were exposed to MAHs at low levels, and physiological levels of cytokines and levels of oxidative stress could not be compared according to different exposure levels. Third, active metabolic intermediates, transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, and kinases that affect cytokines and oxidative stress were not measured but interpreted by citing the results from other researchers. Therefore, studies investigating clear mechanisms obtained via evaluating the levels of metabolic intermediates and transcription factors are needed in future research.",
