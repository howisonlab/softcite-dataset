We evaluated the efficacy of standardized combination antibiotic therapy and the factors that might affect unfavorable microbiologic responses in patients with MAC pulmonary disease. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study reviewed data from 96 patients (56 females; median age 59 years) treated with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease between January 2003 and December 2006. Results: All patients received standardized combination antibiotic therapy, consisting of clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol. Streptomycin was additionally given in 72 patients (75%) for a median duration of 4.5 months. The overall favorable microbiologic response rate was 79% (76/96); 20 patients (21%) had unfavorable microbiologic responses, including failure to sputum conversion (n = 13), relapse (n = 3), and MACrelated death (n = 4). A positive sputum acid-fast bacillus smear at the start of treatment was an independent predictor of an unfavorable microbiologic response. Conclusion: Standardized combination antibiotic therapy consisting of clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol with or without initial use of streptomycin is effective in treating patients with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease.",

            "text": "In many countries, including Korea, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), which includes Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare, is the most common etiology of lung disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). 1,2 Currently, the accepted standard therapy for patients with MAC lung disease involves the use of a macrolide-based multidrug regimen that consists of a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin), a rifamycin (rifampicin or rifabutin), and ethambutol with or without initial use of streptomycin or amikacin. 3,4 However, available data on macrolide-based therapy demonstrate that successful eradication of MAC pulmonary infection is achieved in only 60% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients. 5 In Korea, the Korean Academy of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases recommends a combination antibiotic therapy that includes daily clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol with or without initial use of streptomycin. 6 At our INTRODUCTION institution, we typically prescribe this triple-drug regimen for the treatment of MAC lung disease. Furthermore, streptomycin has actively been used in patients with radiographically extensive or cavitary disease, especially when accompanied by positive sputum smears. 7 In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of this standardized combination antibiotic therapy and the factors that might affect unfavorable microbiologic responses in patients with MAC pulmonary disease.",

Furthermore, some patients do not require treatment, whereas others require combination antibiotic therapy, including parenteral agents. After discussing this information with patients, we implemented an observation period of at least 6-12 months with no antibiotic treatment. When the disease was clearly recognized as being progressive, patients received a standardized combination antibiotic therapy following hospitalization. In patients with substantial symptoms and/or advanced or progressive radiographic abnormalities, antibiotic therapy was initiated immediately. 8 Out of 248 patients with MAC lung disease, 121 patients (49%) did not receive antibiotic therapy, and 127 patients (51%) received combination antibiotic therapy by the end of September 2008. Of these 127 patients who initiated combination antibiotic therapy, 31 patients were excluded because they had received antibiotic therapy for less than 12 months at the time of analysis. These included MACunrelated death (n = 3), default (n = 12), transfer out (n = 5), and still on treatment (n = 11). However, 3 patients who died of MAC lung disease were included in the study, even though they were on less than 12 months of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, a total of 96 patients were included in the study. Permission was obtained from the institutional review board of Samsung Medical Center to review and publish information from the patients' records.

Samples positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were reviewed after staining by using the carbol fuchsin staining method. The results of smear microscopy were reported semiquantitatively. A positive smear was defined as one with > 1 AFB per 100 high-power fields. 9 Respiratory specimens were decontaminated using Nacetyl-L-cysteine/2% NaOH, and processed specimens were plated on 3% Ogawa medium (Shinyang, Seoul, Korea). Inoculated tubes were incubated at 37\u02daC and then inspected weekly for 8 weeks. All AFB isolates were assessed to distinguish between M. tuberculosis and NTM with a commercially available polymerase chain reactionbased assay system (MTB-ID, M&D Inc., Wonju, Korea). NTM species were identified using a polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods based on the rpoB gene, as described previously (Myco-ID, M&D Inc., Wonju, Korea). 2 Clarithromycin susceptibility was tested at the Korean Institute of Tuberculosis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of clarithromycin were determined using the broth microdilution method and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. 10 Isolates with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 32 \u00b5g/mL or greater were considered resistant. 10 Methods for determining broth microdilution minimal inhibitory concentration were not established in Korea during the early study period, therefore, isolates recovered from only 68 of 96 patients (71%) could be tested for susceptibility to clarithromycin.",

Treatment included oral clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol in combination with the aggressive use of intramuscular streptomycin during the initial treatment period. The overall favorable microbiologic response rate was 79% (76/96), and we found that a positive sputum AFB smear at the start of treatment was independently associated with an unfavorable microbiologic response. The optimal treatment regimen for MAC lung disease has yet to be fully established. 4,17 Field, et al. 5 published a comprehensive literature review of potential treatments for MAC lung disease. Overall, treatment outcomes have improved with the addition of macrolides to the standard regimen; however, the average culture conversion rate from 12 studies using the macrolide-containing regimen was only about 60%. 5 In our study, the favorable microbiologic response rate was 79%. This relatively high treatment response rate is comparable to data from previous studies in Japan. 18,19 In these Japanese studies, all patients received clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol daily, and 65-70% of patients were treated with an aminogly-coside such as streptomycin or kanamycin for the initial 2-6 months of therapy. In these studies, long-term conversion rates were more than 80% in patients infected with clarithromycin-susceptible strains. 18,19 The role of aminoglycoside as a companion drug is somewhat unclear. Streptomycin may be useful in patients who have a substantial number of extracellular organisms against which streptomycin is highly active. Included in this group are patients with radiographically extensive or cavitary disease and those with strongly positive sputum AFB smears. A recent prospective randomized controlled study of the clinical efficacy of streptomycin in the treatment of MAC lung disease revealed that sputum conversion rates at the completion of therapy were significantly higher in the streptomycin group who received streptomycin intramuscularly three times per week for the initial 3 months of therapy in combination with clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol. 16 In our study, streptomycin was given for a median of 4.5 months (IQR, 3-6 months) in 72 patients (75%). The use of this aggressive treatment strategy depended largely on the patients' characteristics. We used streptomycin in patients with a positive sputum smear and/or cavitary disease. Among the 96 patients, 66 (69%) had a positive AFB smear and 37 (39%) had a cavity (or cavities) visible on chest radiography at the start of antibiotic therapy.",

The decision is relatively easy in patients with profound symptoms and destructive lesions; however, the decision is difficult in patients with mild symptoms and non-advanced lesions. Factors that must be considered include the patients' age, whether the symptoms are mild or equivocal, and the presence of comorbities. 27 In all cases, close observation is necessary if treatment is not performed. There are few studies in which patients with certain characteristics show disease progression. One study from Japan found that 60% of patients showed disease progression and 40% of patients were stable during a mean observation period of 28 months. 28 In the present study, the conversion rate was significantly higher in smear-negative cases, suggesting that the earlier the treatment starts, the better the outcomes will be. However, prolonged antibiotic treatment may not be necessary in patients in the early stages of infection. This is a real challenge to clinicians in daily practice. Further studies are needed to determine when to start antibiotic therapy.",

We did not calculate appropriate power or sample size for this study at the design stage. Our restrospective study may have less power (less than 80%) to detect predictors of favorable responses if the expected proportion of favorable response was 0.2, and 95% of the patients with the favorable category of a predictor to favorable response resulted in favorable response, and the candidate predictors are not correlated. As observed therapy was not performed directly for patients with NTM lung disease, the possibility of poor compliance of treatment regimen could not be completely excluded in this retrospective study. In addition, the present study included patients with newly diagnosed MAC lung disease, and no patients were infected with clarithromycin-resistant MAC isolates. Therefore, our high treatment response rates may not be generalized to patients with a previous treatment history or those infected with clarithromycin-resistant isolates. Most importantly, we cannot determine whether a favorable microbiologic response will continue. Of the 76 patients who achieved culture-negative sputum for more than 12 months, 61 completed their antibiotic therapy and underwent follow-up for a median of only 6.5 months. Longer follow-up times are necessary to fully assess disease relapse over time.",
