To address this, we fused the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease to a peptide derived from the human Geminin protein (SpCas9-Gem) to facilitate its degradation during the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, when DNA repair by NHEJ predominates. We also use mRNA transfection to facilitate low and transient expression of modified and unmodified versions of Cas9. Although the frequency of homologous recombination was similar for SpCas9-Gem and SpCas9, we observed a marked reduction in the capacity for SpCas9-Gem to induce NHEJ-mediated indels at the target locus. Moreover, in contrast to native SpCas9, we demonstrate that transient SpCas9-Gem expression enables reliable generation of both knockin reporter cell lines and genetically repaired patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell lines free of unwanted mutations at the targeted locus.",

            "text": "The utility of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is significantly enhanced by an ability to precisely modify a chosen locus with minimal impact on the remaining genome. Ideally this is achieved by gene targeting, which historically has proved challenging in hPSCs due to the low frequency of homologous recombination (HR) (Zwaka and Thomson, 2003). More recently, genetic modification of hPSCs has been facilitated through the use of nucleases to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at a target locus, which are subsequently repaired by HR or the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. Zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like endonucleases (TALENs) were the first sequence-specific nucleases employed for gene targeting in hPSCs (Hockemeyer et al., 2009(Hockemeyer et al., , 2011Zou et al., 2009). However, both approaches require the design, expression, and validation of a new pair of proteins for every targeted locus, rendering both of these platforms time consuming and labor intensive. Due to its simplicity, ease of manipulation, and high efficiency, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system is fast becoming the preferred method for the precise modification of eukaryotic genomes (Cho et al., 2013;Cong et al., 2013;Jinek et al., 2012Jinek et al., , 2013Mali et al., 2013). However, a potential limitation to this system is the introduction of ''on-target'' disruptive mutations caused by Cas9-induced NHEJ occurring within the untargeted allele of knockin or gene-cor-rected hPSC clones (Howden et al., 2015;Merkle et al., 2015). Although reducing the Cas9 dosage may limit both off-target and on-target NHEJ activity (Cradick et al., 2013), a corresponding decrease in gene-targeting efficiency is also expected.",

Hence, controlling the presence of Cas9 protein during specific stages of the cell cycle could minimize the formation of undesirable insertion or deletion mutations (indels) induced by NHEJ. We hypothesized that the presence of Cas9 in G 1 would induce DNA DSBs that would invariably be repaired by error-prone NHEJ, whereas elimination of the nuclease within this phase could potentially limit the introduction of disruptive indels at the target locus.",

In this study, an identical Geminin-derived peptide was fused to SpCas9 (designated SpCas9-Gem) to facilitate nuclease degradation during G 1 . We show that the frequency of HR is not impaired by fusion of the Geminin peptide to SpCas9, but observe a significant decrease in NHEJ frequency, as evidenced by the absence of indels within the target locus. Together, these features of SpCas9-Gem permit efficient and reliable generation of both knockin cell lines and gene-corrected patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that are free of disruptive mutations within the untargeted allele.",

Because levels of Geminin and Cdt1 oscillate inversely, whereby Cdt1 levels are highest during G 1 and Geminin levels are highest during the S and G 2 phases (Nishitani et al., 2004;Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008), we also generated a second variant of SpCas9 (termed SpCas9-Cdt1) by fusing SpCas9 to amino acids 30-120 of Cdt1. Fusion of this peptide to fluorescent reporters has previously been shown to be sufficient for marking cells in G 1 (Pauklin and Vallier, 2013;Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008). An upstream T7 promoter was used for in vitro transcription of mRNA encoding SpCas9, SpCas9-Gem and SpCas9-Cdt1 ( Figure 1A). We performed intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis following transfection of mRNA encoding each of the Cas9 variants in the human embryonic stem cell line, H9, to examine their abundance and stability over time. Prior to analysis, cells were incubated in the presence of Hoechst 33342 to distinguish cells in G 0 /G 1 and S/G 2 phases of the cell cycle. Although at 6 hr post transfection all three Cas9 variants were present at similar levels, by 18 hr post transfection a marked reduction in both SpCas9-Gem and SpCas9-Cdt1 abundance was observed relative to native SpCas9 ( Figure 1B). Furthermore, at both time points SpCas9-Gem appeared to be expressed at higher levels in the S/G 2 subpopulation, which was not observed for the native SpCas9 or SpCas9-Cdt1 variant. Although significant expression of SpCas9-Gem in the G 0 /G 1 subpopulation was also noted, we hypothesized that this could be  Figure 1.

As in the previous study, we chose to target the DNMT3B gene with an EGFP reporter (Figure 2A), since DNMT3B is highly expressed in pluripotent cells and quickly downregulated following differentiation, allowing targeted iPSC colonies to be easily identified by fluorescent microscopy ( Figure 2B) and flow cytometry ( Figure 2C). Episomal reprogramming vectors, a plasmid encoding a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) specific to sequence spanning the DNMT3B start codon and a plasmid encoding an EGFP reporter flanked by 1.1 kb and 0.7 kb and homology arms specific to sequences upstream and downstream of the DNMT3B start codon (Figure 2A) were co-transfected with mRNA encoding SpCas9, SpCas9-Gem, or SpCas9-Cdt1. No observable difference in cell viability was associated with transfection of mRNA encoding SpCas9-Gem or SpCas9-Cdt1 compared with the native SpCas9 (Figure S1A). To estimate targeting efficiency associated with each of the Cas9 variants, we passaged cells approximately 3 weeks post transfection using EDTA to selectively remove residual fibroblasts from iPSCs (Howden et al., 2015). After three passages the total cell population was analyzed by flow cytometry. As measured by the number of EGFP-expressing cells, targeting efficiency was comparable for both the SpCas9 and SpCas9-Gem variants (17.1% versus 16.5%) but slightly lower for the SpCas9-Cdt1 variant (9.9%) ( Figure 2C). We did not observe any EGFP-expressing cells when Cas9 mRNA was omitted from the transfection (data not shown). At 2-3 weeks post transfection, randomly selected EGFP-expressing and EGFP non-expressing (EGFP neg ) colonies were picked and expanded for further analysis ( Figure 2B and Table 1). EGFP-expressing clones were further categorized as either having a single allele (EGFP + ) or both DNMT3B alleles (EGFP ++ ) targeted, based on flow cytometry and PCR analysis (Figures 2D and S1). Of 28 EGFP-expressing clones isolated from transfections performed with SpCas9 or SpCas9-Gem mRNA, we observed 11 (39%) and 6 (21%) EGFP ++ clones, respectively ( Table 1). The SpCas9-Cdt1 variant resulted in only a single (6%) EGFP ++ clone out of 17 clones analyzed. Next we analyzed the untargeted allele of single-targeted EGFP + clones by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product amplified from genomic DNA using primers flanking the DNMT3B start codon ( Figure 2D). With respect to unmodified SpCas9, NHEJ activity could be detected within the untargeted allele in all 17 clones analyzed ( Figure 2E), as evidenced by the presence of indels ranging from 1 bp to over 1 kb in size (Table S1). In contrast, of 22 clones analyzed, we identified 8 (36%) ''indel-free'' clones derived using the SpCas9-Gem variant, which did not contain mutations within the untargeted DNMT3B allele. Interestingly, indel-free clones could also be generated with the SpCas9-Cdt1 variant, albeit with a lower efficiency (2 out of 16 EGFP + clones [12%] analyzed). We next investigated the NHEJ activity associated with each of the Cas9 variants in EGFP neg clones, again by analysis of PCR amplicons encompassing the DNMT3B start codon and surrounding sequence. Sequencing analysis revealed indels in all 25 EGFP neg clones expanded and analyzed from experiments performed with SpCas9, with all but one clone carrying disruptions in both DNMT3B alleles ( Figure 2F and Table S2). Mutations in DNMT3B could also be found in the vast majority (95%) of EGFP neg clones isolated and expanded from experiments performed using SpCas9-Cdt1 mRNA; however, approximately half of these had only one allele disrupted by NHEJ with the other allele remaining intact. Conversely, only 35% of EGFP neg clones generated with the SpCas9-Gem variant contained mutations in DNMT3B, with single allele and biallelic disruption in 13% and 22% of EGFP neg clones, respectively.",

To demonstrate this, we chose to correct an autosomal dominant G > A transition (R853Q) in exon 14 of the SCN2A gene identified in a pediatric patient with severe epilepsy. We attempted to simultaneously reprogram and correct the disease-causing mutation in the patient fibroblasts using our one-step protocol and mRNA encoding SpCas9, SpCas9-Gem, or SpCas9-Cdt1. To facilitate gene repair we used an sgRNA encompassing the patient-specific mutation and a plasmid encoding wild-type SCN2A sequence, comprising z0.9-kb arms flanking the intended DNA DSB. A silent 3-bp change was also included to aid in identification of correctly modified clones and to minimize Cas9 recutting following HR with the homologous template ( Figure 3A). To assess HR and NHEJ activities, we extracted genomic DNA from randomly selected iPSC colonies, followed by sequencing analysis of the PCR product amplified using primers flank-ing exon 14 of SCN2A. With respect to the SpCas9-Gem variant, gene repair was observed in 5 of 30 clones (17%) screened, as evidenced by the loss of the disease-causing mutation and gain of the 3-bp synonymous change carried by the corrective plasmid ( Figures 3B and 3C).

Targeted correction of SCN2A was also observed with the SpCas9 and SpCas9-Cdt1 variants, although at a lower frequency (9.7% and 3.3%, respectively). Furthermore, only one gene-corrected clone out of 31 (3.3%) iPSC colonies screened for both the SpCas9 and SpCas9-Cdt1 variants did not contain a secondary mutation at the other SCN2A allele. As seen in the previous DNMT3B targeting experiment, sequencing analysis of uncorrected iPSC clones revealed a much lower incidence of NHEJ associated with the SpCas9-Gem variant compared with unmodified SpCas9 and the SpCas9-Cdt1 variant ( Figure 3D). Although our sgRNA was designed to recognize the mutant over wild-type SCN2A allele, indels could be detected in both alleles for each of the Cas9 variants tested. This is not unexpected, since single mismatches in sgRNA are often well tolerated, even within the 3 0 end of the protospacer sequence (Fu et al., 2013;Hsu et al., 2013). However, analysis of all clones with only a single allele disrupted by NHEJ did reveal a preference for the mutant allele (Figure 3D and Table S3).",

            "text": "To evaluate the SpCas9-Gem variant in a cell type other than human fibroblasts, we utilized iPSC lines generated in the previous experiments (see Figure S1) that harbor EGFP targeted to both DNMT3B alleles. For a homologous template we used a plasmid encoding the full-length BFP sequence that was identical to EGFP except for C > G and T > C transitions, corresponding to two consecutive amino acid changes (T67S and Y68H) ( Figure 4A). This is sufficient for conversion of EGFP to BFP reporter expression (Glaser et al., 2016). We also included a plasmid encoding an sgRNA that specifically recognizes EGFP over BFP. Using this system in an iPSC line constitutively expressing EGFP, we simultaneously estimated both HR (as determined by the number of BFP + cells) and NHEJ frequencies (as determined by the number of EGFP neg cells) in the total population of transfected cells after 3 days by flow cytometry ( Figure 4B). SpCas9 or SpCas9-Gem mRNA resulted in similar levels of HR, as determined by the number of BFP + cells, when co-transfected with BFP plasmid DNA and EGFP-specific sgRNA into two independent EGFP ++ iPSC lines ( Figures 4B and 4C). However, a significantly reduced proportion of EGFP neg cells, caused by disruption of the EGFP gene, was consistently associated with the SpCas9-Gem variant. This approximately 2-fold reduction in NHEJ activity was observed in both the presence and absence of the BFP donor template ( Figure 4C). To determine whether simply lowering the nuclease dosage could also achieve reduced indel formation while maintaining HR efficiency, we co-transfected 50, 100, 250, or 500 ng of mRNA encoding SpCas9 with the BFP plasmid and EGFP-specific sgRNA plasmid into iPSCs constitutively expressing EGFP. In agreement with previous studies, lower concentrations of Cas9 did indeed reduce NHEJ frequency, although a consequential decrease in HR efficiency was also observed. Specifically, the lowest dose of SpCas9 mRNA (50 ng) reduced NHEJ to rates observed with 500 ng of the SpCas9-Gem mRNA but resulted in more than 5-fold reduction in HR frequency ( Figure S2A). A positive correlation between Cas9 mRNA concentration and HR efficiency was also observed when targeting EGFP to the DNMT3B locus in H9 cells ( Figure S2B). Furthermore, no significant difference in targeting efficiency was observed following co-transfection of mRNA encoding SpCas9 or SpCas9-Gem with the DNMT3B-EGFP homologous template and DNMT3B-specific sgRNA in H9 cells ( Figure S3A). We also evaluated the ''on-target'' indel frequency of the SpCas9-Gem variant following targeting of the DNMT3B and GAPDH loci in H9 cells. In these experiments, we used targeting constructs that contain a drug-selectable marker to facilitate rapid isolation, expansion, and characterization of individual colonies ( Figures S3B and S3C). Consistent with the EGFP-to-BFP conversion assay in the previous experiments, an approximately 2-to 3-fold reduction in NHEJ activity was associated with the SpCas9-Gem variant compared with native SpCas9.",

            "text": "deleterious mutations has been somewhat elusive. Because cell-cycle phase largely determines the frequency of the alternative HR and NHEJ DNA repair pathways, it is reasonable to expect that controlling the timing of a DNA DSB may selectively favor one pathway over the other. Chemical-mediated cell synchronization followed by timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complexes has recently been shown to be effective for increasing HR efficiency in the human cell line HEK-293, although whether this led to decreased NHEJ activity in alleles that had not undergone HR was not reported (Lin et al., 2014). Moreover, different cell types, such as hPSCs, have distinct requirements for synchronization, which do not always translate to effective increases in HR. Recent studies have also shown that small molecules such as SCR7 may inhibit NHEJ and consequently promote HR (Maruyama et al., 2015). However, these kinds of approaches are likely to have variable effects across different cell types and may potentially exhibit undesirable cytotoxic effects, rendering them unsuitable in therapeutic contexts. In an attempt to address some of these issues, we generated a variant of the SpCas9 nuclease (SpCas9-Gem) that persists during stages of the cell cycle when the HR pathway is active, but is degraded during G 1 , when NHEJ activity predominates. An attractive feature of the SpCas9-Gem variant is its potential applicability to different cell types without a requirement for cells to be manipulated or specially prepared prior to introduction of the gene-editing factors. In the current study we have demonstrated the versatility of SpCas9-Gem in primary human fibroblasts and hPSCs, two cell types known to exhibit very different cell-cycle profiles. Although the lower frequency of NHEJ associated with SpCas9-Gem was less pronounced in hPSCs, we hypothesize that this may be attributed to the dramatically  shorter G 0 /G 1 phase that is characteristic of hPSCs, compared with somatic cell types such as fibroblasts. While this manuscript was in preparation, Gutschner et al. (2016) also described a version of SpCas9 fused to the N-terminal region of human Geminin. Although the authors reported a modest increase (28%-87%) in HR compared with unmodified SpCas9 in HEK293T cells, their Cas9-Geminin fusion provoked similar levels of indel formation. This may be explained by their use of plasmid DNA to express Cas9 from a b-actin promoter, resulting in sustained levels of nuclease transcription that likely persists over several days and during the course of multiple cycles of cell division. In the study presented here, transfection of in vitro transcribed mRNA was utilized, enabling uniform and transient expression of SpCas9-Gem protein during S/G 2 . Following degradation during G 1 , nuclease levels are drastically reduced, even in subsequent S/G 2 phases, which can most likely be attributed to the transient and unstable properties of mRNA.",

Although this may be due to the fact that proteins fused to the Cdt1 peptide can persist during the initial stages of S phase, when HR becomes a potential option for DNA repair, this may also be the result of incomplete degradation of SpCas9-Cdt1 during S/G 2 /M (see Figure 1).

It is difficult to determine whether this is due to lower overall levels of SpCas9-Cdt1 or perhaps a reduced nuclease activity relative to unmodified SpCas9. Although any off-target effects associated with the Cas9 variants generated in this study were not analyzed, the lower NHEJ activity of SpCas9-Gem would likely translate to a reduction in unwanted mutations across the genome. Nonetheless, the incorporation of the Geminin peptide into the recently described high-fidelity versions of SpCas9 (SpCas9-HF1 and eCas9) (Kleinstiver et al., 2016;Slaymaker et al., 2016) may reduce the likelihood of off-target NHEJ further.",

This is a significant advance in the downstream application of hPSCs for disease modeling and functional genomics, and prepares the field for gene-correction applications in regenerative medicine.

The SpCas9-Gem variant was generated by PCR-amplifying sequence from hCas9 using ODNs 1 and 2 and sequence from pTRE-CellCycle (Clontech) using ODNs 3 and 4 followed by insertion into the EcoRI and AgeI restriction sites in pDNR-SpCas9. The pSpCas9-CdtI variant was generated by PCRamplifying sequence from hCas9 using ODNs 1 and 2 and sequence from pTRE-CellCycle (Clontech) using ODNs 3 and 5 followed by insertion into the EcoRI and AgeI restriction sites in pDNR-SpCas9. For construction of the DNMT3B targeting vector, a gBlock encoding 5 0 BglII and NdeI sites, nucleotides 150-724 of the EGFP gene, an SV40 polyA signal, and 700 bp of sequence beginning at the DNMT3B start codon was cloned into the HincII site of the pSMARTHCKan plasmid vector (Lucigen). ODNs 6 and 7 were used to PCR amplify (from a previously generated BAC clone carrying an EGFP reporter inserted at the DNMT3B start codon) a DNA fragment carrying an approximately 1.1-kb sequence upstream of the DNMT3B start codon and the first 150 bp of EGFP, which was subsequently inserted into the BglII and NdeI sites of the plasmid described above. A plasmid designed for insertion and expression of sgRNA sequences was constructed by inserting a gBlock encoding a U6 promoter, two BbsI sites, and SpCas9-specific tracrRNA sequence into the HincII site of pSMARTHCKan. ODNs specific to each target locus were annealed and inserted into the BbsI sites of the pSMART-sgRNA vector. For repair of the patient-specific mutation, two gBlocks encoding a total of 1750 bp of the SCN2A gene was inserted into the AatII and EcoRI sites of the pDNR-Dual vector. A serine residue within the region recognized by our SCN2A-specific sgRNA was changed from TCA to AGT to minimize Cas9-induced cutting of the plasmid following its introduction into cells. A BFP targeting vector was generated by inserting a gBlock encoding the full-length BFP gene into the AatII and EcoRI sites of pDNR-Dual. The DNMT3B gene-targeting construct containing the EGFP and puromycin resistance genes was generated as previously described (Howden et al., 2015).
