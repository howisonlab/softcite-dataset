            "text": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major cause of severe central vision loss in patients with exudative, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) [1]. In patients with exudative AMD, choroidal blood vessels grow through Bruch's membrane into the subretinal space. This is followed by leakage and accumulation of serum or blood beneath the RPE, leading to retinal damage and rapid loss of vision [2]. Human ocular neovascularization may be caused or facilitated by altered expression of integrins [3,4]. Integrins are heterodimeric, cell surface receptors found in nearly all metazoan cell types. These receptors are composed of noncovalently linked \u03b1-and \u03b2-subunits [5,6]. In mammals, 18 \u03b1-subunits and eight \u03b2-subunits have been identified [7]. The subunit composition of the heterodimer determines binding to specific ligands in the extracellular matrix (ECM). For example, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins bind to their ligands fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN), respectively, which are strongly expressed around developing vasculature [5,8,9]. Therefore, \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins have been investigated the most as potential regulators of angiogenesis [10]. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 was the first integrin associated with angiogenesis [11], and deletion of the \u03b15 gene is embryonically lethal with vascular and cardiac defects [12]. These integrin-mediated interactions are also required for pathological processes such as angiogenesis [13], tumor survival, and metastasis [14].",

            "text": "Laser irradiation encircling the optic nerve is widely used for inducing CNV in rodent [15] and primate [16] models of AMD. During experimental choroidal neovascularization, the binding of inhibitors to integrins \u03b15 and \u03b1v is antiangiogenic. For example, systemic administration of \u03b15\u03b21 integrin antagonist causes CNV suppression and regression [17]. An \u03b1v\u03b23 specific antagonist also inhibits laser-induced CNV in mice [18]. However, the expression of integrin \u03b15 and \u03b1v subunits with time is limited in these models, and the localization of integrin ligands such as FN and VN has not been reported. Thus, the purposes of the present study in the laser-induced CNV model were as follows: 1) to identify integrin \u03b1 chainpositive cells and their ligands FN and VN and 2) to measure the binding of integrins to their ligand ECMs. Laser-induced choroidal neovascularization model: Rats were anesthetized with a 1 ml/kg bodyweight intraperitoneal injection of a mixture containing ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/ml; Daiichi Sankyo, Tokyo, Japan) and xylazine hydrochloride (10 mg/ml; Bayer, Tokyo, Japan). Pupils were dilated with topical tropicamide/phenylephrine (Midrin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan). Visualization of the fundus was aided by placing a cover glass on the eye over hydroxyethylcellulose. A slit-lamp biomicroscope (NIDEK, Aichi, Japan) was used to encircle the optic nerve on the retina with six to seven laser spots (100 \u00b5m each, 532 nm, 150 mW, 0.1 s). Breakage of Bruch's membrane was confirmed by bubble formation and used as an end point for treatment. Animals with severe hemorrhages in the retina were excluded from the study. Two rat eyes in the experimental group were choroidal flatmounted and subjected to immunohistochemistry as described below.",

            "text": "The major finding of the present studies was the sequence of molecular events that occur during the onset and development of neovascularization in the laser-induced CNV model in rats ( Table 1). The first major event observed 1 day after laser treatment was the accumulation of FN and VN between the subretinal space and sclera around the injured areas ( Figure  4). mRNA specific for FN is transiently increased by the terminal complement proteins C5b-8 and C5b-9 in glomerular mesangial cells [20]. VN also increases in complementstimulated human RPE cells [21]. The end product of complement activation, membrane attack complex (MAC), increases as early as 1 h after laser treatment [22]. Thus, complement activation could be a mechanism for the early expression of FN and VN in our laser model. On day 3, binding of antibodies for integrins \u03b15 and \u03b1v and for FITC-labeled isolectin (for macrophages and microglial, perivascular, and endothelial cells) increased markedly (Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4). Increased chemokine, (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), causes migration and accumulation of microglia and macrophages for uptake of cell debris [22,23]. mRNA for CCL2 peaks at 12 h within laser-injury spots [22]. In addition, mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) increases 2 days after laser treatment [22], and VEGF is secreted from macrophages and microglial and RPE cells [24]. Specific adherence of retinal endothelial cells, where integrins \u03b15 and \u03b1v were expressed (confirmed with western blotting, data not shown), to FN and VN through integrin \u03b15 and \u03b1v was also observed ( Figure  5). These data suggest that under the influence of cytokines, such as CCL2 and VEGF, integrin \u03b15-and \u03b1v-positive macrophages and microglial and endothelial cells migrated between the subretinal and suprachoroidal spaces with ruptured Bruch's membranes. This is also where FN and VN, the specific ligands for integrins \u03b15 and \u03b1v, accumulated. These data suggest that the increased FN and VN in laser injury may be important for the accumulation of integrin \u03b15-and \u03b1v-positive cells. This was followed by uptake of cell debris by the macrophages and microglia and neovascularization by the endothelial cells.",
