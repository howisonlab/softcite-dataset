            "text": "Background: Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilage-forming tumours of bone. Because of their resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, currently no treatment strategies exist for unresectable and metastatic chondrosarcoma. Previously, PI3K/AKT/GSK3b and Src kinase pathways were shown to be activated in chondrosarcoma cell lines. Our aim was to investigate the role of these kinases in chemoresistance and migration in chondrosarcoma in relation to TP53 mutation status. Methods: We used five conventional and three dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma cell lines and investigated the effect of PI3K/AKT/GSK3b pathway inhibition (enzastaurin) and Src pathway inhibition (dasatinib) in chemoresistance using WST assay and live cell imaging with AnnexinV staining. Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 157 cartilaginous tumours was performed for Src family members. Migration assays were performed with the RTCA xCelligence System. Results: Src inhibition was found to overcome chemoresistance, to induce apoptosis and to inhibit migration. Cell lines with TP53 mutations responded better to combination therapy than wild-type cell lines (P \u00bc 0.002). Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry confirmed active Src (pSrc) signalling, with Fyn being most abundantly expressed (76.1%). Conclusion: These results strongly indicate Src family kinases, in particular Fyn, as a potential target for the treatment of inoperable and metastatic chondrosarcomas, and to sensitise for doxorubicin especially in the presence of TP53 mutations."

Metastasis formation eventually occurs in 71% of grade III chondrosarcoma cases, and with a 10-year survival rate of 29%, this poses a serious treatment problem (Evans et al, 1977).",

In the search for molecular targets, negative regulators of the apoptotic pathway, such as BCL-2 (Bov\u00e9e et al, 2000;Hameetman et al, 2005;Rozeman et al, 2005;Soderstrom et al, 2010) and survivin (Lechler et al, 2011), were identified to be upregulated in chondrosarcoma, and shown to have a role in chemoresistance (Lechler et al, 2011;van Oosterwijk et al, 2012a).",

Activation of the Src pathway promotes cell survival, proliferation and migration, but can also activate the PI3K/AKT/GSK3b pathway through phosphorylation of PI3K, thereby leading to increased AKT phosphorylation (Johnson et al, 2000). Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by RTKs can also activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, either through phosphorylation of PI3K or through direct phosphorylation of AKT (Aeder et al, 2004;Kawakami et al, 2004; Figure 1A).

To investigate the PI3K/AKT/ GSK3b pathway, chondrosarcoma cells were treated with 1 mM and 10 mM enzastaurin (Faul et al, 2003), a PKCb inhibitor shown to inhibit AKT signalling and GSK3b phosphorylation (Graff et al, 2005). Whereas the cervical cancer cell line HeLa shows 70% reduction in cell viability after treatment with 10 mM enzastaurin ( Figure 1B), chondrosarcoma cell lines were less sensitive to enzastaurin treatment. Two chondrosarcoma cell lines showed complete resistance (NDCS-1 and L2975), whereas in the two most responsive cell lines (SW1353 and L3252) a maximum reduction in cell viability of B40% was achieved ( Figure 1B). As the PI3K/AKT/ GSK3b pathway is involved in cell survival, we set out to examine its role in chemoresistance. Enzastaurin was combined with doxorubicin over the course of 72 h, alternating treatments every 24 h, as we previously showed that drug administration on separate days was most effective (van Oosterwijk et al, 2012b). While there was no difference in response between IDH-mutated and IDH wild-type cell lines, cell lines with TP53 mutations responded better to combination treatment than TP53 wild-type cell lines (P \u00bc 0.002; Figure 1B). However, a lack of synergy between the two drugs was observed (combination indices 42), as reduction in cell viability was attributed to the effect of doxorubicin alone (NDCS-1) or the additive effect of enzastaurin and doxorubicin. Activation of AKT1 can be through mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain, found mostly in solid tumours (Mahajan and Mahajan, 2012), leading to activated downstream signalling and decreased sensitivity to kinase inhibitors (Carpten et al, 2007). Hotspot mutations in the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT1 were absent in the primary chondrosarcoma tumour tissues or cell lines.",

We have previously shown Src signalling to be involved in chondrosarcoma cell proliferation (Schrage et al, 2009). Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of phosphorylated Src (Y418) in the chondrosarcoma cell lines, with lowest expression in  L835 cells, and 24 h with 1 mM dasatinib resulted in decreased pSrc levels (Figure 2A). To examine the role of Src signalling in chemoresistance, dasatinib was combined with doxorubicin. A synergistic effect was observed in cell lines CH2879, OUMS27, SW1353, JJ012, NDCS-1 and L2975 (combination indices ranging from 0.09 to 0.88; Figure 2C), and the order of drug administration did not influence efficacy. Interestingly, a significant difference between both the cell viability (P \u00bc 0.002) and the combination    indices (P \u00bc 0.043) was observed between cell lines with and without TP53 mutations, and both cell lines that were resistant to combination treatment (L835 and L3252) were wild type for TP53 mutations. We continued to investigate p53 accumulation as well as MDM2 and p21 expression in cells treated with and without treatment with dasatinib ( Figure 2B). As expected, high p53 protein expression with low to absent p21was seen in the three TP53 mutant cell lines. All TP53 wild-type cell lines demonstrated low p53 and p21 protein expression with the exception of CH2879, demonstrating high levels of p53 and p21. Protein levels were not affected by dasatinib treatment. All cell lines showed low MDM2 protein expression.",

During the staining procedures, some cores were lost due to inherent structural instability of the tissue. A significant increase in Src expression was seen between grade I and grade II peripheral CS (P \u00bc 0.005, Pearson chi-squared test). Though not significant, Src expression in tumours was found to be inversely correlated with overall survival (P \u00bc 0.3, log rank). Fyn expression was found to significantly increase with increasing histological grade in both peripheral chondrosarcoma (P \u00bc 0.05 Pearson chi-squared test) and central chondrosarcoma (P \u00bc 0.000, Pearson chi-squared test). No significant correlations to metastasis were found. Using western blot, we confirmed expression of Fyn in all cell lines, with low expression in L835 (Figure 2A).",

Despite ongoing research, there is still nothing to offer patients with unresectable or metastatic disease and the need for new, targeted therapies is high. We here explored the effects of increased PI3K/AKT/GSK3b and Src signalling on chondrosarcoma chemoresistance and cell migration using enzastaurin and dasatinib, respectively. We show that dasatinib is more effective in overcoming chondrosarcoma chemoresistance than enzastaurin, and acts synergistically with doxorubicin to inhibit cell viability and induce apoptosis. Most importantly, we show that in cell lines with TP53 mutations, the combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with doxorubicin is more beneficial than in wild-type TP53 cell lines. Chondrosarcoma is a heterogeneous disease, and this heterogeneity is represented in the cell lines. Recently, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were found in chondrosarcoma (Amary et al, 2011), and we published that these mutations are retained in chondrosarcoma cell lines (Pansuriya et al, 2011;van Oosterwijk et al, 2012a). Of the two cell lines that were non-responsive to combination treatment of doxorubicin with dasatinib, one central chondrosarcoma cell line (L835) carried an IDH1 mutation, whereas the other (dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma cell line (L3252)) was wild type for IDH. Thus, no correlation between IDH mutation status and response to dasatinib monotreatment or combination treatment with doxorubicin was observed. More likely, the lack of sensitivity to dasatinib in the L835 cell line is caused by the low pSrc activity in this cell line.",

            "text": "Src inhibition with dasatinib resulted in successful sensitisation for doxorubicin treatment, especially in TP53 mutant chondrosarcoma cell lines. Approximately 30% of chondrosarcomas carry TP53 mutations, and these mutations are found especially in highgrade chondrosarcomas (Oshiro et al, 1998;Terek et al, 1998). Three of the eight cell lines carry a TP53 mutation (SW1353, JJ012 and NDCS-1), and these cell lines also showed a better response to combination treatment with low combination indices when compared with TP53 wild-type cell lines. This is an interesting result as mutant TP53 is described to actively inhibit apoptosis through activation of p21 (Donzelli et al, 2012) or to confer chemoresistance through engaging in oncogenic transcription complexes (Huang et al, 2012). Previously, dasatinib was found to interfere with the p53 transcriptional activity induced by the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3 (Zauli et al, 2011). We show that dasatinib does not affect p53 nor p21 protein expression in chondrosarcoma cells. Dasatinib as a single agent proved ineffective in chondrosarcoma patients (Schuetze et al, 2010). However, recent clinical studies with dasatinib in other malignancies have shown its efficacy not only irrespective of TP53 status as a single agent (Bosco et al, 2012) but also to overcome TP53 mutation status-related chemoresistance (Amrein et al, 2008). The results of these clinical studies in combination with the data we show here strongly suggest clinical evaluation of the efficacy of dasatinib in combination with doxorubicin in chondrosarcoma patients harbouring TP53 mutations.",

Fyn was most widely expressed (89 out of 117) and was found to increase with increasing histological grade, suggesting a role in chondrosarcoma progression. Fyn is reported to be upregulated in multiple cancers, and to be associated with malignant progression and metastasis formation (Posadas et al, 2009;Chen et al, 2010;Saito et al, 2010). We confirmed that indeed the Src pathway is important in chondrosarcoma cell motility, as dasatinib completely inhibited migratory capacity of all chondrosarcoma cell lines even at low dose.",

            "text": "Both the PI3K/AKT/GSK3b and Src kinase pathways are activated by RTKs (Goode et al, 1992;Wheeler et al, 2009), and have diverse roles in promoting growth, survival and metastasis (Aligayer et al, 2002;Wheeler et al, 2009;Yang et al, 2010;McNamara and Degterev, 2011;Saini et al, 2011). We show here that constitutive activation of AKT due to mutations does not have a role in chondrosarcoma, and further research should elucidate which RTK is responsible for the high AKT, GSK3b and Src phosphorylation (Schrage et al, 2009). A possible candidate is IGF-1, which can activate the PI3K/AKT and Src pathway through the RTK IGF-1R (Grimberg, 2003), and has been shown to induce PI3K/AKT signalling and migration in chondrosarcoma cell lines (Wu et al, 2011). Src family kinases can induce phosphorylation of the RTK domains of IGF-1 as well as the PDGF receptors through SHP-2 leading to receptor internalisation. This increases binding efficacy with PI3K, leading to increased proliferative capacity of cancer cells (Wu et al, 2001;Carver et al, 2010). Moreover, AKT functions as a gatekeeper of apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD. AKT-mediated phosphorylation of BAD inhibits its binding capacity to antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members, which will prevent a cell from entering apoptosis (Gilmore et al, 2002;Maddika et al, 2007). We recently published that the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members also have a role in chondrosarcoma chemoresistance (van Oosterwijk et al, 2012b). Combined with the results of the present study, this is suggestive of a common mechanism. However, more studies are needed to explore whether the activation of the IGF pathway by Src leading to the inhibition of BH3 proteins and apoptosis through AKT may be involved in chondrosarcoma chemoresistance.",
