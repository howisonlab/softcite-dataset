            "text": "It is recognised that ovarian factors, including steroid and protein hormones, are critical in the feedback regulation of pituitary gonadotropins; however, their individual contributions are less defined. The aim of this study was to explore the reciprocal relationships between ovarian and pituitary hormones across the normal ovulatory menstrual cycle as women age. FSH, LH, oestradiol, progesterone, inhibin A, inhibin B and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) were measured in serum collected every 1-3 days across one interovulatory interval (IOI) from 26 healthy women aged 18-50 years. The antral follicle count (AFC) for follicles 2-5 mm, >6 mm and 2-10 mm were tabulated across the IOI. Independent associations between ovarian hormones/AFC vs pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) were investigated using multivariate regression analysis. The data were sub-grouped based on the presence or absence luteal phase-dominant follicles (LPDF). Serum oestradiol and AMH were inversely correlated with FSH in both follicular and luteal phases. Inhibin B correlated inversely with FSH and LH in the late follicular phase and directly in the luteal phase. AFC, inhibin A and progesterone were not key predictors of either FSH or LH. The strong association between AMH and FSH with age implies that AMH, as well as oestradiol and inhibin B are important regulators of FSH. The change in feedback response of inhibin B with both FSH and LH across the cycle suggests two phases of the negative feedback. hormones, inhibin A and B. However, their respective roles are not clearly understood. In a previous study ((2), and (3) designated in this article as the 2009 study), attempts were made to identify the key ovarian hormone factors that are responsible for the feedback regulation of pituitary FSH and LH in",

            "text": "It is well recognised that ovarian hormones exert a strong inhibitory effect on the pituitary secretion of FSH and LH, as reflected by a 6-to 12-fold increase in the human pituitary secretion of FSH and LH after ovariectomy (1). The key ovarian factors believed responsible are the steroids, oestradiol and progesterone, and the protein women by exploring their independent associations using a multivariate regression analysis. This study consisted of 76 asymptomatic women aged between 21 and 55 years investigated over one complete menstrual cycle. Serum FSH, LH, oestradiol, progesterone, inhibin A, inhibin B and AMH were measured every 3 days across the cycle. The data were then analysed across the follicular and luteal phases. The results indicated that in the follicular phase, both inhibin B and AMH were inversely associated with FSH and inhibin B with LH. In comparison, in the luteal phase, oestradiol and progesterone were inversely associated with both serum FSH and LH. There appeared to be a 3-day lagged response between inhibin B and FSH. The apparent inverse relationships between ovarian and pituitary hormones were surprising as there is little evidence to support many of these roles, particularly AMH as feedback regulators of FSH and LH.",

            "text": "A number of questions arose from this study: (a) Is the close association between AMH and FSH due to the possibility that AMH may directly regulate FSH or act as a proxy for another ovarian factor (perhaps unknown)? Would the association between AMH and FSH weaken if follicle size and number were included as factors in the analysis? (b) The AMH ELISA used in the 2009 study had limited sensitivity and was only able to detect serum AMH in 36% of advanced reproductive aged women. Would the availability of more sensitive AMH ELISAs (reported to detect AMH in >95% of samples, (4)) provide a more complete AMH data set? (c) To what extent does the presence of hormonesecreting luteal phase-dominant follicles (LPDFs) influence feedback relationships between ovarian and pituitary hormones? It has been previously shown (5,6) that there are 2-3 follicular waves across each interovulatory interval (IOI). A dominant follicle (i.e., \u226510 mm) may develop from any of the waves that emerge during the IOI. In women of reproductive age, only one wave of the IOI has been shown to result in ovulation. In comparison, as women approach menopause, the waves preceding the late follicular phase ovulatory wave of the IOI can result in the development of luteal phase-dominant follicles (LPDFs, \u226510 mm), which may regress or ovulate. In older women, LPDFs grow larger over a longer period of time, in some cases extending into the subsequent follicular phase.",

In brief, healthy women (aged 18-50, n = 26) with ovulatory menstrual cycles were recruited for this study. Selection criteria and ethics approvals were outlined previously (7). Blood samples were collected every 1-3 days over one IOI. An IOI was defined as the time interval from one ovulation to the subsequent ovulation. Sera were assayed for FSH, LH, oestradiol, progesterone, inhibin A, inhibin B and AMH. AMH was assayed using two different ELISAs: AMH-Gen-II (Beckman Coulter, Chaska, USA) and AMH 24/32 (Anshlabs, Webster, Texas, USA (4)). The AMH 24/32 ELISA is a much more sensitive assay compared to AMH-Gen-II ELISA, enabling the detection of serum AMH in women of advanced reproductive age. The AFC for 3 different diameter categories (i.e., AFC 2-5 mm, 2-10 mm and \u22656 mm) was quantified using serial transvaginal ultrasonography every 1-3 days across the IOI as previously described (7).",

This observation was surprising and provided the impetus for the present analysis. The inclusion of a more-sensitive AMH ELISA was intended to establish a more reliable set of AMH values, particularly in the lower ranges. The inclusion of AFC for follicles of various diameters was to establish if AMH was a proxy or substitute for another AFC factor based on the very high correlation between serum AMH and AFC (4). The inclusion of AFC did not change the independent inverse association of AMH and FSH. There is limited evidence available to substantiate any postulated age-related feedback role of AMH on FSH. AMH has been shown to inhibit FSH\u03b2 subunit synthesis in a mouse anterior pituitary (L\u03b2T2) cell line and rat pituitary cells in vitro (9); presumably, this is likely although not yet shown in the human pituitary. By comparison, there is no evidence that FSH stimulates AMH synthesis by the ovary (10), a key component in any ovarian:pituitary negative feedback mechanism. AMH is produced by granulosa cells from gonadotropin-unresponsive preantral follicles under stimulation by oocyte-specific factors (e.g. BMP2, 6, 7, 15, GDF9) from the oocyte (11,12). AMH has been shown to inhibit the progression of primordial to preantral follicles (13,14,15) in mice but stimulates progression in primate monkeys (16). AMH has been shown to inhibit FSH-induced oestradiol production by human and primate granulosa cells (16,17,18,19,20). Moreover, oestradiol has been shown to inhibit AMH synthesis in vitro suggesting an indirect action of FSH on AMH synthesis (20).",

Oestradiol is thought to exert an inhibitory role on FSH, whereas the reduced AMH levels may lead to elevated FSH levels. It would appear that if oestradiol and AMH are two of the major factors in regulating FSH, the effects of AMH are more pronounced with age. It is recognised that as oestradiol exerts its inhibitory role at the hypothalamus, whereas AMH is probably at the pituitary, different biological actions are likely involved. AMH and oestradiol have been shown to be reciprocally related in follicular fluid (15,21,22).",

However, with the exception of Pigny (26), these analyses did not differentiate AMH's role from the effects of other ovarian feedback factors. The studies of Pigny (26) investigated the feedback relationship between AMH and FSH in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) where serum AMH levels were elevated. A significant inverse relationship has been observed between serum AMH and FSH in both PCOS and control women; however, this association between AMH and other ovarian hormones vs FSH was lost following multivariate regression analysis. We hypothesise that these studies do not exclude an inverse relationship between AMH and FSH but that owing to the multiple interactions between ovarian and pituitary hormones, an in-depth analysis of ovarian and pituitary hormones in PCOS women similar to this study is required to clarify this relationship.",

The role of AMH within the ovary is important in regulating the release of follicles from the preantral pool.",

The presence of a LPDF resulted in altered relationships between LH and the other ovarian hormones and AFC, and further studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm these findings. The impact of the presence of LPDF on ovarian:pituitary feedback mechanisms is unclear. However, it has been shown that LPDF cycles are associated with elevated and prolonged oestradiol patterns 7, particularly with women of advanced reproductive age, which may be a consequence of this reduction in ovarian control of pituitary FSH and LH secretion.",
