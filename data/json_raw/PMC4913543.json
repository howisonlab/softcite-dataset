            "text": "Background: Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) is an important surface marker of cancer stem cells in a variety of tumors. A number of previous studies have been conducted to investigate the association between CD44 gene rs13347 C\ue02eT polymorphism and cancer risk in humans; nevertheless, the results remain controversial. We therefore performed this meta-analysis to confirm the role of this polymorphism in susceptibility to human cancer. Materials and methods: The studies published up to December 2015 were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Twelve eligible case-control studies were identified, involving a total of 6,982 cases and 7,430 controls. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a fixed or random-effect model to estimate the strength of the association. Results: The results of the overall analyses indicated that CD44 gene rs13347 polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk in Asians (CT vs CC: OR =1.35, 95% CI =1.12-1.62; TT vs CC: OR =1.99, 95% CI =1.52-2.60; TT + CT vs CC: OR =1.41, 95% CI =1.16-1.71; and TT vs CC + CT: OR =1.74, 95% CI =1.41-2.14), especially in Chinese population (CT vs CC: OR =1.42, 95% CI =1.16-1.75; TT vs CC: OR =2.13, 95% CI =1.58-2.86; TT + CT vs CC: OR =1.50, 95% CI =1.21-1.87; and TT vs CC + CT: OR =1.80, 95% CI =1.43-2.26). In stratified analyses by cancer types, there was evidence for an association between this polymorphism and nasopharyngeal cancer and breast cancer, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the CD44 gene rs13347 C\ue02eT polymorphism is associated with elevated risk of human cancer in Asians, especially in Chinese population. Further well-designed studies on a larger population covering other ethnicities should be carried out to validate our results.",

[5][6][7][8][9][10] Among these cell surface markers, CD44 is one of the most frequently reported markers, which was utilized to isolate CSCs from other cancer cells. [11][12][13] CD44, a transmembrane glycoprotein, is ubiquitously expressed in many cell types. 14 As a cell surface receptor for hyaluronate and osteopontin, CD44 is involved in many biological and physiological processes including cell migration, hematopoiesis, lymphocyte homing, embryonal development, and apoptosis. 14,15 Besides its regulation of cellular processes, CD44 plays a critical role in tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, invasion, and migration, which contributes to the progression and metastasis of tumors. [16][17][18][19] Therefore, overexpression of CD44 leads to the development of tumors and poor prognosis of several human malignancies. [20][21][22] In addition, it has been reported that CD44 + cancer cells represent enhanced resistance to chemotherapy in the nude mice-engrafted tumor model. 23,24 Recent studies have revealed that the genetic variants of CD44 gene could influence tumor cell growth and migration, 25,26 which were associated with the risk prediction and prognosis of various human cancers. [27][28][29] The gene encoding CD44 is located on chromosome 11p13. 30 A growing number of studies have been carried out to investigate the effects of several CD44 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on cancer risk. Among them, the rs13347 C\ue02eT polymorphism, located on the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of CD44 gene, is the most frequently studied. 20,31,32 This SNP might influence the CD44 gene expression, since it has been reported that subjects carrying TT and CT genotypes had remarkably higher levels of CD44 protein than those carrying CC genotype in breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. 28,31,33 To date, a number of case-control studies have been conducted to evaluate the role of CD44 gene rs13347 polymorphism in predisposition to several human cancers. 28,29,[32][33][34][35] Nevertheless, the results from different articles remain controversial. To clarify the association between CD44 gene rs13347 polymorphism and risk of cancer, we performed this metaanalysis by integrating data from eligible published studies.",

The pooled ORs were calculated by comparisons with a codominant model (CT vs CC and TT vs CC), a dominant model (TT + CT vs CC), and a recessive model (TT vs CC + CT). The values of the pooled ORs were tested by the Z-test. 37 Stratified analyses were further performed based on country (People's Republic of China or India), specific cancer types (nasopharyngeal cancer, gallbladder cancer, or breast cancer), source of controls (hospital based or population based), and genotyping method (TaqMan or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight). Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated by the chi-square-based Q-test. 38 Pooled ORs were calculated using a fixed (Mantel-Haenszel method 39 ) or a random (DerSimonian-Laird method 40 ) effective model, according to the absence (P\ue02e0.10 and I 2 \ue02c50%) or presence (P\ue02c0.10 or I 2 \ue02e50%) of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting one study each time to evaluate the stability of the results. The potential publication bias of the included studies was assessed by Begg's funnel plots graphically and Egger's test quantitatively. 41 All the statistical calculations were carried out with Stata/ SE software Version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA), using two-sided P-values, and P\ue02c0.05 was considered to be significant.",

The source of heterogeneity was investigated by covariates, such as country, cancer type, source of control, and genotype method. According to subgroup analyses, country and cancer type might be the source of heterogeneity. To explore the main origin of heterogeneity, a meta-regression analysis was performed in the comparison TT vs CC, which indicated that cancer type contributed to the most proportion in heterogeneity. Moreover, two studies on nasopharyngeal cancer 33,42 were under suspicion. After omitting these two studies, the pooled OR was not altered (TT vs CC: OR =1.74, 95% CI =1.39-2.16), whereas the heterogeneity remarkably decreased (TT vs CC: P=0.110 and I 2 =34.7% for heterogeneity).",

According to CSC theory, CSCs can drive cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. 3 As an important CSC surface maker in variant tumors, CD44 is reportedly a risk factor and poor prognostic molecular marker in various cancers. [47][48][49][50] CD44 plays a crucial role in the invasion and migration of cancer cells. In addition, overexpression of CD44 in primary tumors has been revealed to be associated with early metastasis in several human cancers. 20,29,51 CD44 gene rs13347 C\ue02eT polymorphism is a common genetic variation in the 3\u2032-UTR. It has been proved that the expression of CD44 was modulated by mRNAs, and rs13347 C\ue02eT polymorphism could alter has-mir-509-3p-mediated CD44 gene expression activity. Recently, a number of studies have been carried out to evaluate the association between this SNP and risk of cancer; however, the results were conflicting. The possible reason may be that the effects of CD44 on the development of different cancer types are not the same.",

We found an association between CD44 gene rs13347 polymorphism and human cancer risk by pooling all the data from eligible studies. The results were robust because the pooled ORs did not alter statistically in sensitivity analyses. Stratified analyses suggested that this association was mainly in a Chinese population. According to specific cancer types, this polymorphism was linked to elevated risk of gallbladder cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and breast cancer, the significance of which was limited because there were only two studies for each cancer type. Since there was significant heterogeneity by the Q-test in all the genetic models, a meta-regression analysis was performed to explore the origin of heterogeneity. As a result, different cancer types were considered to be the main source of interstudy variance, especially two studies on nasopharyngeal cancer. By removing these two studies, the heterogeneity significantly decreased but pooled ORs were not altered. However, this kind of heterogeneity was hard to eliminate in the present meta-analysis, because there were only one or two studies for one specific cancer type. Moreover, pooling data from different cancer types might affect the significance of this meta-analysis because different cancer types might give rise to different host responses, Table 2 Pooled analysis of association between cD44 rs13347 c\ue02eT polymorphism and cancer risk in asians  Abbreviations: PB, population based; HB, hospital based; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.  and the interactions between different environmental factors and host might also influence the susceptibility to different cancer types. Some limitations of the present meta-analysis should be pointed out. First, the pooled results were calculated based on unadjusted estimates, which limited us to perform a more precise assessment on adjusted estimates by several important factors such as sex, age, lifestyle, etc. Thus, lack of the baseline information restricted further evaluation of the potential interactions, because malignancy predisposition might be influenced by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Second, most of the included studies just focused on the relationship between CD44 gene rs13347 polymorphism and cancer risk, which made it hard to assess the effects of CD44 gene haplotypes composed of different CD44 gene SNPs on carcinogenesis. There was evidence that CD44 gene rs187115 A\ue02eG and rs115214213 T\ue02eC polymorphisms were associated with cancer risk. 35,42,44 Thus, the status of other CD44 gene polymorphisms might cover up the effects of rs13347 T\ue02eC polymorphism, which could lead to controversial results among different studies.",
