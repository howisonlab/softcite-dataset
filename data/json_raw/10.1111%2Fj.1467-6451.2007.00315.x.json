            "text": "The original paper asserted that retail establishments in large markets have greater average sales and employment. The paper supported this assertion by showing that regressions of retailers' average sizes on market sizes yielded positive and significant coefficients for most of the retail industries under consideration, even after controlling for differences between markets' factor prices and demographics. The paper reported estimates based on three estimation techniques, ordinary least squares, instrumental variables, and nonparametric density-weighted average derivative estimation. While recently extending that paper's results, we discovered a coding error in the Gauss procedure we wrote to calculate estimates of density-weighted average derivatives. 1 We have corrected this error, and we have found that the correctly calculated estimates quantitatively support the article's original conclusion. The purpose of this erratum is to present corrected tables for the paper. Following our discovery of the programming error, we examined all of the paper's results for possible errors. In the process, we found some relatively inconsequential errors in the original tables due to incorrect transcription of original program output. The corrected tables are reported as Tables I through VI below. These table numbers correspond to those in the original article."

            "text": "1 The specific error involved the implementation of the following operation. Given two identically sized column vectors x and y, sum the elements of x for which the corresponding elements of y weakly exceed zero. In Matlab, this can be done with sum(x( y 4 5 0)). If all elements of y are strictly negative, then x( y 4 5 0) returns an empty matrix, and the sum of the empty matrix's elements is zero. To conduct this operation in Gauss, we calculated the indices of y's non-negative elements with i 5 indexcat( y 4 5 0,1). We then calculated the sum of the corresponding elements of x with sumc (x[i]). If all of the elements of y are non-positive, then indexcat sets the variable i equal to a missing value code. In Gauss, indexing a vector with a missing value code returns the entire vector. Hence, if all of the elements of y are non-positive, the Gauss code we used returned the sum of all the elements of x. Our program would have worked correctly if Gauss interpreted a matrix indexed with a missing value as Matlab does. However, we failed to account for this aspect of the Gauss language. The direct consequence of this error was the incorrect calculation of non-parametric density estimates.
