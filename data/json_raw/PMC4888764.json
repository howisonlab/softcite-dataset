            "text": "Cardiac bioenergetics are known to be abnormal in experimental uremia as exemplified by a reduced phosphocreatine (PCr)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio. However, the progression of these bioenergetic changes during the development of uremia still requires further study and was therefore investigated at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after partial nephrectomy (PNx). Methods: A two-stage PNx uremia model in male Wistar rats was used to explore in vivo cardiac and skeletal muscles' bioenergetic changes over time. High-energy phosphate nucleotides were determined by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P-NMR) and capillary zone electrophoresis. Results: 31 P-NMR spectroscopy revealed lower PCr/ATP ratios in PNx hearts compared to sham (SH)-operated animals 4 weeks after PNx (median values given \u00b1 SD, 0.64\u00b10.16 PNx, 1.13\u00b10.31 SH, P,0.02). However, 8 weeks after PNx, the same ratio was more comparable between the two groups (0.84\u00b10.15 PNx, 1.04\u00b10.44 SH, P= not significant), suggestive of an adaptive mechanism. When 8-week hearts were prestressed with dobutamine, the PCr/ATP ratio was again lower in the PNx group (1.08\u00b10.36 PNx, 1.55\u00b10.38 SH, P,0.02), indicating a reduced energy reserve during the progression of uremic heart disease. 31 P-NMR data were confirmed by capillary zone electrophoresis, and the changes in myocardial bioenergetics were replicated in the skeletal muscle. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of the changes that occur in myocardial energetics in experimental uremia and highlights how skeletal muscle bioenergetics mirror those found in the cardiac tissue and so might potentially serve as a practical surrogate tissue during clinical cardiac NMR investigations.",

            "text": "Ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and anemia are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but there is evidence that a number of other important factors contribute to the clinical syndrome that has been termed uremic cardiomyopathy. The changes seen in the uremic heart have not been shown to be specific to uremia, and it is likely that uremic cardiomyopathy is multifactorial and derived from a combination of features present in the uremic patient. The critical importance of bioenergetics during the development of uremic cardiomyopathies and of the signaling pathways involved has been highlighted, including the role of mTOR 1 and insulin resistance via Akt. 2 However, while changing cardiac bioenergetics have been studied in many different pathologies, such as left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), obesity, diabetes, heart failure, and myocardial ischemia, [3][4][5][6][7] the progressive bioenergetic changes found in the uremic heart have been largely overlooked.",

            "text": "It is an established practice when assessing myocardial bioenergetics to calculate the phosphocreatine (PCr)/ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio. This is because ATP production within the myocardium is produced largely from intramitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This in turn is then transported to the sites of energy utilization, particularly the myofibrils. This is enabled by the generation of PCr that diffuses to the myofibrils where ATP is regenerated. Increases in energy demand tend, therefore, to result in a decreased PCr/ATP ratio rather than a fall in ATP. Thus, the PCr/ATP ratio represents a measure of instantaneous cardiac energetic state. 3 Clinical studies of LVH using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance ( 31 P-NMR) have tended to suffer from small patient numbers and have shown conflicting results. 8,9 Both Conway et al 10 and Neubauer et al 11 while studying patients with aortic stenosis and investigating patients with aortic incompetence, respectively, found that any reduction in the PCr/ATP ratio was related to the degree of heart failure. However, a study of patients with mitral regurgitation found significant reductions in the PCr/ATP ratio that correlated with both the degree of heart failure and LVH. 12 Lamb et al 13 found a reduced PCr/ATP ratio in eleven hypertensive patients with a strong association between ratios and the degree of diastolic dysfunction. More recent work using a higher magnetic field (3 T instead of 1.5 T) 7 and a larger patient population revealed that the PCr/ATP ratio is greatly reduced in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=26) compared to control subjects (n=37, P,0.0001). In contrast to these results, studies of elite athletes with \"physiological\" LVH have shown no reduction in the PCr/ATP ratio compared to that of control subjects. 14 There are only a few cardiac bioenergetics studies available about patients with CKD. Tagami et al 15 studied 14 CKD patients treated with maintenance dialysis (hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) and found a decreased cardiac PCr/ATP ratio, particularly in patients with a history of heart failure. Perseghin et al 16 compared the left ventricle PCr/ATP ratio in many different patient groups and found a significant reduction when comparing uremic patients (n=10) with control subjects (n=13). More recent work by Patel et al 17 demonstrated that patients with CKD had lower PCr/ATP ratios than hypertensive patients with and without LVH. This observation confirms the much earlier findings of Raine et al 18 who found that the uremic rat (partial nephrectomy [PNx]) had significantly lower PCr/ATP ratios in the uremic group compared to sham (SH)-operated control animals. This reduction in the PCr/ATP ratio was accompanied by reduced contractile indices in the functional assessment of the uremic hearts. However, much of this work was generated using an ex vivo Langendorff heart preparation that limits its clinical significance.",

The hearts were studied in vivo using NMR spectroscopy to investigate the time course of changes in the PCr/ATP ratio after PNx. The relationship of the bioenergetic parameters to the degree of uremia, hemoglobin status, and blood pressure were all studied. Cardiac and skeletal muscles were assessed with the aim of identifying if parallel changes occurred in both tissues. In addition, confirmation of our NMR findings was sought by using a distinct methodology (capillary zone electrophoresis [CZE]) to determine PCr and ATP concentrations.",

Stressed hearts 8 weeks following PNx were obtained from animals given intravenous dobutamine as an infusion (15 \u00b5g\u22c5kg \u22121 \u22c5min \u22121 ) for 20 minutes prior to freeze clamping. A blood gas sample was taken to ensure that pH and pO 2 remained within the desired range. Blood was reserved for hemoglobin and creatinine measurement from both stressed and unstressed hearts.",

The voltage applied was 17.5 kV, and ultraviolet (UV) detection was performed at 254 nm for adenine nucleotides or 200 nm for PCr. The capillary was thermostatically maintained at 25\u00b0C. The separation buffer used in all experiments was sodium tetraborate (20 mM) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (1 mM), adjusted to pH 9.2. The spatial area of each peak was calculated by integrating the area of the migration time. For each standard, the area under the curve was plotted against the concentration injected and calibration curves were constructed. From the spatial area of each peak on the electropherogram of each heart sample extract, the concentration of each substance was determined from the calibration curves.",

However, identical experiments conducted 8 weeks following PNx showed no reduction in the PCr/ATP ratio. A possible reason for this finding is that the development of adaptive and compensatory myocardial changes formed over time is masking bioenergetic abnormalities at rest. This hypothesis is supported by the evidence that the stressor agent dobutamine was able to reveal changes in the PCr/ATP at 8 weeks that were not seen when the hearts were unstressed (comparing Figure 2A and B). Tellingly, similar bioenergetic changes were observed when studying skeletal muscle, and this raises    the possibility of using skeletal muscle bioenergetics as a surrogate tissue for the heart, as determination of skeletal muscle bioenergetics is a much easier and less invasive procedure to perform than cardiac measurement.",

            "text": "There are many possible causes for a diminished PCr/ ATP ratio in the heart. In normal circumstances, large changes in energy expenditure produce only modest changes in the PCr/ATP ratio as a result of the tight regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. 26 Oxygen limitation due to cell metabolism may occur because of the well-recognized capillary rarefaction. Anemia may exacerbate this effect, in addition to any increase in catecholamine levels or myocyte sensitivity to catecholamines 5,27,28 with or without changes in intracellular changes in calcium concentration and sensitivity. Catecholamine stress has also been shown to reduce the PCr/ATP ratio in obese subjects but not in subjects of normal weight. 5 Another possible cause of abnormal myocardial bioenergetics in uremia may be due to altered substrate utilization. Previous studies in animals have shown that in LVH, an increase in the utilization of glucose in preference to free fatty acids occurs. 29 Christe and Rodgers studied the isolated perfused heart of the spontaneously hypertensive rat with LVH and hypertension. 30 They found enhanced glucose oxidation and suppressed fatty acid oxidation in the spontaneously hypertensive rat compared to normotensive controls. Similar findings of depressed fatty acid oxidation 31,32 and enhanced glycolytic capacity 33 have been observed in other forms of LVH. It is possible that in the uremic environment, the substrate specificity is different from normal hearts early on during the course of uremia, and this may explain the decreased PCr/ATP ratio seen at 4 weeks post-PNx. The change in substrate utilization may take some time to become fully effective, and this is a possible explanation for the \"normalization\" of PCr/ATP ratios seen in the uremic hearts at 8 weeks: the adaptive mechanism has become functional.",

These findings therefore closely mirror the cardiac data. Previous studies of skeletal muscle bioenergetics in uremia have produced conflicting results. One study of calf muscle in dialysis patients using NMR found no differences in PCr, ATP, or inorganic phosphate levels at rest, but when the muscle was exercised, a reduction in PCr and ATP concentrations was seen in uremic patients. 35 Recovery of PCr concentrations was slower in the dialysis group, suggesting a defect in oxidative metabolism in the uremic muscle. 35 Another study provides support for this conclusion, with a decreased calculated phosphorylation potential in the skeletal muscle of dialysis patients compared to healthy control subjects. 36 The results described here suggest that skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle may behave in a similar manner in CKD. Skeletal muscle is simpler to study in vivo than cardiac muscle, and results obtained in skeletal muscle may therefore prove to extend to cardiac muscle. Moreover, intracellular pH in skeletal muscle can be measured much more easily than in cardiac muscle. Skeletal muscle intracellular pH in uremic and control groups was found to be similar, consistent with other published findings, 35 which permits us to rule out acid/base changes being the cause of the abnormal bioenergetics.",

More definitive evidence would have been provided in terms of bioenergetics reserve if we had conducted dobutamine stress in the heart tissue at 4 weeks and further confirmation of the surrogate nature of skeletal muscle had we performed a stress test in that tissue at 8 weeks. However, this was only appreciated after the study was complete. Nevertheless, we believe that the evidence shown here in this in vivo study provides important data of bioenergetics in a realistic setting of uremia, with no restriction of substrate or neurohumoral mechanisms such as those found in ex vivo studies. In addition, our in vivo NMR data are supported by our chromatographic study using CZE. This suggests that the changes in bioenergetics measured by NMR in this study do reflect genuine changes in high-energy phosphates in vivo and furthermore give credence to the possibility of using skeletal muscle as a useful surrogate marker for cardiac tissue in clinical subjects where required.",
