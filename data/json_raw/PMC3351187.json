In Helix 74 of Escherichia coli 23S rRNA, guanosines at positions 2069 and 2445 are modified to 7-methylguanosine(m 7 G) and N 2-methylguanosine(m 2 G), respectively. We searched for the gene responsible for m 7 G2069 formation, and identified rlmL, which encodes the methyltransferase for m 2 G2445, as responsible for the biogenesis of m 7 G2069. In vitro methylation of rRNA revealed that rlmL encodes a fused methyltransferase responsible for forming both m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445. We renamed the gene rlmKL. The N-terminal RlmL activity for m 2 G2445 formation was significantly enhanced by the C-terminal RlmK. Moreover, RlmKL had an unwinding activity of Helix 74, facilitating cooperative methylations of m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 during biogenesis of 50S subunit. In fact, we observed that RlmKL was involved in the efficient assembly of 50S subunit in a mutant strain lacking an RNA helicase deaD.",

            "text": "The ribosome is a ribonucleoprotein complex that translates genetic information on mRNA into the corresponding amino acid sequence to generate a protein. The ribosome consists of small and large subunits, each of which is composed of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and ribosomal proteins. The rRNAs form the basic structure of the ribosome, and play central roles in the fundamental processes of protein biosynthesis (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6). In all domains of life, rRNAs contain residues with various chemical modifications that are enzymatically introduced after transcription. These modifications are primarily base methylation, ribose methylation and pseudouridylation (7,8). In prokaryotes, rRNA modifications are introduced by site-specific RNA-modifying enzymes, whereas in eukaryotes, most rRNA modifications, namely 2 0 -O-methylations and pseudouridylations, are introduced by a series of small nucleolar RNA-protein complexes (snoRNPs) composed of a protein methyltransferase or pseudouridylase and a specific snoRNA as a guide RNA to determine the precise position for modification (9). rRNA modifications are clustered near the active sites of the ribosome such as the decoding center, subunit interfaces, transfer RNA (tRNA) or mRNA binding sites and the peptidyl-transferase center (10,11), implying that these modifications are required for proper function of the rRNAs. However, many rRNA modifications are dispensable for cell viability (12). In fact, the lack of a single rRNA modification confers only a mild defect in cell growth and ribosomal function. Hence, the exact function of each modification is unknown. However, collective disruption of several modifications causes a severe defect in ribosomal function and cell growth (13,14). Therefore, each rRNA modification plays a specific role in fine-tuning ribosomal activity and/or biogenesis (8).",

The modifications are 10 pseudouridines, 24 methylated nucleosides, 1 dihydrouridine and 1 5-hydroxycytidine (15). Although all of the pseudouridine synthase genes have been identified in E. coli, several methyltransferases still remain to be identified. In the decoding center of the small subunit of the ribosome, rRNA modifications play roles in maintaining the translational fidelity by suppressing frameshifts and read-through activity (16)(17)(18), and ensuring accurate translational initiation (19,20). In the large 50S subunit of the ribosome, rRNA-modifying enzymes such as RrmJ/ FtsJ and RluD are required for efficient assembly of the subunit (21)(22)(23)(24), indicating that the enzymes themselves act as assembly factors for efficient biogenesis of the ribosome (25). In addition, some rRNA modifications are involved in modulating susceptibility to certain antibiotics (26,27).",

            "text": "In Helix 74, in domain V of the 23S rRNA, G2069 and G2445 are modified to form 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G) and N 2 -methylguanosine (m 2 G), respectively ( Figure 1A and B). The methyltransferase RlmL, encoded by rlmL/ycbY, catalyzes S-adenosylmethionine (Ado-Met)dependent m 2 G2445 formation (34). Although deletion of rlmL/ycbY resulted in a slight growth reduction phenotype, the functional and physiological role of m 2 G2445 remains unclear (34). The methyltransferase mediating the biogenesis of m 7 G2069 has not yet been identified. In this study, we employed a genome-wide screen of uncharacterized genes in E. coli using the ribonucleome analysis to search for the gene responsible for m 7 G2069 formation. We happened to identify rlmL/ycbY as responsible for the biogenesis of m 7 G2069. In fact, rlmL/ycbY encodes a fused methyltransferase with dual active sites responsible for forming both m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 ( Figure 1C). Thus, rlmL/ycbY has been renamed rlmKL. Genetic and biochemical characterization of this unique enzyme has revealed that cooperative methylation of Helix 74 by RlmKL plays a key role in the efficient assembly of the 50S subunit.",

To examine the time course of methylation ( Figure 4C and D and Supplementary Figures S2 and S4), a 100-ml reaction mixture was prepared and 10-ml aliquots were taken at each time point and mixed with phenol-chloroform to stop the reaction.

The methylated and unmethylated fragments were quantified by summing the areas of the mass chromatograms (\u00b10.1 tolerance) of all detected ions. The frequency of methylation was calculated from the ratio of the areas of the mass chromatograms for the methylated and unmethylated fragments. For accurate quantification of both methylations, we generated a standard curve for the area ratio of the chromatograms against the ratio of the methylated fragments (Supplementary Figure S5). Using these curves, we could determine the exact values for methylation.",

            "text": "To identify gene products responsible for rRNA modifications in E. coli, we employed a reverse genetic approach combined with RNA MS (ribonucleome analysis) for genome-wide screening in E. coli (20,28). Total RNA, consisting primarily of rRNAs and mRNAs, was prepared from 94 genomic-deletion strains of E. coli (38), each of which lacks about 20 kb ($20 genes) (see Supplementary Data). Thus, this analysis covered almost 2000 genes, $40% of the total 4762 genes of E. coli. Total RNA was digested into fragments by base-specific ribonucleases (RNase T1 or RNase A) and the digests were analyzed by capillary LC coupled with nano ESI LC/MS. In these complex mixtures of RNA fragments, we can detect RNA fragments containing modified nucleoside(s) as multiply-charged negative ions by monitoring the specific mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) value. Using both RNase T1 and RNase A, we can detect all modifications to be analyzed. In wild-type E. coli, we clearly detected the triple-charged negative ion (m/z 1706) of a 16-mer fragment including m 7 G2069 (Um 7 GAACCUUUACUA UAGp; MW 5120) produced by RNase T1 digestion, and the double-charged negative ion (m/z 1024) of a hexamer fragment including m 2 G2445 (Gm 2 GGGADp; MW 2049) produced by RNase A digestion ( Figures 1B and 2A). Each fragment was analyzed by collision-induced dissociation (CID) by MS/MS to confirm the exact position of the modification ( Figure 2B). When we analyzed RNA fragments from the deletion strain OCR55 (DpncB-rmf), the 16-mer fragment bearing m 7 G2069 was absent ( Figure 2A). If 7-methylation of G does not occur at position 2069, an unmodified 14-mer fragment (AACCU UUACUAUAGp; m/z 1485, MW 4454) should be detected. In fact, we clearly detected this 14-mer fragment from the OCR55 strain (data not shown), confirming the absence of m 7 G2069. These data indicated that a gene responsible for m 7 G2069 formation resides in this deleted region. Since rlmL/ycbY is also localized in this region, no hexamer fragment bearing m 2 G2445 was observed ( Figure 2A). To identify the gene responsible for m 7 G2069 formation, we analyzed 23 single gene knockout strains (KO collections), each of which lacks one gene in the deleted region of OCR55. The DrlmL/ycbY strain was found to lack the 16-mer fragment bearing m 7 G2069 (Figure 2A). To our surprise, rlmL/ycbY gene encodes a known methyltransferase, RlmL, which is responsible for m 2 G2445 formation (34) and in fact, no hexamer fragment bearing m 2 G2445 was detected in this strain (Figure 2A). When a plasmid encoding rlmL/ycbY was introduced into the DrlmL/ ycbY strain, both m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 were detected in the total RNA ( Figure 2A). These data clearly demonstrated that rlmL/ycbY is responsible not only for m 2 G2445 formation, but also for m 7 G2069 formation.  Therefore, we renamed the gene rlmKL according to the preferred nomenclature (39,40).",

According to the cluster of orthologous group (COG) database (42), the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of RlmKL have been annotated as COG0116 and COG1092, respectively. Each domain has an Ado-Met-dependent methyltransferase motif ( Figure 3A). The rlmKL gene is conserved in g-proteobacteria (Supplementary Figure S1). However, in b-proteobacteria, Neisseria meningitidis bears COG0116 and COG1092 as separate proteins encoded at different genomic loci (Supplementary Figure S1). Since rlmKL appears to be responsible for two different methyl modifications, we hypothesized that each methyltransferase domain catalyzes the formation of one modification, either m 7 G2069 or m 2 G2445. To examine this possibility, we carried out complementation tests for the two methyl modifications in the DrlmKL strain by introducing various rlmKL mutants. We constructed rlmKL mutants in which conserved amino acid residues were substituted with Ala, including D195A, N309A, N397A, R530A, D568A and D597A. As a positive control, introduction of plasmid-encoded rlmKL into the DrlmKL strain restored both methyl modifications ( Figure 3B). Subsequently, each of the rlmKL mutants was introduced into the DrlmKL strain, and formation of the methyl modifications was examined. The N309A mutation in the NTD impaired m 2 G2445 formation, but rescued m 7 G2069 formation ( Figure 3B). In contrast, the D568A mutation in the CTD did not rescue m 7 G2069 formation, but m 2 G2445 was efficiently formed in this mutant ( Figure 3B). These observations suggested that the NTD and CTD of RlmKL encode an RlmL for m 2 G2445 formation and an RlmK for m 7 G2069 formation, respectively. Asn397 is located in the linker region between the NTD and CTD. Since the N397A mutant exhibited no m 2 G2445 formation but rescued m 7 G2069 formation, Asn397 should be considered part of RlmL. The other mutations, including D195A, R530A and D597A, did not affect methylation (data not shown).",

The E. coli RlmKL and the RlmK(CTD) and RlmL(NTD) constructs were expressed recombinantly and purified to homogeneity ( Figure 4A). As substrates, we isolated 50S ribosomal subunits and naked 23S rRNA lacking both m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 from the DrlmKL strain. The recombinant proteins were incubated with the 50S subunit and the naked 23S rRNA in the presence or absence of Ado-Met as a methyl donor and the rRNAs were then extracted and analyzed by LC/MS. No methylation was formed when the 50S subunit was used as the substrate for RlmKL ( Figure 4B). When the naked 23S rRNA was used as a substrate, both m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 were successfully reconstituted by RlmKL in the presence of Ado-Met ( Figure 4B). These results clearly showed that RlmKL uses the naked 23S rRNA as a substrate, indicating that methyl modifications of Helix 74 by RlmKL are likely to be introduced at an early step in 50S assembly in the cell. Next, m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 formation by RlmK(CTD) and RlmL(NTD), respectively, was reconstituted. As expected, m 7 G2069 was generated by RlmK(CTD), whereas m 2 G2445 was generated by RlmL(NTD) ( Figure 4B). These data demonstrated that RlmKL is a fused methyltransferase, with each of the domains, N-terminal RlmL and C-terminal RlmK, acting independently as a methyltransferase. To facilitate the in vitro experiments, we examined the 23S rRNA domain V, which was transcribed in vitro. In fact, both methylations were efficiently introduced to the domain V transcript.",

We employed the domain V transcript as a substrate to compare the activities of m 2 G2445 formation catalyzed by RlmL(NTD) and RlmKL ( Figure 4C). The initial velocity of m 2 G2445 formation by RlmKL was much higher than that by RlmL(NTD). Whether the RlmL(NTD)-catalyzed m 2 G2445 formation was affected by the addition of RlmK(CTD) in trans was also examined ( Figure 4C). The initial velocity of m 2 G2445 formation was increased depending on the concentration of RlmK(CTD), showing that the addition of RlmK(CTD) elevated the m 2 G2445forming activity of RlmL(NTD). In the presence of 0.8 mM RlmK(CTD), 0.1 mM RlmL(NTD) exhibited an m 2 G2445-forming activity level similar to 0.1 mM RlmKL ( Figure 4C). It was speculated that m 2 G2445 formation by RlmL(NTD) might be enhanced by the presence of m 7 G2069 generated by RlmK(CTD) in substrate RNA. To examine this possibility, we prepared the domain V transcript with m 7 G2069 (82% was modified). However, the presence of m 7 G2069 did not affect the m 2 G2445-forming activity (Supplementary Figure S2). In contrast, the initial velocities of m 7 G2069 formation by RlmKL and RlmK were very similar ( Figure 4D). In these experiments, we clearly demonstrated that the fusion of these two methyltransferases enhances the efficiency of m 2 G2445 formation.",

By the end point measurement, over 90% of the domain V transcript (transcript 1) was methylated at both positions ( Figure 4E and F). The methylation of transcript 2 indicated that the lower parts of domain V, including Helices 73, 89 and 90-93, are not necessary for either methylation ( Figure 4E and F). Even when the upper part of domain V was truncated, as in transcripts 3, 4 and 5 (Supplementary Figure S3) m 7 G2069 and m 2 G2445 were efficiently formed ( Figure 4E and F). These results indicated that removal of the upper part (Helices 76-79), as well as the right part (Helices 81-88) with connecting residues C2258 and C2422 (transcript 4) or connecting residues C2258 and A2426 (transcripts 3 and 5) resulted in little effect on either methylation ( Figure 4E and F). In contrast, transcript 7 ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure S3), which lacks Helix 80 and the 12 nt single-strand (ss) region ( Figure 1B), was not methylated at either position ( Figure 4F). This result indicated that Helix 80 and the 12 nt ss region are critical sites necessary for m 2 G2445 and m 7 G2069 formation. Additionally, in the 29-mer single-stranded transcript 6 which consists of residues C2422 to A2450 ( Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure S3), m 2 G2445 was efficiently formed ( Figure 4F). This result indicated that duplex formation of H74 is not required for the m 2 G2445 formation.",

RlmL(NTD) catalyzed the m 2 G2445 formation on transcript 6, but did not efficiently methylate transcript 4 which forms Helix 74 ( Figure 4E). This result strongly suggests that RlmL prefers the single-stranded RNA substrate for the m 2 G2445 formation. Taken together with the observation that RlmK domain has a function to support the m 2 G2445 formation by RlmL(NTD), we speculated that RlmK domain unwinds the duplex structure of Helix 74, thereby facilitating the efficient N 2 -methylation of G2445 catalyzed by the RlmL domain.",

The duplex and single strands were resolved by native PAGE to monitor the unwinding of the duplex with the passage of reaction time ( Figure 5B). In the presence of RlmKL, 71% of the duplex substrate was unwound in the first 3 min, and 92% was unwound in 30 min ( Figure 5B). As a control, in the presence of BSA, 29% of the duplex substrate was spontaneously converted to the single strand, and 66% was unwound in 30 min ( Figure 5B). In the presence of RlmKL, the half-life (t 1/2 ) of the duplex substrate was 2.5 min, whereas in the presence of BSA, t 1/2 was 6.0 min ( Figure 5C). We also examined the unwinding activity of RlmKL in the absence of Ado-Met, and found no change in the activity (data not shown). These results suggested that RlmKL has an activity to unwind Helix 74 during substrate recognition and methylation.",

In the 12 nt ss region, C2427, G2429 and A2430 are recognized for both methylations, and especially G2428 and G2429 were critical for N 2 -methylation of G2445 and additionally, the residues 2431-2433 are recognized for m 2 G2445 formation. In Helix 74, C2064/G2446, C2065/G2445, C2066/G2444, G2067/C2443, U2068, A2070/U2441 and A2071/U2438 were essential for 7-methylation of G2069.

The relative orientations of these bases are shown in the crystal structure of the 50S subunit ( Figure 6E). These results clearly demonstrated that different sets of residues were involved, respectively, in 7-methylation of G2069 and N 2 -methylation of G2445, suggesting that the N-terminal RlmL and C-terminal RlmK domains in RlmKL recognize distinct residues in the substrate.",

            "text": "The protein product of ycbY has been reported to co-sediment with the early assembly intermediate of the 50S ribosomal subunit in E. coli (43). In addition, YcbY interacts with the DeaD and SrmB proteins, which are DEAD-box RNA helicases involved in 50S subunit formation (44)(45)(46). These results suggested that RlmKL may be involved in an early stage of the biogenesis of the 50S subunit. However, disruption of the rlmKL gene showed almost no growth phenotype even when cells were cultured at low temperature ( Figure 7A), and no significant change in ribosome profile was detected ( Figure 7B). Since YcbY interacts with DeaD and SrmB in E. coli (45), we explored the synthetic growth phenotype of the DrlmKL strain in which RNA helicases, including deaD, srmB, rhlE and dbpA, were knocked out. As shown in Figure 7A, we observed a synthetic growth phenotype with deaD, in particular at low temperature. When cultured at 37 C, the doubling time of the DrlmKL/ DdeaD strain (28.4 min) was delayed by 4.5 min relative to the DrlmKL strain (23.9 min) and 2.9 min relative to the DdeaD strain (25.

RsmC consists of two methyltransferase domains. The CTD has a bona fide methyltransferase that catalyzes m 2 G1207 formation using Ado-Met. The NTD has homology to Ado-Met-dependent methyltransferases but has no methyltransferase activity due to mutations in the conserved residues for Ado-Met binding. However, the NTD is required for the stability of the CTD and plays a supportive role in substrate recognition by the CTD (50). In RlmKL, conjugation of RlmL and RlmK is advantageous for facilitating the m 2 G2445 formation. In addition, the m 2 G2445 formation catalyzed by the RlmL(NTD) can be enhanced by the supportive substrate recognition by the RlmK(CTD), similar to the function of the non-catalytic methyltransferase domain in RsmC.",

Due to their sequence similarity, COG0116 and COG1092 can be aligned and placed in the same phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Figure S6). The non-rooted neighbor-joining (NJ) tree shown in Supplementary Figure S6 reveals that COG0116 and COG1092 are clearly separate from each other with 100% bootstrap probability. In this analysis, we found that both COGs were composed of at least two distinct classes of enzymes. COG0116 contains RlmL, as well as Trm14 which is a N 2 -methyltransferase for archaeal tRNAs (51), while COG1092 contains RlmK, as well as RlmI, which is responsible for m 5 C1962 formation in 23S rRNA (52). The strong similarity between these RNA methyltransferases makes classification of the enzymes complicated. By examining the phylogenetic clusters containing RlmL and RlmK, we can confirm that RlmKL is only present in g-proteobacteria, and that the separated RlmK and RlmL are found in the genus Neisseria, suggesting that the conjugation of these two enzymes should have occurred in the common ancestor of g-proteobacteria.

Structural analysis revealed that RlmI has three domains, a Rossman-fold domain, an EEHEE domain, and a PUA domain (53). RlmK also has two first domains, the Rossman-fold and EEHEE domains. The Rossman-fold is found in a typical methyltransferase domain containing the Ado-Met binding motif. The EEHEE domain is an RNA recognition module composed of b-sheets and an a-helix, and is found in rRNA methyltransferases including RlmI and RlmD (54). RlmD is the methyltransferase responsible for m 3 U1939 formation. According to the crystal structure of the ternary complex consisting of the partial RNA substrate, RlmD and Ado-Met (54), the EEHEE domain binds to the single-stranded RNA 5 0 of the target uridine, U1939. Therefore, the EEHEE domain is thought to be a single-stranded RNA binding module that recognizes the sequence immediately 5 0 of the target site. Together with our observation that RlmK recognizes residues C2064, C2065 C2066, G2067 and U2068, which are residues immediately 5 0 of the target G2069, it is possible that the EEHEE domain of RlmK recognizes the 5 0 strand adjacent to G2069 in Helix 74.",

            "text": "Based on this study, we propose a catalytic mechanism for the cooperative modifications of Helix 74 (Figure 8). Our biochemical data has shown that RlmK recognizes Helix 80, the conserved bases in the P-loop, 12 nt ss region and Helix74, whereas RlmL recognizes critical residues in the 12 nt ss region and the 3 0 strand of Helix 74 ( Figure 6D). As shown in the crystal structure of the 50S subunit ( Figure 6E), the residues required for m 2 G2445 formation are interrupted by the residues essential for m 7 G2069 formation. Thus, both domains of RlmKL cannot bind Helix 74 at the same time in the folded structure of the 23S rRNA. In addition, RlmL(NTD) preferentially recognizes and methylates the single-stranded substrate rather than the duplex substrate, suggesting that Helix 74 should be unwound to serve as the preferred substrate for RlmL(NTD) during dimethylformation. In fact, we could directly observe an unwinding activity of RlmKL with the duplex substrate formed by transcripts 8 and 9 ( Figure 5C), strongly supporting the proposed mechanism of cooperative methylation by RlmKL. As discussed above, RlmK has an EEHEE domain that may recognize the 5 0 residues neighboring G2069 in Helix 74. Since several residues in the 5 0 strand of Helix 74 are essential for m 7 G2069 formation, the EEHEE domain may recognize these bases and unwind Helix 74, releasing the 3 0 ss for RlmL(NTD) recognition.",

            "text": "We observed that the DrlmKL/DdeaD strain exhibited a synthetic growth phenotype, especially at low temperatures and had defects in 50S subunit assembly ( Figure 7). This result indicated that RlmKL and the DeaD RNA helicase work redundantly in ribosome assembly. As the DeaD RNA helicase possess an ATP-dependent RNA chaperone activity that modulates the local structure of rRNA, RlmKL may act as an assembly factor. RlmKL does not recognize the assembled 50S subunit but uses the naked 23S rRNA as a substrate. In addition, RlmKL co-sediments with the assembly intermediate of the 50S subunit (43), suggesting that RlmKL directly interacts with the 23S rRNA at an early step in 50S assembly. Since RlmKL unwinds Helix 74 during dimethyl formation, the local structural alterations in domain V, induced by RlmKL recognition, may be involved in the correct folding of the rRNA after transcription, domain-domain interactions, and/or hierarchical association of ribosomal proteins in the early steps of 50S assembly. Further study will be required to elucidate the precise role of RlmKL as an assembly factor in ribosome biogenesis.",
