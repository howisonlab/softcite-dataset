            "text": "The competency of garlic and pennywort to improve broiler chicken growth and influence intestinal microbial communities and fatty acid composition of breast meat were studied. Two hundred forty, \"day-old\" chicks were randomly allocated to 4 treatment groups consisting of 6 replications of 10 chicks in each pen. The groups were assigned to receive treatment diets as follows: i) basal diet (control), ii) basal diet plus 0.5% garlic powder (GP), iii) basal diet plus 0.5% pennywort powder (PW) and iv) 0.002% virginiamycin (VM). Birds were killed at day 42 and intestinal samples were collected to assess for Lactobacillus and Escherichia coli. The pectoralis profundus from chicken breast samples was obtained from 10 birds from each treatment group on day 42 and frozen at \uf02d20\uf0b0C for further analyses. Fatty acid profile of breast muscles was determined using gas liquid chromatography. Feed intake and weight gain of broilers fed with GP, PW, and VM were significantly higher (p<0.05) compared to control. Feeding chicks GP, PW, and VM significantly reduced Escherichia coli count (p<0.05) while Lactobacillus spp count were significantly higher (p<0.05) in the gut when compared to control group on day 42. Supplemented diet containing pennywort increased the C18:3n-3 fatty acid composition of chickens' breast muscle. Garlic and pennywort may be useful in modulating broiler guts as they control the enteropathogens that help to utilize feed efficiently. This subsequently enhances the growth performances of broiler chickens."

The benefits of herbal feed additives in improving growth performance and nutrient digestibility, and reducing pathogens have been reported (Zulkifli et al., 2012). Garlic bulb, paste, oil, powder, husk and leaves may influence the performance of farm animals (Qureshi et al., 1983). The functions of garlic are mainly attributed to the bioactive components, including sulfur-containing compounds such as alliin, diallylsulphides and allicin (Amagase et al., 2001). Allicin and its derivatives have been shown to be a larvicidal and bacteriostatic, active against both Gram positive or Gram negative organisms as well as fungi such as Candida albicans and viruses including influenza viruses (Chang and Cheong, 2008). Kumar and Berwal (1998) tested antibacterial activity of fresh garlic bulbs against the potent food pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi and sensitive among all pathogen tested to the effect of garlic.",

The chemical composition of pennywort has a very important role in medicinal and nutriceutical applications. These applications are most likely due to its biologically active constituents of triterpenes namely asiatic acid and asiaticoside (Inamdar et al., 1996). Noraharaini et al.

On the contrary, Proudfoot et al. (1990) showed that supplementing broiler chickens with virginiamycin had negligible effect on growth performance. Earlier report (Slyranda et al., 2011) suggested that the effect of garlic supplementation on growth performance in broilers is inconsistent. Demir et al. (2003) and Pourali et al. (2010) reported that garlic supplementation at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 1.0% had negligible influence on growth performance. On the contrary, Kumar et al. (2010) reported that supplementing broilers with garlic based growth promoter at 250 ppm improved BW and FCR. The present findings clearly suggested that birds fed diets supplemented garlic had higher feed intake and greater BW than controls. Improvement in BW could be due to flavouring compound in garlic which attributed the chickens to consume more, hence leading to higher body weight. According to Qureshi et al. (1983), inclusion of garlic more than 0.6% reduced feed intake and weight gain. It appears that the effectiveness of dietary garlic supplementation in improving growth is dose dependent.",

However, feeding broilers pelleted rations may further improve their FCR (Zulkifli and Ramlah, 1998). the present findings, it appears that GP, PW and VM are equally effective in improving feed intake and weight gain of broilers. The FCR for GP, PW and VM were not significantly different (p>0.05). This may suggested that the response of chickens to growth promoters could be related to genetic background (Miles et al., 1984;Butaye et al., 2003) The microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract of poultry plays an important role in normal digestive processes and health maintenance (Woods et al., 1999). The present findings suggested that GP, PW and VM are able to reduce intestinal Escherichia coli counts in broilers. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2010) indicated that the inclusion of garlic at 250 ppm in the broiler diet reduced the count of Escherichia coli as well as reduction of Salmonella when compared to control group. In vitro studies suggested that the antibacterial property of garlic is attributed to allicin compound (Ankri and Mirelman, 1999;Willis and Reid, 2003). The present study also demonstrated that dietary supplementation of pennywort may also reduce Escherichia coli count in the gut. According to Norzaharaini et al.

The increase in HDL will result in higher antiatherogenic index and HDLcholesterol/total cholesterol ratio. Hence, pennywort has the potential to control the formation of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in rats (Hussin et al., 2009). Nevertheless, pennywort contained high levels of omega-3 fatty acid of fatty acid composition 3.98% compared to garlic which might increase the omega-3 fatty acid composition in meat by increasing the amount of supplementation.",

            "text": "This study demonstrated that dietary supplementation of garlic, and pennywort may improve the growth performance of broilers. Reduction of Escherichia coli and increase of Lactobacillus in the small intestine by adding garlic and pennywort in basal diet could be commercially interesting as it may have the potential to be an alternative to antibiotic growth promoter for broiler chickens. Hence, the beneficial effect of pennywort and garlic supplementation in improving growth performance of broiler chickens may be more obvious under floor pen system as compared to cages which are considered more hygienic. Further research is required to evaluate the effects of garlic and pennywort on fatty acid composition in chickens' meat."
