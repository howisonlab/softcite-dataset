            "text": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) constitute a particular family of tandem repeats found in a wide range of prokaryotic genomes (half of eubacteria and almost all archaea). They consist of a succession of highly conserved regions (DR) varying in size from 23 to 47 bp, separated by similarly sized unique sequences (spacer) of usually viral origin. A CRISPR cluster is flanked on one side by an AT-rich sequence called the leader and assumed to be a transcriptional promoter. Recent studies suggest that this structure represents a putative RNA-interference-based immune system. Here we describe CRISPRFinder, a web service offering tools to (i) detect CRISPRs including the shortest ones (one or two motifs); (ii) define DRs and extract spacers; (iii) get the flanking sequences to determine the leader; (iv) blast spacers against Genbank database and (v) check if the DR is found elsewhere in prokaryotic sequenced genomes. CRISPRFinder is freely accessible at http://crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/ CRISPRfinder.php.",

            "text": "Genomic structures corresponding to CRISPRs were observed first in 1987 in Escherichia coli (1) and were subsequently reported in other organisms under different names [TREP (2), SRSR (3,4), DRVs (5), LCTR (6), SPIDR (7)] until the CRISPR acronym was proposed by Jansen et al. (8). The direct repeat sequences carry in general a low level of palindromic symmetry; they are remarkably well conserved within a species (up to 248 exact copies in Verminephrobacter eiseniae EF01-2). However, one of the flanking DRs is frequently truncated or diverged (see Supplementary Data). The DR size varies from 24 to 47 bp whereas the spacer sequence is generally within the range of 0.6-2.5\u00c2 the DR size. The originality of spacers is that they apparently derive from conjugative plasmids or bacteriophages (2,(9)(10)(11). A prokaryotic genome may harbour up to 16 CRISPR clusters with the same or a different DR. In a genome, a single CRISPR is generally associated with a family of genes called cas for CRISPR-associated (8,12), encoding proteins showing functional similarity with components of the eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) systems (13). In addition, it was demonstrated in two archaea, Archaeoglobus fulgidus (14) and Sulfolobus solfataricus (15), that the CRISPR locus is transcribed into small RNAs (smRNA) probably from one of the flanking regions, the leader, acting as a promoter. These observations and the viral origin of spacers have led to the hypothesis that the CRISPRassociated system (CASS) is a prokaryotic defence mechanism against genetic aggressions (10,13,16). Within species, CRISPRs may be present in a subset of strains, where they sometimes show polymorphism. The DR and the order of the spacers are well conserved, but the number of motifs (DR \u00fe spacer) differs from strain to strain. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the CRISPRs' evolutionary scenario, three evolution rules were proposed by Pourcel et al. (10) and confirmed by Lillestol et al. (15): (i) polarized acquisition of spacers near the leader sequence; (ii) random loss of motifs and (iii) shared ancestry when spacers are identical.",

Several software were used by different authors to identify these particular repeats but usually a manual discard of background was necessary, and generally some CRISPR clusters were missed or neglected, especially the shortest one (less than three motifs). This is the case, for example, of Tandem Repeat Finder (17) when considering a motif (DR \u00fe spacer) as a degenerate repeat (10,18), or Locating Uniform poly-Nucleotide Areas (LUNA), a program for finding degenerate repeats in microbial genomes on a desktop computer. The repeats can be filtered using several parameters including length, distance and level of conservation. LUNA was used especially for finding CRISPRs in archaea (4,15).

Recently, two CRISPR-dedicated software tools were proposed, CRT (http://www.room220.com/crt) and PILER-CR (25). Both of them run fast and perform well in finding CRISPRs. However, CRT results in a considerable background since tandem repeats are considered as putative CRISPRs and in addition, the same CRISPR is sometimes detected more than once with different consensus DRs.

A maximal repeat (26) is a repeat that cannot be extended in either direction without incurring a mismatch. The total number of maximal repeats in a sequence of size n is linear (less than n) which is interesting since the computation may be done in linear time using a suffix-tree-based algorithm. A CRISPR pattern of two DRs and a spacer may be considered as a maximal repeat where the repeated sequences are separated by a sequence of approximately the same length.",

The difficulty resides especially in the identification of boundaries, which is very important to extract the correct spacers and compare DRs. In fact, the consensus DR is selected as the maximal repeat which occurs the most in the whole underlying genome sequence with respect to the forward and the reverse complement directions (since two CRISPRs having the same DR consensus may be in opposite directions). Thus, ambiguity in the choice of a DR will be eliminated in the case of presence of similar DRs in other CRISPRs of the related genomic sequence. However, if occurrence numbers are equal, more than a single DR consensus candidate are kept and later compared. Given a candidate consensus DR, the pattern search program fuzznuc of the EMBOSS package (28) is applied to get DRs' positions in the related cluster. As the first or the last DR in a CRISPR may be diverged/truncated, a mismatch of one-third of the DR length is allowed between the flanking DRs and the candidate consensus DR, whereas smaller nucleotide differences are allowed between the other DRs to take into account possible single mutations. In case of multiple DR candidates, a score is computed and the best one (minimum) is picked. This score favours candidates which are encountered more frequently, rather than consensus DR showing less internal mismatches.",

In their analysis, Godde et al. (20) using Patscan had chosen to retain only CRISPRs with at least three exact repeats (eliminating CRISPRs constituted of a first truncated repeat plus two exact repeats) thus ignoring most CRISPRs containing less than three spacers. Similarly in the work by Durand et al. (21), the PYGRAM program is mostly efficient in visually displaying large CRISPRs. Such stringent criteria were appropriate in order to avoid ambiguities in early investigations which were essentially describing these new structures. However, it is now important, in order to better understand the evolution and spreading of CRISPRs, to provide tools which will not eliminate the smallest CRISPRs. This is what we chose to achieve with CRISPFinder. The major drawback is that when looking for the shortest structures, such as those with a unique spacer, it is clear that the background of spurious candidates can be very high. The output of Patscan and CRT also contains a large quantity of noised data that needs a manual treatment.",

Interestingly, some strains were claimed to be devoid of CRISPRs by Godde and colleagues but proved to have short CRISPRs with CRISPRFinder, such as in different Shigella sp. (S. sonnei Ss046, S. flexneri 2a str. 301, S. flexneri 2a str), or even long CRISPRs such as in Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. The latter example is shown on the CRISPRfinder website (sample2), and as can be seen by using the BLAST spacer function, six spacers out of thirty six at two different CRISPR loci, correspond to a bacteriophage sequence (bacteriophages F116, B3, D3112, DMS3 and phi CTX).",
