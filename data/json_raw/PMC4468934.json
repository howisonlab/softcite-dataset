            "text": "Galangin is an active pharmacological ingredient from propolis and Alpinia officinarum Hance, and has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The present study aims to reveal the effect of galangin on Concanavalin A (ConA)induced hepatitis (CIH), a well-established animal model of immune-mediated liver injury, and to clarify the related mechanism. C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with galangin followed by ConA challenge. Results indicated that galangin inhibited ConA-induced liver damage. Mice pretreated with galangin showed more reduction of liver damage when compared with control mice pretreated with vehicle solution. In galangin-pretreated mice with induced CIH, increases in serum levels of several inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3, and interleukin-12 were dramatically attenuated, and chemokines and adhesion molecules like interferon inducible protein-10, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 messenger RNA expressions in liver were decreased. Moreover, CIH mice pretreated with galangin showed less leukocyte infiltration and T-cell activation in the liver. Further, the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effects of galangin may be attributed to its modulation of crucial inflammatory signaling pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B and interferon-gamma/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. Collectively, these findings suggest the preventive and therapeutic potential of galangin in immune-mediated liver injury in vivo.",

In the pathogenesis of various hepatitides, excessive or misdirected immune stimulation is considered to play a critical role. [1][2][3] Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced hepatitis (CIH) in mice is a well-established experimental model for immune-mediated liver injury and has been widely used in studies of the pathogenesis and clinical treatment of immune hepatitis in humans. In CIH, inflammatory cells, such as T-cells, natural killer T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, infiltrate the liver and produce a variety of hepatotoxic inflammatory cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-12, 4,5 which finally leads to massive apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes and marked elevation of serum transaminases.",

[6][7][8] There is also some recent evidence indicating that galangin has anti-inflammatory activity, which has attracted increasing attention. Galangin was shown to inhibit mast cell-derived allergic inflammation. 9 Galangin also showed anti-inflammatory effects on collagen-induced arthritis via attenuation of RANKL-induced activation of Janus kinase, p38, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathways. 10 Moreover, galangin dampened lipopolysaccharideinduced acute lung injury and inhibited atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions. 11,12 However, the effect of galangin on CIH has not yet been studied.",

In order to clarify the effect of galangin in CIH, we pretreated mice with galangin at two different doses (25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg) before injection of ConA. Mice were euthanized at different time points after induction of CIH, and serum levels of ALT and AST were measured for each mouse. As shown in Figure 1B, mice treated with galangin showed much lower serum ALT and AST activity in both the acute phase and the recovery stage, as compared with mice in the vehicle-injected control group. Moreover, galangin inhibited ConA-induced aminotransferase release in a dose-dependent manner. Mice receiving a 25 mg/kg dose of galangin showed more than half the reduction in ALT and AST release when compared with control mice, and in mice pretreated with 50 mg/kg galangin, the elevation of ALT and AST levels induced by ConA was almost completely suppressed. These data strongly suggest that the protective effect of galangin was permanent in the development of ConA-induced liver injury. We tried a higher dose of galangin (100 mg/kg), but did not observe further inhibition of release of ConA-induced aminotransferases (data not shown). Thus, the dose of galangin used in the following experiments was 50 mg/kg.",

CIH mice with or without galangin pretreatment were euthanized 2 hours after ConA injection, and intrahepatic leukocytes in the liver were obtained. The total number of intrahepatic leukocytes in galangin pretreated mice was remarkably decreased compared with that in mice without galangin administration ( Figure 5A, P,0.01). Neutrophils (Gr-1+CD11b+), macrophages (CD11b+Gr-1-), and T-cells (CD3+NK1.1-) recruited into the liver were significantly reduced by galangin, as shown in Figure 5A. Moreover, galangin significantly inhibited T-cell activation in CIH mice, as CD3+CD69+T cell percent decreased dramatically ( Figure 5B). However, there was no significant change in natural killer cells (CD3-NK1.1+) or natural killer T-cells (CD3+NK1.1+). Taken together, these results indicate that pretreatment with galangin influenced ConA-induced intrahepatic inflammatory cell infiltration and activation. Since the production of many inflammatory mediators, including the cytokines and chemokines mentioned above, depends on activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, we analyzed the activation of NF-\u03baB in mice received vehicle or galangin pretreatment and ConA injection. As shown in Figure 6, galangin significantly inhibited ConA-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, which is required for subsequent activation of NF-\u03baB because it allows the NF-\u03baB dimer to translocate into the nucleus and bind to the \u03baB site. Therefore, more NF-\u03baB complexes remained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm after pretreatment with galangin, leading to a weak response toward ConA stimulation. In addition, transcription factor STAT1, which is associated with the IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway, is considered to be an important pathogenic mediator of T-cell activation in CIH. 21,22 It has been reported that synthesis and activation of STAT1 is increased in the liver of the CIH mouse, and that STAT1 deficiency attenuates ConAinduced liver damage. 21,22 Therefore, we also investigated the effect of galangin on activation of STAT1 in CIH. The data show that galangin effectively reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 ( Figure 6A and B), suggesting that galangin decreased the release of IFN-\u03b3 and suppressed the STAT1 signaling pathway.",

Galangin has been reported to reduce IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17 concentrations and to attenuate activation of the Janus kinase, p38, and NF-\u03baB pathways, thus reducing the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in mice. 10 Galangin also abrogated ovalbumininduced airway inflammation by modulating the expression of several related cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, and chemokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, C-X-C motif chemokine 10, and vascular cell adhesion protein 1, thereby reducing infiltration and activation of eosinophil. 26 In addition, several other groups have demonstrated that galangin inhibits atopic dermatitis-like lesions and dampens lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice. 11,12 Our observations of the beneficial effects of galangin on CIH are consistent with previous reports. In particular, we demonstrated for the first time that galangin has marked protective effects against immune-mediated liver injury. Previous studies have reported that TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 play a critical role in the pathogenesis of CIH. 14,27 TNF-\u03b1, secreted from activated macrophages and T-cells, binds to its receptors and induces an apoptotic cascade, thus acting as a major mediator in inflammation-induced hepatocyte death. 27 Mice pretreated with anti-TNF-\u03b1 antiserum or a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor and mice deficient in the TNF-\u03b1 receptor exhibited obvious resistance to CIH. IFN-\u03b3 exerts pathogenic effects by synergizing with TNF-\u03b1 to promote production of various chemokines and adhesion molecules. 14,28 In addition, IFN-\u03b3 induces phosphorylation of STAT1, which leads to expression of proapoptotic genes and contributes to CIH. 29 Besides TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, IL-12 has also been found to be important in the pathogenesis of CIH. Exogenous IL-12 administration prior to ConA injection exacerbated liver damage, and anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody pretreatment prevented ConA-induced liver injury. 15 In our study, galangin pretreatment reversed the increase in production of these pathogenic inflammatory cytokines in CIH, thereby suppressing activation of T-cells and alleviating the liver injury.",

            "text": "We found that galangin was able to inhibit IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, and ICAM-1 mRNA expression in the livers of CIH mice. During the first few hours after injection of ConA, production of proinflammatory cytokines followed by expression of chemotactic factors such as IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, and ICAM-1, which attract leukocytes to the liver, amplifies the local inflammatory damage. 20,29 IP-10 has been found to play an important role in the hepatic neutrophil influx in CIH. 19 MIP-1\u03b1 is reported to promote recruitment of various leukocyte subtypes, including T-cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. In mice with MIP-1\u03b1 deficiency, hepatic injury induced by ConA was markedly attenuated. 18 Further, ICAM-1 has been shown to mediate adhesion and to support transendothelial migration of lymphocytes in the liver. 20 A previous study demonstrated that ICAM-1 deficiency significantly inhibited liver injury and T-cell recruitment in CIH. In the present study, we report, for the first time, that galangin is able to downregulate IP-10, MIP-1\u03b1, and ICAM-1 mRNA expression in the liver. Such downregulation, in turn, inhibited infiltration of leukocytes into the liver, thus reducing the severity of liver damage in CIH mice. We further investigated the mechanisms involved in the protective effect of galangin in CIH. One important signaling pathway in the regulation of these inflammatory mediators is activation of NF-\u03baB. In resting cells, the NF-\u03baB complex is retained in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein I\u03baB\u03b1, and nuclear accumulation of NF-\u03baB depends mainly on phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1 and its subsequent degradation. Without the inhibitory effect of I\u03baB\u03b1, NF-\u03baB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to bind the \u03baB site of target genes. 30 In the present study, we found that galangin decreased phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, leading to less translocalization of NF-\u03baB. Moreover, the pathogenic inflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 exerted its effects via activation of the Janus kinase-STAT signaling pathway. With the ligation of IFN-\u03b3 to its receptor, STAT1 was phosphorylated and dimerized, and then translocated into the nuclei to activate transcription of a number of genes, including those for IFN regulatory factor-1, Fas receptor, caspases, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclo-oxygenase, and intercellular cell adhesion molecules, all of which are critically involved in the pathogenesis of CIH. 29,31 We observed an obvious decrease of STAT1 phosphorylation after pretreatment with galangin. Therefore, we speculate that the protective effect of galangin in CIH is mediated by inhibition of the NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b3/ STAT1 signaling pathways.",
