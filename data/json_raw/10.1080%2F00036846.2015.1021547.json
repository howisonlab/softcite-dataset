We check whether these spreads could be made to work towards the goal of providing more stability to the euro area. In particular, we focus on reducing the imbalances that arose between the core and peripheral members of the euro area in the first decade of its existence. The idea is that stable positive spreads in peripheral countries could have decreased domestic demand, preventing the boom-bust cycles that plagued these economies. They could also prevent such developments in the future. We construct a panel model for euro area countries and estimate the relationship between real interest rates and the current account balance. Next, we use the estimated parameters to perform simulations. We find that spreads on real interest rates of 0.6-5.5 percentage points would have been necessary to stabilize external positions of the four peripheral euro area member countries.",

As a result, several peripheral economies of the euro area faced boom-bust cycles. 1 Rapid growth of internal demand, driven by mild financing conditions, boosted somewhat domestic output but the bulk of additional demand was supplied from abroad. At the same time domestic inflation picked up and started to exceed that of core euro area countries. As a result of high demand and lost competitiveness, CA deficits swelled. Figure 1 shows a synthetic picture of these developments, plotting the change of real interest rates before and after 1999 against the CA balance after 1999 for 11 euro area countries.

If peripheral countries had faced higher average interest rates in the past, imbalances would not have been so dramatic and, as a result, the adjustment that these countries have been undergoing since 2009 could have been much less painful. Higher average interest rates for peripheral countries could also prevent macroeconomic imbalances from increasing again in the future. In contrast to the case when countercyclical spreads destabilize the economy, here we discuss equilibrium spreads that are constant over time so that they do not interfere with the monetary policy. The bottom line of this argument is that the idea of spreads between monetary union countries should possibly not be rejected completely. If financial Fig. 1.

If it is not spreads (higher price), it must be quantitative restrictions on capital inflows (e.g. limited credit supply). One has to consider what is less appealing in a monetary union. Second, whether one likes it or not, spreads are already there (as well as quantitative restrictions as a matter of fact). With some guidance, they could possibly benefit the common currency. Lastly, despite the last reforms of macroprudential policy in the euro area in the wake of sovereign debt crisis, especially stronger enforcement of the limits on fiscal deficits, implementation of fiscal policy is still a competence of the Member States. The idea underlying this model (e.g. centralized monetary policy with independent fiscal policy) is still that the incentives for fiscal discipline should largely come from the financial markets that are able to distinguish and properly price country-specific risk (which nevertheless proved false in the first decade of the EMU).",

The so-called S-I norms are based on applying medium run values of regressors to coefficients of an estimated CA equation. ES norms rely on the notion of stabilizing the net foreign asset (NFA)-to-GDP ratio (more details below). A more recent approach of the Fund is the external balance assessment (EBA; IMF, 2013).

The simulation of the equilibrium spreads has been, however conducted for the period 1999-2007 when imbalances in the euro area were emerging. The choice of a single appropriate interest rate which determines the relationship between domestic savings and investments, and finally the CA position, is not straightforward. The heterogeneity in the structure of savings across the euro area countries, the changes in their structure over time as well as different horizons for savings and investments motivate us to use several measures of interest rates. In turn, we employed three different interest rates: the yield on 10 year sovereign bonds, the average lending rate for nonfinancial corporations (maturity up to 1 year) and the average interest rate on deposits from the nonfinancial sector (both for new contracts). The yield on sovereign bonds is a long-term interest rate, while two latter variables may be perceived as medium term interest rates.

While selecting control variables, we focus only on 'structural' (long-term) indicators to avoid a contemporaneous relationship with interest rates. The idea is to allow the interest rate to capture the whole cyclical component of the CA movement. From among the most widely used structural CA determinants, we use the following variables which we find suitable for the euro area countries: NFAs position, demographic factors, structural fiscal balance, the variables expressing the stage of development like GDP per capita or productivity, the rule of law and the capital-to-output ratio.

Nevertheless, the sign of the relationship with the CA balance is ambiguous. On the one hand, countries with a more positive NFA position tend to have a higher CA balance due to more favourable income balance stemming from higher net foreign investments. On the other, countries with a less favourable NFA position may afford a lower trade balance to maintain the constant NFA to GDP relationship. The potentially negative relationship between the initial NFA position and the CA may also result from the fact that highly indebted countries may be forced to improve their CA balance to increase their solvency. The latter explanation may be suitable for the euro area countries in the period covered by our research. \u2022 Demographic factors. We expect a negative relationship between the number of economically dependents in the population and the level of national savings and further the CA balance. Following the literature, we account for demographic factors in the model by using a variable expressing population growth. \u2022 Stage of development. Due to the shortage of domestic savings, lower income countries are usually forced to finance investments by external borrowing, which results in a CA deficit. This process stays in line with the theory that capital flows from higher to lower productivity countries. We express the stage of development by two alternative measures: GDP per capita and the level of productivity. \u2022 Structural fiscal balance. According to several theoretical models, we expect a positive relationship between the fiscal balance and the CA balance. Only when Ricardian equivalence holds, changes in the budget deficit do not affect aggregated savings and investments. In the model, we test the significance of the fiscal balance with respect to CA. To avoid the contemporaneous link with the interest rates, we use the structural fiscal balance (in relation to GDP), that is, the fiscal balance adjusted for the business cycle position of the economy. \u2022 Rule of law. Better institutions and regulations increase productivity and export performance in many ways. First, they reduce quasi-fixed costs like corruption or time needed to complete administration duties. Second, they minimize excessive uncertainty in doing business, resulting from, for example, low contract enforcement, which allows firms to plan longterm investments or cooperate and make use of synergy. As a variable in the model we use the perceived rule of law from the World Governance Index data set. We expect the parameter's sign to be positive. \u2022 Capital-to-output ratio. This variable represents endowment in capital and is a proxy for foreign capital needs.

            "text": "In panel data analysis of macroeconomic data, the dynamic nature of a process is often ignored by researchers, partly due to econometric limitations (see below). Indeed, a number of panel data studies on CA use static models with autocorrelation correction (e.g. IMF, 2013). In this article, we decided to include the lagged CA on the right-hand side of the regression. Our arguments for such an approach are as follows: First, one of our goals is to assess the long-term effect of real interest rate changes on CA. Thus, while in static specifications one assumes that all shocks in explanatory variables affect the CA only in the same period, in the dynamic case the long-term impact of change in the explanatory variable x k is given by x k 1\u00c0\u03c1 , where \u03c1 stands for the autoregressive coefficient of the lagged dependent variable. Second, the decision whether to include a lagged dependent variable or not depends in our opinion on the statedependency of the CA. In our view, agents' decision on whether to invest abroad or trade with foreign markets is affected by the past choices. Factors like (partial) irreversibility of investment, sunk costs of foreign market research, long-term contractual agreements between parties or involvement into global supply chains may be good examples. Third, our approach allows us to address the issue of autocorrelation existing in the data as well. 2 Regarding the appropriate estimation technique, our choice may be perceived as a trade-off between methods that minimize the bias and those that give lower SEs. This is because, as it is often the case for macroeconomic data, the time dimension of our data set is quite large (T = 18) but the cross-sectional dimension is rather low. 3 As well documented in the literature, OLS yields inconsistent estimates in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. In a dynamic specification, the bias of the OLS autoregression coefficients is positive (Baltagi, 2005). A straightforward way to deal with heterogeneity between units and omitted variable bias would be to include a set of country dummies, that is, fixed effects (FEs). However, there are two problems with a dynamic FE estimator. First, including unitspecific dummies is very likely to make parameter estimates of rather time-invariant variables statistically insignificant, even if their importance for a given economic phenomenon is deeply verified and documented in the theoretical literature (see Pl\u00fcmper et al., 2005 and references). Fortunately, interest rates that we focus on show enough volatility over time. The second (and far more important) problem with the FEs approach is however a downward bias of the autoregressive coefficient, known as Nickell bias named after the seminal work by Nickell (1981). This bias is especially important in short data sets with highly persistent variables, as it diminishes as T ! 1 but is significant if \u03c1 ! 1. In our case, T = 18 which may diminish the bias, yet the dependent variable is highly persistent (autocorrelation coefficient of first order is as big as 0.95 and autocorrelation coefficient of even third order is still higher than 0.8).",

However, apart from the fact that asymptotic efficiency of the FD estimator depends on the sample's cross-section dimension (which is very low in our case), weak instrumentation issues can make the FD estimation a cure worse than disease. This is also the case for us. For all three interest rates, the F-statistic in the first-stage regression is far below 10 (which is a rule-of-thumb value to identify problems with weak instrumentation, following influential work by Staiger and Stock, 1997) and Kleibergen-Paap Wald rk F-statistic is unacceptably low (less than 2, while 19.93 critical value by Stock and Yogo (2002) corresponds to 10% IV bias). Similarly, high autocorrelation of dependent variable weakens instruments also for the difference GMM estimator (see Blundell and Bond, 1998). 4 Summing up, given the pros and cons of each estimator, we decided to estimate an AR(1) panel data model (with year dummies), using three estimators: OLS, FE and bias-corrected FE. FE and OLS estimates constitute lower and upper bounds for our results (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s and Sevestre, 2008), while the use of bias-corrected FE estimator allows us to assess the size of the Nickell bias, and, consequently, the reliability of the FE estimator.

The signs of parameters given by all three estimators seem well in line with the expectations. In particular, the parameter for the real interest rate is always positive regardless of the choice of interest rate. A negative sign of the parameter for population change suggest that, not surprisingly, a shrinking (ageing) society is more likely to be dissaving and therefore soaking up the capital from abroad. Although population change did not always turn statistically significant, due to strong priors we keep this variable in the model. Finally, the negative sign of lagged NFA coefficient shows that no country may run CA deficits/surpluses forever. In the next step, we explain the choice of our preferred model. As expected, OLS estimates of parameter \u03c1 are somehow larger than those of FE. However, reported point estimates of parameters using bias-corrected FE (we employed Bruno, 2005 Stata routine) are almost the same as the FE estimates, which suggest that the Nickell bias seems negligible in our context (and that OLS estimates suffer from omitted variable bias). Also the significance of country dummies suggests that OLS estimates may not be the most reliable ones. Finally, it should be noted that the FE estimates have a relatively small variance, especially if compared to consistent estimators as GMM (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s and Sevestre, 2008) or bias-corrected FE. For these reasons, we choose the simple FE estimator as the preferred one. Regarding the specification tests, the Arellano-Bond test for autocorrelation shows that including the lagged dependent variable and year dummies reduces problems with autocorrelation. At no reasonable significance level, the null hypothesis (i.e. that there is no autocorrelation) should be rejected. To deal with heterogeneity we use robust SEs.",

Including lagged NFA as a regressor makes the basic formula for a long-term multiplier invalid, therefore we present simulations based on the regression results in detail in Section V. To give some intuition, though, we can say that (ceteris paribus) an increase in a medium term real interest rate by 1 pp results in a rise in the NFA-to-GDP ratio by 0.93-1.09 that is obtained after 7-8 years and is diminishing afterwards. For the long-term interest rate, a rise by 1 pp translates into an improvement of the NFA-to-GDP ratio of about 1.36 after 10 years. Not surprisingly, also the longterm effect of an increase in the real interest rate on NFA-to-GDP ratio is clearly higher for the long-term interest rate (Maastricht rate) than that for the deposit rate or lending rate, which suggests that it is the structural factors rather than short-term ones that have the biggest influence on the external position of an economy.",

We argue that in our case, the best possible trade-off between efficiency and consistency is given by the FE estimator and our results show a significant impact of real interest rates on the CA. In the next section, we use them to calculate the hypothetical levels of the interest rate spreads that would have been necessary to stabilize external position of the EA countries in the first decade after the euro adoption. One final question that could be posed is why our results show a strong, significant and robust impact of the real interest rate on the CA while several other studies have not found such link. We believe that the answer is related to the explanation given in IMF (2013). When discussing their failure to find a statistically significant relationship between real rates and the CA, the authors point to the two channels of interest rates transmission. On the one hand, higher real rates increase savings and reduce investments, thus improving the CA. However, at the same time higher interest rates bring about an exchange rate appreciation and, as a result, reduce net exports and the CA. These effects may cancel out, at least in the short and medium term, IMF (2013) concludes. However, our research is conducted for a panel of monetary union members, where the second channel is closed by construction. What remains is the first channel, which works in the desired direction and is confirmed in our regressions. Of course this reasoning is only a hypothesis which",

Second, our model has another hidden dynamic elementthe lagged NFA position. This must be taken into account when running the simulations.

Hence, the difference between the CA and the norm for the years 1999-2007 must be zero on average (2001( -2007. However, taking into account the substantial discrepancy between values of short-and long-term multipliers we set the interest rates at the desired level already 2 years before adopting the euro (in 1999 for Greece and in 1997 for remaining ten countries). This assumption stays in line with the observation that approximately 1.5-2 years before euro adoption financial markets started to perceive countries as future euro area Member States what resulted in acceleration of nominal interest rate convergence and a substantial decrease of spreads. The simulation results are collected in Table 3. We present the outcome for our three interest rates. The numbers in the table are the differences between historical real interest rates and our counterfactual rates. The results clearly show that for four euro area countries Ireland, Portugal, Greece and Spain the historical real interest rates were too low to prevent these economies from building up external imbalances. The highest discrepancy between actual and desired interest rates can be observed for Portugal and Greece. Depending on the choice of the interest rate, the difference ranges from 5.8 to 7.5 pp for Portugal and from 4.3 to 5.4 pp for Greece. Slightly lower but still negative spreads are calculated for Spain (2.0-2.5 pp) and Ireland (1.5-2.0 pp). For two countries France and Italy the historical real interest rates were almost in line with the simulated counterfactual rates. Five euro area countries experienced real interest rates which resulted in average surplus of CA over their norm in the reference period. For these countries, the historical real rates were above the desired rates by 1.3-1.6 pp in case of Belgium, by 1.7-2.2 pp for Austria and by 1.9-2.5 pp for Germany. The highest positive discrepancy between historical rates and the rates stabilizing the CA balance show up for Finland (7.7-10.1 pp) and the Netherlands (4.7-6.0 pp). However, the results for both countries may be to some extent biased. In the first case, there were large jumps in the NFA stock in years 1999 and 2000 due to valuation effects. For the Netherlands, gas exports and the role of the port of Rotterdam are likely to substantially improve the average CA.",

However, although up to 2007 the differences in historical nominal interest rates between euro area Member States were in general negligible, real interest rates differed due to discrepancy in the inflation rates. In Fig. 4, we present the counterfactual average historical real interest rates calculated as a sum of spreads from Table 3 and the historical average real rates for years 1999 and 2007 for subsequent countries related to the historical average real interest rate for the euro area (EA11 weighted by GDP contribution). In other words, we show the spread against the EA 11 average instead of each country's historical average. For three euro area countries France, Italy and Ireland the desired real long-term interest rate should have been slightly above the average real rate for the euro area (from 0.4 to 0.6 pp). Spain should have had real interest rates higher than an average interest rate for the euro area by 1.6 pp, while for Greece this spread should have equalled 3.8 pp. According to our calculations, the highest positive spread would have been necessary for Portugal, amounting to 5.5 pp. Finally, we look at the time series of simulated CA deficits in our four most interesting countries. Since we introduce a constant spread between historical and counterfactual rates, the simulated CA equals the norm only on average. The question is: how much it deviates from the norm over time? As shown in Fig. 5, not surprisingly, the counterfactual CA deficits do not overlap perfectly with the respective norms. However, at least in Greece, Portugal and Spain the deviations are not large and a clear improvement of the situation can be observedthe simulated CA is clearly closer to the norm than to its historical level. The situation is less obvious in Ireland, and this is for two reasons. First, the average gap between the CA and the norm was relatively small in this country. Moreover, valuation effects for NFAs increased the volatility of the norm. However, even there a clear improvement of the counterfactual over the historical CA can be observed.",

Obtained estimates of an immediate impact of a change in the real interest rate on the CA were similar to those in our preferred dynamic model. However, the high estimated coefficient of autocorrelation of residuals from the static model as well as high and robust significance of the lagged CA in the dynamic specification suggest that the latter one should be our preferred choice.3  Time dimension of 18 observations may, indeed, seem quite large for a panel data set. However, it is rather small for cointegration time-series methods, such as panel ECM models proposed byPesaran and Smith (1995);Pesaran et al. (1997). What is more, power of unit root test for our data set seems rather low, as their asymptotic properties depend on T and N being large. Instead, we prefer to include lagged dependent variable to control for autocorrelation and year dummies to control for common shocks and possible trends in the data.Can interest rate spreads stabilize the euro area?",
