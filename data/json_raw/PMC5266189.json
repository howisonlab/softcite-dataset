This study was approved by the ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent. A total of 161 consecutive patients (63 with gastric cancer [GC], 48 with GI, and 50 with NGM) who underwent dual-phase contrast enhanced DESCT scans in the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PVP) were included in this study. Iodine concentration (IC) in lesions was derived from the iodine-based material-decomposition images and normalized to that in the aorta to obtain normalized IC (nIC). The ratios of IC and nIC between the AP and PVP were calculated. Diagnostic confidence for GC and GI was evaluated with reviewing the features including gastric wall thickness, focal, and eccentric on the conventional polychromatic images. All statistical analyses were performed by using statistical software SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). IC and nIC in GC differed significantly from those in GI and NGM, except for nIC AP in comparing GC with GI. Mean nIC values of GC (0.18 \u00b1 0.06 in AP and 0.62 \u00b1 0.16 in PVP) were significantly higher than that of NGM (0.12 \u00b1 0.03 in AP and 0.37 \u00b1 0.08 in PVP) (all P < 0.05). There was also significant difference for IC values in",

[1,2] During the past 3 decades, the survival rate of GC has increased dramatically due to the early diagnosis. [3] Among the early GC patients whose lesions are limited to the gastric mucosa and submucosa, 95% patients will survive more than 5 years. [4] Consequently, early diagnosis for malignant gastric mucosal lesions is of great importance since the outcome is dependent on the initial stages.",

            "text": "Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has in recent years become a powerful and noninvasive tool for identifying gastric wall invasion and perigastric extent in GC patients, combined with multiple planar reconstruction and virtual endoscopy, the detection rates achieved 44% to 93.5%. [7][8][9][10] However, with conventional MDCT, the averaging attenuation effect and beam-hardening artifacts would reduce the ability to reliably detect lesions, especially the small lesions, such as gastric mucosa lesions. [11] On the other hand, since the introduction in the late-2000, dual energy spectral computed tomography (DESCT) imaging, which is based on the rapid switching between 80 and 140 kVp, has gained its popularity in angiography, cancer detection, characterization, and differentiation. [12][13][14][15] The gemstone spectral imaging (GSI) mode allows the reconstruction of monochromatic images with photon energy levels from 40 to 140 keV and generates accurate material decomposition images, such as water-and iodine-based material-decomposition images. Material-decomposition images represent the amount or the density of different materials. The iodine concentration (IC) measurement in the iodine-based material decomposition image may be used to reflect the different contrast uptakes in gastric mucosa and GC, and the use of monochromatic X-ray beam in DESCT would eliminate the beam-hardening artifacts and average attenuation effects. [11,14,16,17] DESCT has demonstrated its value in gastric imaging to improve the N staging accuracy and to differentiate tumor histopathology type and lymph nodes. [16] However, the use of DESCT imaging in gastric mucosa has not been reported. The aim of this study was to introduce a quantitative analysis method in DESCT to differentiate GC from benign gastric mucosal condition, including gastric inflammation (GI) and normal gastric mucosa (NGM).",

For medical diagnostic imaging with GSI scanning mode, water and iodine were often selected as the basis material pairs for material-decomposition image presentation because their atomic numbers span the range of atomic numbers for materials generally found in medical imaging and approximate those of soft tissue and iodinated contrast material to result in material-attenuation images that were intuitive to interpret. [11,14] For GC and GI in the mucosa and NGM, their IC values were derived from the iodine-based material decomposition images. The quantitative parameter IC could be used to effectively reflect the degree of enhancement and the blood supply of lesions. [14] Our result showed that IC of GC was significantly higher than that of NGM both in AP and PVP. The increased IC value in GC would indicate the increased angiogenesis in the development of tumors, since the angiogenesis is the fundamental process and the growth formation would determine their enhancement in CT. [19] ROC analysis in this study indicated that IC had high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating GC from NGM. In PVP, a threshold of 21.17 mg/mL for IC in PVP would yield a sensitivity of 90.48% and specificity of 92.0% for differentiating GC from NGM. On the other hand, the inflammatory lesions are also associated with increased angiogenesis, which will result in similar effects to tumor-associated neovascularization. [19] Our study revealed that even though there was no statistically significant difference in the IC value between GC and GI, and the AUC values were not high enough to provide clinically meaningful diagnostic power to differentiate GC from GI. On the other hand, using IC in PVP, we were able to obtain AUC of 0.86 with sensitivity of 68.75% and specificity of 96% for the differentiation of GI from NGM.",

Using nIC in AP, the sensitivity and specificity were only 71.43% and 80.00%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.80 for differentiating GC from NGM. The AUCs in PVP were higher than in AP for other group pairs. Some authors [11,15] reported that measuring ICs in PVP could increase the accuracy for distinguishing small hepatocellular carcinoma from other hepatic lesions than in AP, due to the fact that contrast could effectively disperse in the liver and tissue in PVP. Combing the conventional size criterion, the nIC of lymph nodes during the PVP would improve the diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing metastatic from nonmetastatic lymph nodes in rectal cancer due to the contrast media both in intrasvasular and extravascular space with the leakage to the extravascular space. [18] In this study, the nIC of GC was higher than that of GI with a high sensitivity, while with a low specificity (41.67%). Gastric carcinoma originated from the mucosa and the sequence was from chronic nonatrophic gastritis that progressed to chronic atrophic gastritis, which might lead to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and finally adenocarcinoma. [4] In addition, there is increasing evidence that the inflammation seems to play a critical role in the development and progression of numerous cancers.

So taking these features into account, the diagnostic accuracy for GI has reached 98%. In the clinical study, combing the quantitative analysis and conventional features would provide more diagnostic information. Our study did have some limitations. First, the patients of NGM group were confirmed by clinical information, and not all NGM patients were confirmed by pathological or endoscopy, the normal group might have slight gastritis which may lead to some bias in the study. Second, in this study, we focused our attention on the quantitative analysis of the IC of gastric mucosa without the evaluation of N staging. The use of optimal monochromatic images in spectral CT imaging could improve the N staging accuracy for GCs which was the key for choosing accurate therapy. [16] Third, in this study, few patients of early GC had lesion localized in mucosa layer, the result should be verified in large-scale clinical study. Fourth, we did not divide the GC patients into different pathological pattern groups. In the following study, we will consider the diversity outcome from different mucosa pathological patterns. Finally, the thickness of gastric mucosa was just 2 to 3 mm, which made it difficult to place ROIs.",
