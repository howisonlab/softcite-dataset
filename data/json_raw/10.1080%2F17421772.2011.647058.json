However, the common practice of modelling spatial dependence as being generated by spatial interactions through a known spatial weights matrix is often not satisfactory. While existing estimators of spatial weights matrices are based on repeat sales or panel data, this paper takes the approach to a cross-section setting. Specifically, based on an a priori definition of housing submarkets and the assumption of a multifactor model, we develop maximum likelihood methodology to estimate hedonic models that facilitate understanding of both spatial heterogeneity and spatial interactions. The methodology, based on statistical orthogonal factor analysis, applied to the urban housing market of Aveiro (Portugal) at two different spatial scales, provides exciting inferences on the spatial structure of the housing market.

The above application is based on a methodological contribution, namely maximum likelihood inference for an unknown spatial weights matrix in a pure cross-section setting, for a given a priori characterization of housing submarkets. Specifically, the paper modifies the methodology developed in Bhattacharjee & Jensen-Butler (2011) for estimation of a symmetric spatial weights matrix in a panel data setting, to the current context of cross-section data, admitting a factor structure and structural spatial dependence arising from a spatial error model. The estimated spatial weights matrix is not constrained by restrictive assumptions relating to drivers of spatial diffusion, and offers unique opportunities to understand the nature of interactions in urban space.",

Spatial scale is not so much an econometric, but an important empirical issue, and has been discussed widely in the housing economics literature, for example in Malpezzi (2003). Whether an urban scale is the most suitable, or whether the appropriate scale for analysis should be peri-urban (including an urban centre, adjoining suburbs and the countryside), regional or national, depends on both the spatial phenomenon under analysis and the specific spatial context.",

Next, at the above chosen scale, we begin by segmenting the housing market into submarkets, based on a combination of several criteria: administrative boundaries, hedonic substitutability and socio-cultural segmentation. 1 Given the above segmentation into submarkets, spatial dependence relates to inferences on spatial weights representing spillovers across different submarkets, and those between houses within the same submarket. For the former, the methodology in Bhattacharjee & Jensen-Butler (2011) can be adapted, provided we can estimate the cross-submarket spatial autocovariance matrix of the errors; for this purpose, we use a methodology based on the cross-section factor model. For the second, we develop maximum likelihood methodology, where we assume for simplicity that the within-submarket spatial weights are the same across all submarkets.",

Applied to the housing market of Aveiro segmented into submarkets at two different spatial scales, the method provides a description of urban spatial structure based on spatial heterogeneity, spatial interactions and spatial scale. The resulting spatial model is useful for understanding relative importance of various elements*housing characteristics and access to central and local amenities, as well as interactions within and between housing submarkets* and provides useful inferences on residential location, urban planning and policy.

In Section 2, we discuss our methodology and place it within the context of the emerging literature on inferences relating to unknown spatial interactions. Following this, in Section 3, we apply our methods to a spatial hedonic price model for the city of Aveiro, using a small but very rich dataset on hedonic characteristics of properties sold through the leading real estate agency in 2007. Next, we extend the analysis to the peri-urban spatial scale including neighbouring parishes with potentially substantial spillovers with Aveiro, based on data for all properties put on the market between 2000 and 2010 (Section 4). With both datasets, we find important evidences on spatial heterogeneity and dependence that inform our understanding of the urban spatial structure of the housing markets in Aveiro, as well as the importance of spatial scale. Section 5 concludes.",

More importantly, in including all potential economic factors affecting prices, the factor-based regression model is less susceptible to the omitted variables problem. Second, hedonic regression based on factors allows a unique opportunity to reduce missing value problems, where factors can be predicted (imputed) using the information available on only a selection of included characteristics, under the assumption that the missing data are allocated randomly across the properties conditional on the values of observed features. This leads to considerably larger sample sizes for estimation of the hedonic model, with benefits of improved precision in the estimates. Third, the approach based on orthogonal factors is not subject to multicollinearity, and could therefore contribute to higher efficiency, which in turn can lead to better prediction of housing prices; see Malpezzi (2003) for further discussion. Besides, the orthogonality of factors is also important for estimating the spatial weights, which we discuss later in Section 2.4.",

Housing markets are local and diverse, and hedonic price estimation requires careful delineation of these markets (Malpezzi, 2003). The definition of submarkets in practice ranges from the national or regional scale (Linneman, 1981;Mills & Simenauer, 1996), through metropolitan areas (Follain & Malpezzi, 1980), to below the metropolitan level (Straszheim, 1975;Gabriel, 1984;Grigsby et al., 1985;Rothenberg et al., 1991;Maclennan & Tu, 1996;Bourassa et al., 1999). Malpezzi (2003) argues that one reason why the metropolitan area is appealing as the unit of analysis is that these areas are usually thought of as labour markets, which may therefore be approximately coincident with housing markets. On the other hand, submarkets below the metropolitan level can be segmented by location (central city/suburb), or by housing quality, or even by race or income levels. Such segmentation facilitates both understanding of residential neighbourhood choice and devising appropriate urban housing policy. However, the empirical literature does not suggest an unambiguous definition of a unique spatial scale.",

In the first, we consider administrative regions (parishes) within the city of Aveiro as submarkets, and pool the suburban area together into a single submarket. This definition aids understanding of spatial heterogeneity and interactions within the urban area, but does not provide satisfactory analysis in terms of spillovers between the city and the suburban area. Second, we extend our analysis to a finer spatial scale within the suburban area, constructing submarkets with careful consideration to the principles of segmentation discussed above. Our analysis reflects some advantages of using a flexible spatial scale, since processes of agglomeration and dispersion operate differently at different scales (Arbia et al., 2010(Arbia et al., , 2012.",

            "text": "2.3.2. Spatial heterogeneity and neighbourhood effects. The conceptual notion behind spatial submarkets discussed above implies that the price determining (hedonic) mechanism can be heterogeneous over space. This spatial heterogeneity can originate from demand and supply factors, institutional barriers or discrimination, each of which can cause differentials across neighbourhoods in the way housing attributes are valued by consumers and house prices determined (Anselin et al., 2010). However, if spatial heterogeneity is present and ignored, an average price across all submarkets is estimated that ignores submarket heterogeneity. Worse still, the error term of the regression can then be correlated with the included regressors and ordinary least squares (OLS) will produce biased estimates. The standard urban model in the Alonso\u00c1Muth\u00c1Mills tradition predicts a generally declining pattern of prices with distance from the centre of the city, though there may be spatial variation in relative preference for centrality. Other models based on localized amenities or multiple centres imply a stronger impact of access to local amenities. Like distances, the implicit prices for dwelling characteristics and size may also vary spatially, reflecting either supply constraints or residential sorting. Follain & Malpezzi (1980), Mozolin (1994), Adair et al. (2000) and Soderberg & Janssen (2001), among others, have examined intra-urban variation in the price of housing using hedonic models. We follow the above line of literature in allowing coefficients in our hedonic pricing model to vary across submarkets, and use the estimated variation to infer on residential neighbourhood choice and urban spatial structure.",

In contrast to spatial heterogeneity, spatial dependence leads to spatial autocorrelation, implying that prices of nearby houses tend to be more similar than those of houses that are farther apart. Likewise, average price of houses in nearby or related submarkets may be correlated more strongly. A common explanation for spatial autocorrelation is spatial spillovers or other forms of contagion effects. However, incorrectly modelled spatial heterogeneity, measurement problems in explanatory variables, omitted variables, and unmodelled features having a spatial pattern can also lead to spatial autocorrelation (Anselin & Griffith, 1988). Recent empirical literature has addressed issues of bias and loss of efficiency that can result when spatial effects are ignored in the estimation of hedonic models (see, for example Pace & LeSage, 2004;Anselin & Lozano-Garcia, 2008) and the use of spatial econometric models to address spatial autocorrelation is becoming increasingly standard. 4 The usual approach to the representation of spatial interactions is to define a spatial weights matrix, denoted W, which typically represents a theoretical and a priori characterization of the nature and strength of spatial interactions between different submarkets or dwellings. 5 These spatial weights represent patterns of diffusion of prices and unobservables over space, and thereby provide a meaningful and easily interpretable representation of spatial interaction (spatial autocorrelation). The spatial weights are typically modelled as functions of geographic or economic distance. The distance between two spatial units reflects their proximity with respect to prices or unobservables, so that the spatial interaction between a set of units (dwellings) can be represented as a function of the economic distances between them.",

Spatial contiguity or suitable functions of geographic distances are frequent choices. However, spatial data may be anisotropic, where spatial autocorrelation is a function of both distance and the direction separating points in space (Simon, 1997;Gillen et al., 2001). Further, spatial interactions may be driven by other factors, such as trade weights, transport cost, travel time and socio-cultural distances.

Residuals for the same period are matched because the corresponding observations on different spatial units align perfectly along the dimension of the unobserved latent factors*in the panel data setting, the time-specific common shocks.

Since dwellings within a submarket are in general located closer to each other than those across different submarkets, it is expected that v 0 will be large compared to the cross-submarket spatial weights. We propose maximum likelihood to conduct this estimation. Specifically, for any candidate value of v 0 , we construct the corresponding row-standardized spatial weights matrix W, estimate the spatial error model using maximum likelihood, and evaluate the value of the maximized likelihood. In this way, we construct spatial weights matrices using various candidate values for v 0 , estimate the corresponding spatial error models by maximum likelihood using Geoda (Anselin, 2005), and maximize the likelihood over all such candidate values. Standard errors are estimated by numerical approximation to compute the Fisher information at this maximized value for v 0 . 14 Finally, as discussed earlier, we use the Born & Breitung (2011) regression test to examine the validity of spatial error dependence against a hybrid model including a spatial lag.",

Table 5 reports the estimated Moran's I statistic 18 for these seven different specifications. Results for contiguity are visually illustrated in Figure 2. The four quadrants in the figure provide a classification of different types of spatial autocorrelation: high\u00c1high (upper right) or low\u00c1low (lower left) for positive spatial autocorrelation; and high\u00c1low (lower right) or low\u00c1high (upper left), for negative spatial autocorrelation. Positive spatial autocorrelation implies that a high (low) value in the current location is surrounded by high (low) values in neighbouring observations. The slope of the best-fitting regression line is Moran's I statistic (Anselin, 2005). While Moran's I index is useful for detecting the presence of spatial autocorrelation, it does not indicate the precise structure of spatial interactions (Anselin, 2005).",

The symmetry assumption adopted in this work is in line with the traditional practice in housing studies, and is a natural consequence of defining spatial weights based on distances. The first step is to estimate the spatial autocovariance matrix of residuals across the four submarkets. As discussed in Section 2, we use residuals across the four submarkets, matched by factors, to construct the cross-submarket error spatial autocovariance and autocorrelation matrix (Table 7). In contrast to the results above based on a priori fixed spatial weights, significant spatial autocorrelation can be observed between some submarkets. Table 8 reports the corresponding estimated symmetric spatial weights matrix for cross-submarket interactions.

The first striking conclusion is that spatial interaction is significant for 17 out of 21 cells of the matrix. The main drivers of spatial interactions are common patterns of response to stochastic shocks; if for example, houses with particular characteristics become preferable for given social groups, we expect to obtain positive interactions between places with similar social structures and negative interactions for places where contrasted social groups dominate. Positive interactions between submarkets are also related to spillovers between these areas in unobservable housing characteristics, which in turn are prominent for areas contiguous in geographical location. Further, housing preferences similar across all submarkets are expected to generate an overall pattern of positive interaction.",

Apparently, both of these are related to market segmentation, where each submarket is attractive to different population groups. Admittedly, some of the above explanations are tentative, and would require further research to confirm and interpret. These developments are beyond the scope of the paper. However, what we clearly show is that the spatial weights matrix, estimated using our methodology, combined with the analysis of spatial heterogeneity, provides a very rich set of information which can be the basis for detailed analysis and for the disclosing of the causes underlying the observed spatial patterns. 21 Finally, the above analysis at a larger spatial scale, in combination with previous analysis (based on central parishes), provides some insights about the importance of spatial scale. Largely focusing at the urban scale, our previous analyses provided useful inferences with regard to spatial heterogeneity and interactions across parishes. However, understanding of spillovers between the urban and suburban parishes was somewhat limited by the fact that the suburban area contained a heterogeneous mix of neighbourhoods. This issue was addressed in the current analysis by dividing the suburban area into various notional submarkets that segregate the varieties of living space (Lefebvre, 1974(Lefebvre, [1991) in a more useful way. In this larger spatial scale too, very interesting inferences are drawn relating to spatial heterogeneity and interactions. This highlights the fact that, with regard to study housing submarkets, a single scale may not always be adequate (Whitehead, 2003).",

There is considerable debate in the literature as to which of these alternatives constitute an appropriate criterion, and even whether submarkets are truly spatial entities (see Rothenberg et al., 1991). Here, we abstract from these issues somewhat and assume that our submarkets, at the given spatial scale, have a spatial context which we examine in terms of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence. 2. Inference on cross-submarket heteroscedasticity is a by-product of our methodology. However, we do not focus on this issue in the paper. 3. We are grateful to an anonymous referee for valuable suggestions that helped us understand better the role of the factor model in our setting. 4.

            "text": "5. For a setting with n spatial units under study, W is an n )n matrix with zero diagonal elements. The offdiagonal elements are typically either dummy variables for contiguity or inversely proportional to the distance between a pair of units, so that spillover between a pair of units that are farther apart is lower. 6. An analogy with well-researched urban areas in the USA is illuminative. A city like Chicago, where house prices have risen in the CBD but grown even faster in the suburbs, would imply positive spatial interaction between the centre and the periphery. By contrast, in Detroit, where prices in the centre have declined at the same time as suburban housing prices have continued to rise, suggests negative spatial interaction. We are grateful to Steve Malpezzi for pointing out this connection with urban structure. 7. See Bhattacharjee & Holly (2011) for a review and discussion, as well as an application to network interactions within a committee. 8. Note that, since the spatial weights matrix is unknown in our setting, it is necessary to row-standardize W to enable identification of both W and the autoregressive parameter (l) in Equation 1The assumption that the intra-submarket spatial weight is the same across all submarkets is not necessary, but retained here for computational simplicity. 9. That is, W 0 is symmetric, which holds if v kl 0v lk for all l \"k. W is the row-standardized version of W 0 , and therefore will not be symmetric in general. 10. Here, A 1/2 denotes the symmetric square root of a positive definite matrix A, and A (1/2 denotes its inverse.",

See Bhattacharjee & Holly (2011) for further discussion on partial identification and structural constraints in this context. 12. We thank an anonymous referee whose comments encouraged us to examine the special features of the factor model in the cross-section context, thereby improving upon the methodology and its discussion substantially. 13. See Bhattacharjee & Holly (2011) for further discussion of the conceptual distinction between strong and weak dependence and their connection to the spatial weights matrix. 14. In principle, one can allow the within-submarket spatial weights to vary across submarkets. In our empirical exercise, we abstract from this issue for the sake of computational simplicity. 15. The name of the agency is withheld because of a confidentiality agreement. 16. Flats tend to be located in areas with high residential density, which in turn generate scale economies for the provision of these infrastructure facilities. 17. Given the small sample sizes in each submarket, it is not surprising that many regression coefficients are not statistically significant. The estimates indicate that, despite small sample sizes, it is important to allow for spatial heterogeneity. Further, the limitation of sample size is counterbalanced by the benefits of estimating spatial econometric models (spatial error and spatial lag models) by maximum likelihood, which is computationally difficult on large datasets. 18. The value of the Moran's I statistic ranges from 1 (perfectly positive spatial autocorrelation) to (1 (perfectly negative spatial autocorrelation), a value near zero indicating no spatial autocorrelation. 19. Rothenberg et al. (1991) define submarkets in terms of bundle 'quality' (that is, close hedonic substitutability), and these sets of close substitute units may or may not have any spatial content. 20. The consolidation of a single urban area corresponding to the municipalities of Aveiro and \u00cdlhavo was built on a territory previously organized as a set of small urban and rural clusters, each with its own provision of small scale services. Factor 2 reflects the proximity to such local centres. 21. Paradoxically, the main reason mitigating against more formal analysis of spatial structure using the estimated spatial weights matrix is large sample size. It is computationally very difficult to conduct ML-based inferences in spatial econometric models when sample size is large. Suitable ML computation for large sample applications, based perhaps on regularization or subsampling, is planned for the future.",
