The SIB, Korean version-Mini Mental State Examination (K-MMSE), CDR, and Seoul-Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL) were administered. The validity of the SIB was confirmed by evaluating the correlation coefficients between the SIB and K-MMSE, CDR, S-ADL, which were found to be significant. Cronbach's alpha for the total SIB score and each subscale score showed high significance, and the item-total correlation for each subscale was also acceptable. The test-retest correlation for the total SIB score and subscale scores were significant, except for the praxis and orienting to name. The total SIB score and subscale scores were examined according to CDR. The results suggest that the SIB can differentiate the poor performances of severely impaired dementia patients. On the basis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), it can be concluded that the SIB is able to accurately discriminate between CDR 2 and 3 patients. The results of this study suggest that the SIB is a reliable and valid instrument for evaluating severe dementia patients in Korean population."

            "text": "Dementia is one of the most severe pathologies in old age, and as it progresses, it eventually leads to severe impairment of cognitive function, and activities of daily living, as well as behavioral problems. The progression of dementia results in global and severe impairment across all spheres of cognitive function. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the changes, which take place over time and the presence and extent of the preserved abilities as dementia progresses. This information may help in the management of severely demented patient, and could be used in the design of psychosocial and environmental interventions. The therapeutic efficacy can be also evaluated in severely demented patients if they are tested with more appropriate instruments."

            "text": "Many neuropsychological instruments have been developed which are designed to assess mild to moderate cognitive impairment and are in common usage. However, as dementia progresses to the advanced stages, the ability of these conventional neuropsychological and mental status assessments to measure cognitive functions becomes increasingly limited, because many dementia patients perform at floor levels (1). Moreover, since it can be difficult to test severely demented patients, due either to their refusal or the severity of deterioration, most of the instruments commonly used in cases of mild dementia show a limited range of scores and exhibit the floor effect in the advanced stages.",

            "text": "One approach to the assessment of the cognitive functions of severely impaired dementia patients involves the use of observer-based rating scales. For example, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) (2) and Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (3) enable the clinician to evaluate the severity of dementia and the presence or absence of symptoms on the basis of clinical interviews with family members or other informants. Another way to avoid the floor effect is to use neurologic procedures such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (4), which evaluates the presence of neurologic signs and symptoms rated in conjunction with basic cognitive and functional skills. Although these approaches adequately assess the global dementia severity, they do not provide a performance-based evaluation of the dementia patient's cognitive abilities and cannot detect relatively spared abilities in various cognitive domains. Therefore several instruments have been developed to overcome these limitations and to assess patients with severe dementia who are unable to complete standard neuropsychological tests, viz. the Severe Cognitive Impairment Profile (SCIP) (5), the Preliminary Neuropsychological Battery (BNP) (6), the Test for Severe Impairment (TSI) (7), and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) (8).",

In particular, the high correlation between the total SIB and K-MMSE scores indicates that the SIB evaluates global cognitive functioning in patients with severe dementia. Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the total SIB score and each subscale score and the item-total correlation for the SIB subscales showed high significance, indicating that the SIB has excellent internal consistency. The test-retest correlation for the total SIB score and each subscale scores was relatively significant. This result suggests that the performance on this instrument has acceptable stability over time. However, the testretest correlation for the praxis subscale was not significant in this study, whereas the one month test-retest correlation for this subscale was 0.63 (p<0.01) in a previous study (1). This discrepancy may be attributed to the change in the functioning of the patients caused by the long retest interval. The test-retest correlation for the orienting to name subscale was not significant either, possibly due to the fact that the difference in the orienting to name subscale score was not notable, because almost all of the patients were successful in this subscale.",

It was found that the difference in the total SIB score and its subscale scores between the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients was significant, except for the orienting to name subscale. Despite their pervasive deficits, the more severely demented patients belonging to CDR 3 showed a wide variation in both the total SIB scores and the scores on each subscale. These results suggest that the SIB is useful for evaluating dementia patients with a moderate to severe range of functioning, and can differentiate between the poor performances of very severely impaired dementia patients. The SIB can also avoid the floor effect that was frequently observed in conventional neuropsychological tests used for evaluating patients in the advanced stages. In the analysis of the impairment in individual cognitive domains according to dementia severity, the CDR 2 patients had greater impairment in memory and orientation than other cognitive domains. On the other hand, the construction, attention and social interaction abilities were comparatively maintained. The CDR 3 patients showed more severe impairment than the CDR 2 patients in all cognitive functions. In particular, greater impairment was observed in the construction, attention and praxis subscales. However, the difference in the orienting to name subscale score between the CDR 2 and CDR 3 patients was not significant. This result indicates that recognition of self is relatively maintained until the advanced stages of dementia. These aspects of the comparative decline in various cognitive domains are consistent with the clinical course of AD, so the result of this study should provide us with a better understanding of natural history in AD. However, there is a limitation in that this study included not only AD patients but also patients with other forms of dementia. Therefore, it is necessary to compare the different aspects of cognitive impairment by dementia subtype in a further study."

However, the time orientation, attention/calculation and recall subscale scores were at floor and consequently, these subscales were not apt to discriminate dementia severity in the moderate to severe stages of dementia. The S-ADL had a somewhat lower sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy than those of the SIB and K-MMSE. These results indicate that the SIB has greater clinical utility than the K-MMSE and S-ADL, because it can provide comprehensive information about the changes in various types of cognitive functioning (i.e. social functioning, memory, language, and so on) of the patients and can discriminate between the relative impairment in the cognitive domains in the final stages of the disease."
