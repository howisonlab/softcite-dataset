A population pharmacokinetic model for tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) in CF patients was developed to characterize the effect of covariates including body mass index (BMI) and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s as percent of the predicted value (FEV 1 % predicted) at baseline) on the serum exposure parameters. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination and first-order absorption was developed. Across a range of baseline demographic values in the study population, the predicted mean values for the maximum (C max) and trough (C trough) plasma concentrations at steady state were at least 7.5 and 5-fold lower, respectively, than the recommended thresholds for tobramycin toxicity (12 \u00b5g/ml for C max and 2 \u00b5g/ml for C trough). This model adequately described the tobramycin serum concentration-time course in CF patients following inhalation of TIP. The results indicate that no BMI-or FEV 1-based dose adjustment is needed for use of TIP in CF patients.",

            "text": "The major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is progressive deterioration of lung function. 1 By adolescence, the majority of individuals with CF develop an endobronchial infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2 Chronic infection with this pathogen is associated with accelerated progression of obstructive lung disease, increased morbidity, and increased risk of death. 1, [3][4][5] Tobramycin is an effective antibacterial agent used for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection, but it can cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity at high systemic concentrations. 6 The advent of tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS; (TOBI)) provided an effective way of delivering a high concentration of tobramycin to the infected airways while avoiding the toxicity associated with systemic administration. Both US and European treatment guidelines for CF recommend the use of TIS for the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections in patients aged \u22656 years. 7,8 TIS is administered b.i.d. via a nebulizer, a process that takes ~15-20 min per dose, including additional time for nebulizer setup and cleaning. 9 This time burden could be one of the major reasons for poor adherence to treatment in patients with CF, which may lead to poor clinical outcomes. [10][11][12][13] Tobramycin powder for inhalation (TOBI Podhaler or TIP) has been developed to enhance the delivery of tobramycin to the lung and shorten administration time. This may lead to improved patient adherence and a better clinical outcome. Tobramycin inhalation powder (TIP) is manufactured using an emulsion-based spray-drying process that yields spherical hollow porous particles designed to be delivered via the TOBI Podhaler (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, San Carlos, CA), a dry powder inhaler that is light, portable, and requires no power source. 14 Furthermore, drug administration time is reduced to 4-6 min for TIP via the Podhaler, compared with 15-20 min for TIS, improving the convenience for patients. 9,15 Clinical data have shown that 112 mg TIP administered b.i.d. was effective and well tolerated in CF patients with P. aeruginosa infection and were consistent with data reported for the currently approved TIS formulation. 15,16 TIP improved lung function, decreased sputum P. aeruginosa density, reduced respiratory-tract-related hospitalizations, and reduced the use of other antipseudomonal antibiotics. 16 Additionally, it has been demonstrated that the systemic exposure following 112 mg tobramycin delivered via Podhaler is comparable with that from TIS and is well below known systemic toxicity levels. 16 Topical delivery of aerosol to the lung is highly variable among individuals and is known to be affected by patient factors such as age, upper and lower airway anatomy, and inspiratory breathing pattern. 17 The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic model to characterize pharmacokinetic profile for TIP in CF patients, and to characterize the effects of patients' baseline characteristics, including age, body mass index (BMI), creatinine clearance, sex, lung function (as forced expiratory volume in 1 s as percent of the predicted value (FEV 1 % predicted)) and weight, on the model parameters, if any. Only pharmacokinetic data from TIP were used in this population pharmacokinetic model.",

Modeling approaches have been used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of inhalation solutions for use in nebulizers or aerosols (e.g., (R)-albuterol and (S)-albuterol inhalation solutions in pediatric patients with asthma, 19 levofloxacin inhalation solution for patients with CF). 20 Systemic C max and C trough of tobramycin above 12 and 2 \u00b5g/ ml, respectively, are associated with higher risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity in CF patients and should be carefully monitored. 6 A population pharmacokinetic model was therefore developed to describe the tobramycin serum concentration-time course in CF patients following inhalation of TIP, which demonstrates that systemic levels of tobramycin via TIP inhalation are well below the known toxicity levels associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Although the systemic C max of 12 \u00b5g/ml is a general guidance for intravenous tobramycin, the recommended C max for CF patients are similar (8-12 \u00b5g/ml) for t.i.d. tobramycin regimen; no specific recommended C max value is available for q.d. regimen. 21 Therefore, for conservative estimation of toxicity risk, a 12-\u00b5g/ml threshold was used for C max in this study.",

These findings are consistent with the results of previous studies 23,24 or of other inhaled therapies and consistent with the concept that lung dose increases with age but is proportional to body size. Thus, TIP can be dosed at fixed doses (with no dose adjustment necessary) in adults and children above 6 years of age, with an acceptable safety margin due to low systemic exposure. Although tobramycin is known to be eliminated via the renal route and its clearance is dependent on renal function, the current population pharmacokinetic model indicated that creatinine clearance did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tobramycin after TIP administration. This is likely due to the fact that only patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment were included in the study population (minimum creatinine clearance was 63.9 ml/min in the pharmacokinetic population). Similar to TIS, monitoring of serum tobramycin concentration is recommended if TIP is used in patients with renal dysfunction.",

The change in the NONMEM objective function value and goodness-of-fit plots were used to guide the model development. One-and two-compartment disposition models with first-order absorption and first-order elimination were evaluated based on the previous knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the compound from a single-dose study. 9 IIV was assessed on all structural model parameters, as was interoccasion variability (the occasion variable was derived based on the visit number: it was assumed that concentrations measured at different study visits represented distinct occasions). The pharmacokinetic parameters (k a , volumes, and clearances) were assumed to be log-normally distributed around the population mean, but the random effects to describe both IIV and interoccasion variability were assumed to be distributed with a mean of zero. The effects of covariates (age, BMI, creatinine clearance, sex, FEV 1 % predicted at baseline, and weight) on the pharmacokinetic model were investigated once an adequate structural and stochastic model had been finalized. Age was categorized into three groups: 6-11, 12-17, and \u226518 years. Each covariate was tested individually against the key structural model parameters k a , V d /F, and CL/F in a stepwise fashion (forward inclusion). After each step, the strongest covariate relationship was incorporated into the model, and the others sequentially and individually retested, until no further covariates could be added with statistical significance. The inclusion of a covariate term was considered statistically significant if it produced a difference of 3.84 (P = 0.05, given a single degree of freedom) in the NONMEM objective function value during the forward inclusion and if it produced an objective function value difference of 6.64 (P = 0.01, given a single degree of freedom) during the backward elimination. A combination of proportional and additive error models was used. The visual predictive check was used to provide an assessment of the model's ability to describe the data and the model's suitability for simulation. For the covariates identified after the stepwise process, 1,000 simulations were performed to evaluate their effect on the drug exposure at steady state using the following metrics: C max and C trough . The sensitivity of each metric to a given covariate was evaluated by simulation using different percentile values of the covariate distribution in the pharmacokinetic population, while keeping values of the other identified covariates in the model fixed at their median values in the pharmacokinetic population. These simulations were undertaken using the population parameter estimates from the final model and the IIV values of pharmacokinetic parameters, and they yielded the metrics of interest and their 95% predictive intervals. Further details of the modeling methods can be found in the Supplementary appendix.",
