Methods and Results: Unlike monocrotaline or hypoxic/ sugen rats, bleomycin-treated rats presented a non-vasoreactive PH characterized by the absence of pulmonary dilatation to adenosine. We therefore chose the bleomycin rat model to compare the effects of the maximally effective doses of macitentan and bosentan on pulmonary vascular and RV remodeling. Macitentan (100 mg$kg 21 $d 21), but not bosentan (300 mg$kg 21 $d 21), significantly prevented pulmonary vascular remodeling, RV hypertrophy, and cardiomyocyte diameter increase. Cardiac protection by macitentan was associated with a significant attenuation of genes related to cell hypertrophy and extracellular matrix remodeling. Microautoradiography and high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed greater distribution of macitentan than bosentan in the RV and pulmonary tissue. Conclusions: Macitentan was more efficacious than bosentan in preventing the development of pulmonary and RV hypertrophies in a model of non-vasoreactive PH. Greater ability to distribute into the tissue could contribute to the greater structural improvement by macitentan compared with bosentan."

            "text": "Endothelins are vasoactive peptides of which endothelin-1 (ET-1) is the most abundant in the lung. ET-1 responses are mediated via activation of 2 homologous G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, endothelin A receptor (ET A ) and endothelin B receptor (ET B ). Beyond its vasoconstrictive action, ET-1 is involved in deleterious processes affecting vascular and organ remodeling, such as hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation. 1 Organ-selective upregulation of the ET system in cardiovascular diseases, including pulmonary hypertension (PH), 2,3 and its local autocrine/paracrine activity associated with a high tissue receptor density 4,5 suggest that the ET system can act as a key player on long-term disease progression by contributing to target organ remodeling. PH is a progressive disease leading to right ventricular (RV) failure and ultimately death, even on currently available therapy. ET receptor antagonism is an attractive approach to protect cardiac cells from hypertrophy as it provides, beyond direct inhibition of ET signaling, neurohormonal blockade. Indeed, ET receptor antagonists were shown to be sympatholytic and to decrease aldosterone levels in patients with heart failure. 6 The involvement of ET-1 in the pathophysiology of PH has been confirmed by the efficacy of first-generation ET receptor antagonists, which improved symptoms and delayed time to clinical worsening in patients with group 1 PH. 7,8 Recently, in the event-driven SERAPHIN trial, macitentan (10 mg) met its primary endpoint by significantly reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality by 45% in these patients. 9 Macitentan is a novel dual ET A and ET B receptor antagonist with physicochemical properties favoring sustained receptor binding and high tissue distribution. 10,11 It was selected for development based on its oral efficacy in vivo in animal models of systemic and PH. [11][12][13] In the monocrotaline-treated rat model of PH, macitentan dose dependently prevented the development of PH, decreased RV hypertrophy, and increased survival. 11 PH patients who respond acutely to vasodilators (ie, vasoreactive PH) represent a form of disease associated with exaggerated pulmonary vasoconstriction and/or at an early stage of the disease before development of established vascular lesions because of remodeling. These patients are amenable for longterm treatment with calcium channel antagonists, whereas nonresponders (ie, non-vasoreactive PH) are considered for other pharmacological options: phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, ET receptor antagonists, prostacyclin receptor agonists, or guanylyl cyclase activators. 14 In non-vasoreactive PH, vascular remodeling associated with cell proliferation contributes to the maintenance of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leading to RV remodeling and ultimately to a decompensated heart failure. Therefore, to compare the efficacy of macitentan versus another dual ET receptor antagonist, bosentan, on RV remodeling, we searched for a model of non-vasoreactive PH to focus on anti-remodeling effects beyond pulmonary vasodilation. The question whether animal models reflect vasoreactive or nonvasoreactive PH remains unknown. In this study, we first screened several PH rat models for acute response to vasodilators and then compared the disease-modifying efficacy of macitentan and bosentan with particular emphasis on RV remodeling.",

Animals were examined 28 days post-bleomycin instillation under isofluran-induced narcosis (2.5%, inhalation). Measurements, performed by 2 sonographers blinded to the treatment groups, were made in accordance with the conventions of the American Society of Echocardiography. M-mode measurements of RV free wall thickness and end-diastolic cavity dimension (left ventricle: LV and RV areas) were measured in the parasternal short axis view, just below the level of the aortic valve, and their ratio was calculated. Pulsed wave Doppler of pulmonary outflow was recorded in the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valve. The sample volume was placed proximal to the pulmonary valve leaflets and aligned to maximize laminar flow. In addition, the PA acceleration time, velocity time integral, and ejection time (ET) were measured. By combining PA velocity time integral, PA area, and heart rate, echographic cardiac output was determined. The tricuspid valve was also evaluated for the presence of tricuspid regurgitation with color and continuouswave Doppler in the apical 4-chamber view; no alteration was detected. At the time of killing, that is, after echocardiography, a rapid excision of the lungs and heart was performed through a ventral thoracotomy, and each organ was weighed. After removal of the atria to the plane of the atrial-ventricular valves, the RV free wall was dissected from the LV and septum. The RV and LV + septum were weighed, and the RV-to-LV + septum ratio (Fulton index) was calculated. Tibia lengths were measured to normalize read outs because animals presented body weight differences between the groups at the end of study. Eight RVs from each group were then processed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction, whereas the remaining samples were used for histological analysis."

Plasma and organ concentrations of macitentan, its active metabolite ACT-132577, and bosentan were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), as previously described. 11 A similar study using the same doses of drugs was performed in monocrotaline rats (see Supplementary Material S1, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links. lww.com/JCVP/A207, for animal preparation) to confirm the pattern of distribution of macitentan and bosentan in another model of PH.",

Of note, after single oral administration of radiolabeled macitentan, more radioactivity was apparent in the lung substructures, particularly the cuboidal cells and smooth muscle/collagen regions of the bronchioles, when the animals had been pretreated with bleomycin compared with control animals (Fig. 7B). Quantification of drug concentration by LC-MS in the lung at T max + 6 hours confirmed the microautoradiography findings as total lung contents of macitentan and its active major metabolite were approximately 4 times higher than that of bosentan for comparable plasma exposures as reflected by respective plasma concentrations at estimated T max (bosentan: 1625 ng/mL; macitentan + metabolite: 2222 ng/mL). Moreover, the quantification of macitentan and its metabolite in the RV indicated a higher concentration than bosentan (Fig. 7C).

Although moderate when compared with other PH models, the increased mPAP remained elevated over the study period and was accompanied by mild RV hypertrophy with preserved function and pulmonary vascular hypertrophy. Unlike the monocrotaline and sugen/hypoxia rat models of PH, the bleomycin rat presented a non-vasoreactive PH characterized by the absence of an acute vasodilatory response to adenosine infusion and hypertrophic vascular remodeling.",

This observation is confirmed by other studies demonstrating efficacy of bosentan on cardiac remodeling in hypoxic 28 and hypoxia/sugen 29 rats, whereas bosentan had no effect on this read out in our study.

            "text": "We recently presented evidence that macitentan had a greater pharmacological activity versus bosentan in vivo: in bleomycin-treated rats, the maximal efficacious dose of macitentan was able to further decrease mPAP when administered on top of the maximal efficacious dose of bosentan. 13 Together with the findings of the present study, showing a superiority of macitentan over bosentan on RV and pulmonary vessel remodeling, our data suggest that macitentan can achieve a more complete inhibition of the ET system in vivo. In addition to a longer effective half-life because of the presence of an active metabolite, macitentan differs from bosentan by its receptor-binding properties and its ability to distribute into tissues. Macitentan is a competitive antagonist with a prolonged receptor occupancy half-life. Macitentan thus displays insurmountable antagonism, that is, it is capable of efficient receptor blockade irrespective of the ET-1 concentration. 10,30 In diseased tissues, where local ET-1 concentrations are elevated, such a binding mode together with the higher local concentration of the compound might confer superior blockade of downstream signaling induced by ET-1. In addition to the binding kinetics, we also hypothesized that macitentan could have differential tissue distribution compared with bosentan, which we thought could be because of differences in their physiochemical properties (eg, pKa, lipophilicity). 11 Using microautoradiography and tissue quantification by LC-MS, we were able to demonstrate (1) differential tissue distribution of macitentan in normal versus diseased lung and (2) increased lung and RV concentration of macitentan versus bosentan in 2 models of PH, suggesting that these findings are not limited to the bleomycin rat model but could apply to other models of PH. The use of radiolabeled material enabled us to study the distribution of both macitentan and its active metabolite. We previously reported that oral administration of macitentan leads to the formation of metabolite ACT-132577, a dual ET A /ET B antagonist. Although its overall potency on ET receptors is 5-10 times less than that of macitentan, ACT-132577 has a longer half-life than macitentan, accumulates with time, and is expected to contribute to the pharmacological effects observed after oral administration of macitentan. 11,31 The microautoradiography studies revealed increased distribution of macitentan-derived radioactivity in diseased lung tissue compared with healthy lungs. This latter observation, which might not be specific to macitentan and could apply to other ET receptor antagonists, may be because of an increased permeability of the damaged tissue and/or an upregulation of the ET binding sites in bleomycin rats.",

This discrepancy could be explained by 2 factors: first, as we used maximal effective doses of each compound to ensure maximal effect on the remodeling, one cannot rule out that a slight greater effect on mPAP obtained with macitentan (Fig. 2), possibly because of its ability to block more receptors than bosentan, could be responsible for its superior efficacy on RV and pulmonary remodeling compared with bosentan. Second, our results on lung fibrosis suggest that the ET system, although important, is not the sole driver in lung fibrosis and that a plateau effect has been reached with the 2 drugs. Of note, both clinical trials in patients with pulmonary fibrosis involving macitentan and bosentan did not reach their primary efficacy endpoints indicating that targeting the ET system alone may not be sufficient in this indication.",

Although no clinical direct comparison was made, macitentan (10 mg) is currently the only ET receptor antagonist that demonstrated a dosedependent effect on a composite hard endpoint (mortality/morbidity) in a clinical trial and a sustained 50% risk reduction in death or hospitalization because of PH during treatment. 9 In our study, RV protection was associated with a greater attenuation by macitentan of the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix/cardiac remodeling (Col1a1, Lox, Timp1). Expression of genes encoding mediators of fibrosis, such as fibronectin (Fn1) 33 and galectin-3 (Lgal3), 34 was similarly corrected by both drugs. In contrast to bosentan, macitentan significantly decreased Inhba and Fst genes. The Inhba gene encodes activin A, a homodimer of inhibin beta subunit, related to the transforming growth factor b superfamily and involved in cardiac remodeling and inflammation. 35,36 The Fst gene encodes follistatin, a negative regulator of activin that removes activin A from the circulation. 37 Follistatin is upregulated in patients with PH, and its plasma levels are correlated with increased mortality. 38 In our study, increase of follistatin was observed in parallel to activin A activation in bleomycintreated rats, as a possible counterregulatory mechanism. Our data suggest that macitentan can blunt the activin A/follistatin axis to protect against the development of cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, the consistent and more pronounced attenuation of gene expression changes that are associated with heart remodeling could suggest improved local activity of macitentan in comparison with bosentan, also in the heart.",
