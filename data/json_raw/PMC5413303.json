We studied the origins and evolution of an OCT signature called plateau in eyes with GA and suggested a histologic correlate. METHODS. Serial eye-tracked OCT scans and multimodal imaging were acquired from eight eyes of seven patients with GA and plateau signatures over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years (range, 3.7-11.6). The histology of unrelated donor eyes with AMD was reviewed. RESULTS. Drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment (PED) on OCT imaging progressed into wide-based mound-like signatures with flattened apices characterized by a hyporeflective yet heterogeneous interior and an overlying hyperreflective exterior, similar to outer retinal corrugations previously ascribed to persistent basal laminar deposit (BLamD) but larger. These new signatures are described as ''plateaus.'' An initial increase of the PED volume and hyporeflectivity of its contents was followed by a decrease in PED volume and thinning of an overlying hyperreflective band attributable to the loss of the overlying RPE leaving persistent BLamD. Both imaging and histology revealed persistent BLamD with defects through which gliotic M\u00fcller cell processes pass. CONCLUSIONS. Plateaus can be traced back to drusenoid PEDs on OCT imaging. We hypothesize that during progressive RPE atrophy, M\u00fcller cell extension through focal defects in the residual persistent BLamD may contribute to the heterogeneous internal reflectivity of these entities. The role of M\u00fcller cell activation and extension in the pathogenesis of AMD should be explored in future studies.",

            "text": "A dvanced AMD is a significant cause of central vision loss in the elderly population 1,2 and, although treatment options currently exist for neovascular AMD, 3 no evidence-based therapy is yet effective in treating or preventing atrophic AMD, also known as geographic atrophy (GA). 4,5 Advances in multimodal imaging technology, including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), have allowed detailed in vivo study of early AMD features and identification of high-risk features associated with the progression of drusen and drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) into GA. [6][7][8] In addition, the retrospective use of serial eye-tracked OCT imaging allows the study of the origins and evolution of end-stage features seen within GA areas, providing valuable insights into disease pathogenesis. 9 Recently, we described a characteristic growth and collapse of large PEDs in which collapse was preceded by a roughening of the RPE-Bruch's membrane (BrM) band followed by the appearance directly above, within the retina, of hyperreflective foci believed to be RPE. 10 Growth and collapse is common to drusen of all sizes, and presence of hyperreflective foci over drusen can predict progression, so these RPE changes before atrophy may be generalizable. 11,12 OCT imaging has revealed various distinctive signatures, both within the atrophic area and around the GA margin, some of which, including outer retinal tubulation (ORT) 13 and outer retinal corrugation, 14 have been assigned histologic correlates. In particular, outer retinal corrugation could be correlated with persistence of basal laminar deposit (BLamD). BLamD is a stereotypically structured thick layer of basement membrane material with other components that is interposed between the RPE plasma membrane and the original basal lamina. BLamD is hyporeflective when the RPE is present and hyperreflective when the RPE is not present. 14 Other OCT signatures, such ''hyperreflective crown-like structures,'' ''hyperreflective pyramidal structures'' (HPS), and ''ghost drusen,'' [13][14][15][16] do not yet have agreed-on correlates. By seeking histologic correlates, we can fill in gaps in the progression sequence and gain an accurate picture of the timing and spatial characteristics of RPE Copyright 2017 The Authors iovs.arvojournals.org j ISSN: 1552-5783 atrophy over drusen and PEDs. In turn, an accurate and comprehensive timeline can prompt new mechanistic hypotheses of cell death that are experimentally testable in model systems, leading to new therapeutic strategies.",

After studying many such lesions in detail, we observed that most are not triangular but instead are mound-like with a flattened apex and a wide base, resembling a ''plateau'' (Fig. 1). Based on these observations, and to avoid further confusion in terminology, we propose ''plateau'' (plural plateaus or plateaux) as a more accurate descriptor than ''wedge.'' Of note, plateaus should be differentiated from other tomographic signatures seen in eyes with GA such as ORT, refractile drusen, and HPS ( Fig. 1). 15,16,21 We find that plateau natural history can be differentiated from that described for PED collapse, thus providing a basis for considering outer retinal corrugations and plateaus a continuum of OCT signatures involving persistent BLamD.",

These extracted SD-OCT images were then stacked, aligned, and saved as a video file using the Fiji distribution (''Fiji is just Image J,'' http://fiji.sc; in the public domain) 22 for the qualitative analysis of the progression of the lesion (see Supplementary Video). At each time point, the plateau appearance on SD-OCT was correlated to the appearance in CFP, NIR, and FAF.",

AMD eyes were identified through an ex vivo imaging screen of eyes accessioned for research purposes from nondiabetic white donors to the Alabama Eye Bank during the period 1996 to 2012. Median death-to-preservation time was 3:49 hours (range, 0:40-11:40 hours). Thirteen eyes with GA were reviewed for examples suitable for this study. Ophthalmic health records were not available for these donors. Eyes were preserved by immersion in 1% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer following anterior segment excision. After vitreous removal, maculas were photographed in color on a stereomicroscope (SMZ-U; Nikon, Melville, NY, USA). 27 When prepared for histology (2011-2013) and uploaded to the Project MACULA Web site (http://projectmacula.cis.uab.edu, in the public domain), eyes underwent additional multimodal ex vivo imaging. From each globe, an 8-mm-diameter full-thickness tissue punch containing the fovea and temporal portion of the optic nerve head was held in a tissue holder mounted on a Spectralis, as described. 27 A 308 3 208 SD-OCT volume (143 scans, 30-lm spacing, automated real-time averaging [ART] \u00bc 25) was captured along with red-free and near-infrared reflectance scanning laser ophthalmoscopic images. Tissue punches were postfixed by osmium tannic acid paraphenylenediamine to accentuate extracellular lipid and embedded in epoxy resin (PolyBed 812; Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA). 28 Sub-micrometerthick (0.8 lm) sections at 25-to 30-lm intervals were stained with 1% toluidine blue for polychromaticity, scanned with a 340 objective, and reviewed and photodocumented with a 360 oil-immersion objective (numerical aperture \u00bc 1.4) and digital camera (XC10; Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA). Images were adjusted for exposure, contrast, and sharpness (Photoshop CS6, Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).",

A single plateau was seen in all eyes except for one (patient 2) that had two separate plateaus (Fig.  2). Patient 6 had one plateau in each eye. In the seven eyes with a baseline PED, PED volume gradually increased (Fig. 5) due to an increase in the hyporeflective interior. The thinning of the hyperreflective band over the PED surface after RPE loss (at which point we consider the plateau to be formed) was preceded by a sharp decrease in PED volume (Fig. 5). Subsequently, the volume of the residual plateau appeared very stable over time (Fig. 5).",

Atrophy spared the fovea in this eye, as seen with ex vivo CFP and 488nm autofluorescence, and small reflective puncta in the atrophic area were apparent on NIR (Figs. 6A-C). In a panoramic view (Fig. 6E), BLamD was seen as discontinuous, being present at three separate locations. Pigmented cells were of the ''subducted'' phenotype, 29 that is, RPE-originated cells located external to BLamD, in contact with BrM. For reference, in the Henle fiber layer of a normal eye, obliquely oriented M\u00fcller cell processes are parallel to, and interleaved with, inner fibers of cone and rod photoreceptors. 30,31 In the presence of severe photoreceptor degeneration, including ORT in this GA eye, the trajectories of gliotic M\u00fcller cell processes were oriented in many directions, as indicated by arrows in Figure  6E. In one instance, processes seemed to enter an outer retinal corrugation horizontally through an opening in the BLamD and sweep the ''subducted'' cells off BrM (Fig. 6D).",

Plateaus were seen on OCT to contain heterogeneous reflectivity enclosed by a thin overlying hyperreflective surface. A focal defect in the hyperreflective surface, in addition to intraretinal and sub-RPE hyperreflective dots, was observed during the evolution of PED into plateau signatures. OPL subsidence was noted to begin at the surface of the PED and progress toward the edge following the areas of expanding atrophy. There was a gradual increase in volume due to an increase in hyporeflective contents initially, followed by complete loss of the RPE and a sharp decrease in PED volume, at which time the plateau was considered to have formed.",

            "text": "AMD. Understanding the origins and evolution of various OCT findings and correlating these findings to histology enable the in vivo study of microscopic cellular changes occurring in these eyes with progressive GA. [32][33][34] The development of GA has been previously reported to occur in 19% of eyes with drusenoid PEDs and to be associated with specific features such as subsidence of the OPL and inner nuclear layer and the development of a hyporeflective ''wedge-shaped band'' within the Henle fiber layer described by Mon\u00e9s et al. 18,20 Half of our study eyes exhibited this wedge. The appearance of plateaus should be distinguished from other signatures previously described in GA, such as ORT, ghost drusen, hyperreflective crown-like structures, HPS, and refractile drusen (Figs. 1,  2). 15,16,21 Plateau boundaries are difficult to distinguish from the surrounding atrophy using CFP, NIR, RF, and FAF (Figs. 1, 3,  4, 6). Previous studies have reported focal areas of hyperautofluorescence within GA, 17 and in our study these correlated with hyperreflective foci seen on en face OCT (Fig. 4). The presence of many pigmented cells of apparent RPE origin within atrophic areas is now well-documented 35,36 ( Fig. 6), and such cells could give rise to both autofluorescence and OCT hyperreflectivity signals. Plateaus do not contain the highly refractile material as seen on CFP and NIR in eyes with spherules in calcifying drusen. 21 These refractile drusen instead appear to correlate with HPS seen on OCT (Fig. 1), the composition of which is the focus of our ongoing studies. 14 However, both the plateau signatures and HPS (Fig. 1) have a similar overlying thin hyperreflective layer consistent with an overlying BLamD drape, as previously observed in OCT 14 and in histology ( Fig. 26 of Sarks et al., 34 and Fig. 3B of Balaratnasingam et al. 37 ).",

            "text": "Our current data support a previous study that suggested that plateaus occur at a low frequency in eyes with GA (7.5%). 17 The plateau is a signature of a residual structure seen on OCT once the RPE has progressed into complete atrophy. In our study, after plateau formation as defined by loss of the overlying RPE layer exposing the underlying BLamD that then persists, minimal changes in plateau volume were observed on subsequent follow-up, as previously seen. 17 In all eyes of our series, a drusenoid PED was noted to precede the appearance , which appear to be organized in a honeycomb-like pattern on en face OCT (blue arrowhead). On cross-sectional OCT, OCTA, and on OCT surface (an en face OCT slab at the level of the RPE-BL atop the plateau), the plateau interior is bounded by a distinct hyperreflective band that continues as a thick and highly reflective RPE band. This hyperreflective surface shows transient hyporeflective defects (yellow arrows) during the evolution of these lesions. An en face OCT image of the plateau surface allows better appreciation of the focal defects (yellow arrow). OCTA does not show flow within the plateau. (B) A plateau located within the area of GA features internal hyporeflective areas on cross-sectional OCT (blue arrowhead), which appear to be organized in a honeycomb-like pattern on en face OCT (blue arrowhead). On crosssectional OCT and OCTA, a distinct hyperreflective surface surrounds the plateau interior and focal defects (yellow arrows) can be seen in some areas. An en face OCT taken at the plateau surface allows better appreciation of focal defects in this hyperreflective layer (en face OCTA: surface yellow arrow). Deep to these focal defects are hyperreflective features (FAF and en face OCT: green arrowheads) that are also seen on FAF as punctate hyperfluorescence within the confluent area of hypoautofluorescence. OCTA does not show flow within the plateau. of the plateau. In a prior description, plateaus were thought to evolve in the outer retina and the hyperreflective line that is likely persistent BLamD was attributed to the OPL. 17 In contrast, serial eye-tracked OCT imaging in our cases shows that changes occurred in the sub-RPE compartment, defined in atrophic eyes as the space external to persistent BLamD. 38,39 During development of a plateau, its thin hyperreflective surface, having emerged after RPE atrophy, is readily distinguishable from the overlying subsiding OPL (Figs. 1, 2).",

Our detailed description of plateaus will facilitate mechanistic thinking and guide the design of future studies with more patients to investigate associated risk factors that may have prognostic value. Evolution of a plateau entails at least four processes that are discernible at the histologic level and also in SD-OCT. In approximately chronologic order, the sequence of the evolution is as follows: loss of RPE, persistence of BLamD, followed by concurrent clearing of druse contents and occupation of druse space by cellular processes. The loss of RPE is the point at which a drusenoid PED becomes a plateau, and it is marked by a thick, roughened, and highly hyperreflective band becoming thinner, smoother, and moderately hyperreflective. Hyperreflective foci over PED destined for plateaus were noted in our series, suggestive of anterior RPE migration, as also seen over PED destined for collapse. 10 The development of GA is hypothesized to proceed via two main pathways of RPE fate, 29 including migration of fully pigmented and nucleated RPE into the retina (called ''sloughed'' and ''intraretinal'') and shedding of non-nucleated granule aggregates, possibly apoptotic remnants, into underlying BLamD. Our previous studies correlated intraretinal hyperreflective foci seen on in vivo and ex vivo OCT with anteriorly migrating RPE cells. 10,11,35 Thus, we have good reason to suspect that the spherical hyperreflective intraretinal foci directly internal to the plateaus are also migrating RPE cells.",

            "text": "The thin, moderately hyperreflective band draped over plateaus is persistent BLamD that maintains the shape of the original PED. BLamD is a stereotypically structured thick layer of basement membrane material that was initially used by Sarks et al. 34 to stage AMD eyes and has been recently shown to be clinically visible by SD-OCT. 14,40,41 A basement membrane is a defining feature of an epithelium, as is the RPE. BLamD is composed of basement membrane proteins and carbohydrate- bearing moieties. It is crossed by lipoprotein particles en route to BrM and choriocapillaris for apparent egress to the systemic circulation. [42][43][44] BLamD observed on OCT is typically shadowed by the RPE. When BLamD is thick enough to be visible, it is observable as a hyporeflective layer. 14,40,41 After the RPE atrophies and can no longer cast a shadow, BLamD emerges as a moderately hyperreflective line of overall horizontal orientation that is sometimes corrugated. Outer retinal corrugations were proposed to be contraction folds of persistent BLamD created by loss of neovascular tissue or drusen/basal linear deposit previously located in the sub-RPE space. 14 Here we extend this model to large drusenoid PED, on the grounds that corrugations and plateaus represent a continuum of OCT signatures involving persistent BLamD. Further, we propose on the basis of prior pathology literature a possible mechanism for how sub-RPE material may be cleared and the shape of persistent BLamD established. Thus, our observations on a histologic case with an apparent corrugation ( Fig. 6) can be cautiously extrapolated to a plateau, which is larger.",

Another strength is the availability of up to nine separate imaging technologies, each specifically highlighting different tissue features in any one case and the availability of one illustrative histology case. Limitations include the small number of eyes and the absence of direct correlation of in vivo imaging to postmortem histology; hence, although our hypothesis of M\u00fcller cells involvement in plateau formation is credible and testable, 50 whether these cellular activities are directly visible in OCT is currently unknown. Our technique of volume measurement may be subject to variations according to OCT B-scan density between patients, but for our purpose of studying progression on a per-patient basis, this limitation was acceptable. To minimize inconsistencies, all patients in our study had eyetracked scans at each follow-up visit with similar density scan patterns available for analysis.",

It is important for clinicians to be aware of plateaus and to distinguish them from OCT findings related to neovascular AMD, such as vascularized PEDs or signs of exudation, as OCTA imaging of three eyes in our study showed no evidence of neovascular flow within plateaus (Fig. 4). Plateau structures should not be confused with areas of subretinal fluid and treatment is not indicated for this finding. Finally, the distinctive reflectivity of persistent BLamD in outer retinal corrugations, and, now, plateaus, provides strong motivation for renaming the fourth outer retinal hyperreflective band of normal eyes, which is currently called the RPE-BrM complex, 23 to the RPE-BLam-BrM complex (abbreviated as RBB) 26 to accommodate the appearance of PED and persistent BLamD in eyes with AMD.",
