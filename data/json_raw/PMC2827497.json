RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Three months of simultaneous continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring data from nine subjects were retrospectively evaluated. Glucose excursions between 1330 and 1700 h were defined as relating to snacks with insulin or snacks with no insulin administered. Area under the curve \u03fe180 mg/dl (AUC \u03fe180), average \u232c glucose, and rate of change were analyzed and compared within and between groups. RESULTS-A total of 94 snacks without insulin and 101 snacks with insulin were analyzed. Snacks without insulin had significantly higher log (AUC \u03fe180 \u03e9 1) (1.26 vs. 0.44 mg/dl per event; P \u03fd 0.001), \u232c glucose (114 vs. 52 mg/dl; P \u03fd 0.001), and average rate of change (1.3 vs. 1.1 mg/dl per minute; P \u03fd 0.001). CONCLUSIONS-This study shows that afternoon snacks without insulin boluses are common and result in significantly higher glucose excursions than snacks with insulin administration.",

None, however, have examined the effect of missed insulin boluses for snacks. Because youth frequently snack when unsupervised, it is likely that missed insulin boluses are even more common for snacks than for meals. The purpose of this investigation was to use data from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) together to evaluate the glycemic profiles of missed insulin boluses for afternoon snacks.",

All subjects used the Minimed Paradigm REAL Time System (Northridge, CA) for insulin delivery and CGM. Reports were downloaded using Medtronic CareLink software. Afternoon snacks were identified on CGM as glucose excursions beginning between 1330 and 1700 h. A glucose excursion was considered resolved when glucose levels remained steady for \u054615 min. Glucose excursions with incomplete CGM data or CSII suspension \u03fe15 min were discarded. Glucose excursions were identified as a snack with no insulin (SNI) or a snack with insulin (SWI) as described below, and possible snacks not fitting these criteria were excluded from analysis. SNI criteria were as follows: 1) no bolus administered within \u03ee30 min of the beginning of the glucose excursion, 2) increase in glucose level \u054650 mg/dl, 3) average rate of change from baseline to peak of excursion \u05460.8 mg/dl per minute, 4) starting glucose level \u03fe80 mg/dl (to exclude treatment of hypoglycemia), and 5) determined not to be the dinner meal. Carbohydrate contents for snacks are not known for SNI.",

Exploratory analyses revealed positive skew in the outcome variables (AUC \u03fe180, \u232c glucose, and rate of change). Because AUC \u03fe180 was used, this resulted in a zero inflated distribution; thus, a twostage model was used. Generalized estimating equations were used to determine the distribution of events with blood glucose levels \u0545180 versus \u03fe180 (5) between SNI and SWI. Mixed models were applied by regressing log(AUC\u03fe180 \u03e9 1.0), log(\u232c glucose), and log(rate of change) on to SNI/SWI (unbolused or bolused snack) adjusting for age, sex, and repeated measures on subjects. Results are presented as mean or geometric mean and 95% CI. A general linear mixedmodel approach suggested by Cnaan et al. (6)   (Fig. 1). The average glucose excursion for SWI began at 130 \u03ee 51 mg/dl, peaked at 191 \u03ee 55 mg/dl after 53 \u03ee 27 min, and resolved after 98 \u03ee 48 min at 145 \u03ee 49 mg/dl. Both the main effects of time and SNI versus SWI were significant (P \u03fe 0.0001) as well as the second order effects and interactions concluding that the two curves were significantly different (P \u03fd 0.0001). A table of the ratio of covariate effects and confidence intervals is included in the online appendix, which is available at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/ cgi/content/full/dc09-1840/DC1. Glucose excursions from SNI had a mean log (AUC \u03fe180 \u03e9 1) of 1.26 (95% CI 1.06 -1.46) compared with 0.44 mg/dl per event (95% CI 0.31-0.57) for SWI (P \u03fd 0.001). Neither age nor sex had a significant effect on AUC \u03fe180 (P \u03ed 1.0 and P \u03ed 0.50, respectively).",

Because snacking involves smaller amounts of food over a longer period of time when compared with meals, the glycemic profiles are different. Future prospective studies should include many more subjects, as well as data relating to insulin reduction and food intake with exercise, to further characterize these excursions. Overall, missed insulin boluses for snacks contribute to significant hyperglycemia. Diabetes care providers need to stress the importance of bolusing for snacks as well as for meals.",
