Methods: A longitudinal qualitative study into the experiences of people with ataxia and neurologists. Thematic analysis and follow-up interviews were used to determine diagnosis and management issues over time. Results: People with ataxia recruited via two hospital departments and Ataxia UK were interviewed at baseline (n = 38) and 12-month follow-up (n = 31). Eight consultant neurologists were interviewed once. Patient accounts were diverse, but many expressed frustration at having an incurable condition and dissatisfaction with service outcomes. At follow-up, there was variation in their contact and satisfaction with helping agencies. Service issues regarding continuity of care and the primary/ secondary care interface were evident. Neurologists' accounts also varied. One-half reported that there is nothing that can be done, and one-half favoured specialist referral to increase the likelihood of finding an underlying aetiology within budget constraints. Conclusions: Diagnostic uncertainties existing at baseline remained for patients at follow-up interviews, although some had learned to deal with the uncertainties brought by the diagnosis of a largely untreatable condition. Care pathways only seemed to operate in the case of defined conditions, such as Friedreich's Ataxia, the most commonly inherited cause. The findings point to a need to develop the evidence base to inform the relative utility of diagnostic procedures in the context of finite resources for patient care and support.",

In clinical practice, distinctions are commonly made between hereditary and sporadic ataxias. Age at onset is an important tool in the diagnostic algorithm, although this can vary considerably, for example, even between spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) patients of the same genotype. 6 In the majority of cases, there is no available medical treatment for the ataxia, and management focuses on monitoring, treatment of associated symptoms (e.g. spasticity, cardiomyopathy and diabetes) and physical therapies. 1 In the United",

The findings form part of a wider programme of study, which began from a concern with investigating care pathways and resource use issues in a rare and complex condition with limited treatment and management options. The fact that some ataxias are inherited also offered opportunities for considering the value of genetic testing in relation to diagnosis and management. Given the low knowledge base in relation to progressive ataxias, as well as a concern with resource use, we also set out to examine the patient and service experience from a 'micro' perspective. Thus, we adopted a mixed-methods research strategy, the overall aim of which was to triangulate data from different sources in order to learn more about the provision and utilisation of health services by people with progressive ataxia. For clarity, in this article, we report solely qualitative findings from semistructured interviews. An analysis of statistical data related to resource use will be presented elsewhere.",

            "text": "A recent study utilising data posted to Internet discussion fora found that diagnosis in ataxia was widely regarded as an arduous and frustrating process for patients. An idiopathic designation (anecdotally about 30%-40% of all cerebellar ataxias) was regarded by many as a 'non-diagnosis', and there was some evidence that patients in this category had withdrawn from medical contact. However, people with an idiopathic designation were over-represented in the sample. 7 An analysis of patient interviews at baseline found that people generally had more experience of diagnosis than management, although physical therapies and disability aids were the most valued aspects of health service provision. 8 In this article, we focus on the diagnostic process and also incorporate the views of consultant neurologists. More importantly, we include the results of patient follow-up interviews, which allow a more detailed consideration of the subjective effects on patients of diagnostic processes and outcomes over time. Follow-up interviews took place in 2011, 12 months after baseline interviews. The time period for which we gathered data on service use and provision allows for comparison alongside existing benchmarked data on services for people with long-term neurological conditions more generally. 9 ",

Thus, a key concern of the interviews with neurologists was to compare their views on the diagnosis process and the perceived utility of medical management with those of patients. The longitudinal component allowed us to capture patients who were currently involved in ongoing diagnostic investigations and assess their views on how a diagnosis (or the absence of or changes to a diagnostic label) had affected the management of their condition.",

A preliminary analysis on the first 12 patient interviews was undertaken by the first author (G.D.-W.), who also conducted the interviews. Subsequently, the conceptual framework was expanded in discussion with all the authors of this article. Although the original aim was to describe patient experiences relating to investigation and management of their ataxia, it rapidly became evident as the baseline interviews progressed that most people's contact with health services ended when diagnostic investigations were completed, whether or not an underlying aetiology was found. Accordingly, diagnosis became a focus in the interviews and in the analysis. This article focuses especially on the follow-up data as these experiences are likely to better reflect the current situation for users in services, as opposed to their own historical experiences of health services, which in some cases stretched back several decades.

A small number reported having initial symptoms dismissed by general practitioners (GPs) and/or spending some time being investigated and treated in ENT (ear, nose and throat) departments before being referred to a neurologist. In these cases, it had taken some years to achieve a diagnosis of ataxia. In all, five patients had previous diagnoses (vertigo, chronic headache syndrome, suspected sinus infection, scoliosis and cerebral palsy) changed to cerebellar ataxia. Of them, three of those with an idiopathic designation, or who had a family history of ataxia unconfirmed by the available genetic tests, had pursued further diagnostic testing, for example, by attending one of the four national specialist ataxia centres in an attempt to find the definitive cause for their symptoms. One would have liked to attend a specialist centre but was unable to secure the necessary funding arrangements in order to do so. In general terms, it was possible to discern two different approaches to dealing with a diagnosis of progressive ataxia: engaging with biomedicine or withdrawing from the health system and coping alone (results shown elsewhere). 8 The interviews undertaken indicated that the study group was composed of individuals with extremely diverse illness histories in terms of symptoms, onset, disabilities and speed of progression. However, most shared a dissatisfaction with health services and a frustration that their condition was incurable and sometimes of unknown cause. It was also widely reported by patients that the majority of health workers do not know what 'ataxia' is, which was confirmed by one person with ataxia who was a nurse:",

Those with a family history seemed to have most to gain from recent technological advances in genetic testing, but perhaps also the most to 'lose' when the promise of biomedicine failed to yield the kinds of certainty expected via the diagnosis process.

But patients, 'ataxia' is not a word that they use, so 'ataxia' for many patients is as good a diagnosis as MS or epilepsy or, you know that's the name of the disease 'ataxia'.

Of the six non-specialist neurologists, one-half were explicit that they would refer the patients to an ataxia specialist, in order to increase the likelihood of a 'definitive' diagnosis and to enable more effective targeting of finite NHS resources. One of the ataxia specialists reported that on occasion diagnosis was achieved as if by accident, when a result surprisingly came back positive. Two of the non-specialists suggested that extensive testing in ataxia was wasteful of resources and questionable on clinical grounds, especially when the outcome was seen as having little impact on illness management.

As at baseline, a disproportionate amount of discussion focused on problems negotiating or getting service inputs, with a specific issue around neurological follow-up appointments for people with idiopathic ataxia. Table 1 also reveals a consumerist approach to service provision, with people 'pushing' for provision. One interviewee's carer specifically recommended that people with a diagnosis of a progressive disabling condition like ataxia should be given an 'A4 signpost of helping agencies' (P19: 20). When considering specific positive and negative comments about services (Table 2), it appeared that physiotherapy input was generally viewed favourably and most negative comments were directed towards interaction with mainstream health-care workers or doctors seen for other health problems, including GPs. It should be stressed that in some cases, involvement in the study seemed to have spurred patients into seeking out services and care more proactively. It was noteworthy that most of those who gave more favourable accounts of neurological services had an FA diagnosis, perhaps because there is screening for, and management of, the associated non-neurological complications of the condition.",

Rather than increasing certainty in relation to disease label and prognosis, the diagnostic process had in some cases magnified these uncertainties. However, in one case, an interviewee suggested that patients accepted their condition more following a period of extensive diagnostic testing (P30: 12 and Table 1). By extension, it can be argued that recognising that answers to questions may never be found is one of the things that patients have to adapt to in response to a diagnosis of progressive ataxia. Comments from another interviewee at follow-up in this regard (P31: 9 and Table 2) would suggest that patients might benefit from being informed at the outset that diagnosis may take a long time and that answers might never be found. This may be equally applicable to other neurodegenerative conditions of course. However, in the case of ataxia, the health service and illness experience seem to be fundamentally distinguishable according to whether a definitive -as opposed to a 'black box' -diagnosis is achieved, with negative accounts associated with people with idiopathic diagnoses. Fundamentally, many in this group describe being, or feeling, 'lost' to services, and the potential importance of diagnosis as the key to access therapies and clinical follow-up is underlined.",

However, in management terms, there appeared problems in this regard as their care was often undertaken by GPs who are generally seen as lacking knowledge in relation to progressive ataxias. Thus, in broad terms, a key issue for people with ataxia in their encounters with health professionals related to the individual expertise of each health worker encountered. Perceived lack of knowledge about ataxia caused trouble for people with the condition in their encounters with health professionals about other matters and in settings other than clinical neurology or primary care.

Of the 38 patients interviewed for this study, only 3 (8%) perceived anything positive in achieving a medical diagnosis of 'ataxia' for their symptoms, although some patients were coping better with their diagnostic status when seen at follow-up. The findings suggest that the diagnosis of 'ataxia' represents the first step in identifying an underlying cause, which can give more certainty. This was achieved for some patients by the time of the follow-up interview, where, for example, the disease category was defined as being multisystem atrophy in two cases. One interviewee had undergone genetic testing, which identified a specific type of SCA, but declined to know details and implications of the final result.

The length of time it took some patients in this study for their condition to be labelled as 'ataxia' points to a need for greater awareness of ataxic symptoms in primary care in order to reduce the length of the diagnostic journey for patients. Despite differences of opinion, one issue that seemed to unite neurologists was the importance of excluding treatable forms of ataxia. However, given that treatable forms are rare (within a group of conditions that are rare as a whole), it is perhaps understandable that neurologists would not explicitly impart the details of these investigations in order to avoid a possibly false hope that a treatment might be found. While the approach taken by neurologists reflects their wide experience that extensive tests will be returned with 'normal' or 'negative' results, the confusion and uncertainty demonstrated in some patient accounts suggest a need for a more structured approach to diagnosis and subsequent referral, such that patients -perhaps especially those with an idiopathic designation -do not get 'lost in the system' following diagnostic investigation. Our results also point to a need for an evidence base to support the clinical utility of current diagnostic processes, including the role of genetic tests. Complex conditions such as ataxia can affect a range of physical functions, which often means that care needs to be coordinated between different health professionals. From the patient's viewpoint, it is helpful if someone is overseeing their care and that provision of different service is 'joined up'. In ataxia centres, specialist ataxia nurses are able to provide the kinds of general information and support (e.g. how to access mobility aids or social care benefits) needed by patients in addition to medical care and expertise. However, given that such a service would be valued by those with other neurological conditions, a challenge for services is how to provide such generic advice within a specialist model of care.",

This was reflected in study participants with a diagnosis of FA seemingly reporting greater satisfaction with neurology services than other groups of ataxia patients. FA is the most commonly inherited form of ataxia found in the United Kingdom and has specific clinical features including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiomyopathy, which can be monitored and managed by other specialist medical services. 1 In this respect, there is a better defined clinical pathway for FA than for SCAs and idiopathic ataxia. This could explain why those with an idiopathic ataxia seemed more negative about neurology services (Table 2) and less satisfied with issues relating to clinical management and follow-up. The fact that people with a specific diagnosis report a better experience of neurological services highlights the importance of a diagnosis. However, given an ageing population, the number of people with idiopathic late onset ataxias is likely to increase. In the context of budget constraints and finite resources, the clinical need for an aetiological diagnosis may need to be weighed against the costs of meeting the needs of Attended specialist ataxia clinic but felt it was 'a bit of a waste of time' (P37: idiopathic diagnosis) 'I understand better that it takes time to diagnose this thing and then once they've put the label on it \u2026 just try and take the edge off some of the symptoms.

            "text": "Through the unusual case of a woman in her 70s who had lifelong symptoms of 'vertigo' changed to ataxia as a result of investigations for ataxic symptoms in her son, the circumstances under which a diagnosis of ataxia can lead to a form of 'symptom amplification' 11 were revealed. However, the mechanisms of symptom amplification are by no means clear from this isolated case but point to a fruitful area for further research. In the case of ataxia, however, the fact that there are putative treatments for vertigo, whereas there are none for ataxia may form the kernel of the matter. What remains unclear on the basis of our findings is whether people are better or worse off following a diagnostic process in the context of ataxic symptoms. Historically, attention has not been paid to the potential utility of diagnostic processes in the context of conditions for which there are no clear management outcomes. However, in the context of the financial limits of health-care budgets, these issues are receiving increasing attention. As well as highlighting factors that present potentially negative consequences for patients as a result of diagnostic processes, our findings underline the need for better integration of diagnostic algorithms and procedures with subsequent care and support for people with ataxia. Finally, the setting for this study was an English health region, and it would be fruitful for others to compare our findings with those in other countries, settings and health systems in order to ascertain the best way of providing services to people living with the challenges of progressive ataxia.",

Two were specialists in ataxia diagnosis (i.e. they had a larger ataxia patient case load than the 'one or two' patients encountered by most), while the remainder specialised in other fields of neurology (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS) and movement disorders).

Neurologists regularly complained that most test results come back as 'normal' or 'negative' when investigating ataxia. In relation to this 'negative yield' of diagnostic tests, some consultants also discussed the financial resource implications of order- ing a large number of tests that would be unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis or affect the medical management of the condition. The typical diagnostic pathway is character- ised in the following extract: It is a presentation which often leads to a circuitous diagnostic process with increasing desperation regarding tests and you're often left with an uncertain scenario \u2026 where diagnosis will come to light later on down the line as new symptoms perhaps develop. Sometimes, you know, in a significant proportion of patients, you do all the tests you can do for treatable and [other] conditions \u2026 and you're left with a blank concluding some sort of idiopathic or presumed genetic condition for which you haven't been able to identify at the moment. So that often puts them in a sort of situation where they've got this ongoing diagnostic doubt which, you know, some patients and clinicians find difficult to cope with. (Consultant P6: 1: 136-146)",
