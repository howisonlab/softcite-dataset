            "text": "A clinical requirement exists for early biomarkers that can predict the severity of acute pancreatitis (AP). In order to determine whether E-cadherin is associated with the severity of AP, a pancreatitic rat model was established and the expression levels of E-cadherin were detected. A study population of 24 Sprague Dawley rats was administered intraperitoneal injections of various concentrations of L-arginine in order to induce pancreatitis. Rats were assigned to the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) or mild acute pancreatitis (MAP) group based on the results of histological evaluations and the serum levels of amylase. An additional 8 rats received intraperitoneal injections of NaCl solution, as a control group. For each group, the serum concentrations of soluble E-cadherin and the expression levels of E-cadherin protein in the pancreatic tissue were detected. The results indicated that the rat model of pancreatitis was successfully established. Rats in the high concentration L-arginine treatment group, which exhibited a higher pancreatitis pathology score and level of serum amylase, were assigned to the SAP group. Low concentration L-arginine group rats were assigned to the MAP group. The pathology scores and levels of serum amylase in the SAP and MAP group rats were higher compared with the control group rats. The levels of serum E-cadherin were the most elevated in the SAP group. Statistically significant differences were detected in the SAP and MAP groups compared with the control group, and in the SAP group compared with the MAP group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the levels of E-cadherin protein in the pancreatic tissue were elevated in the SAP group compared with the MAP and control groups. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that E-cadherin was overex-pressed in SAP rats, and the overexpression of E-cadherin may be associated with the severity of AP.",

            "text": "Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe inflammatory disease that accounts for >220,000 hospital admissions in the United States each year (1). Although there has been recent progress in the diagnosis and treatment of AP, the incidence of AP has not decreased and its serious systemic complications are a worldwide health issue (2). In certain cases, severe AP (SAP) may lead to multiple organ failure, and thus the mortality rate among patients with SAP may approach 30% (3). Therefore, it is crucial to identify effective early diagnostic markers for AP, and particularly for SAP. The level of serum amylase is a commonly-used clinical indicator for the severity of AP; however, this level not particularly sensitive and it is often difficult to obtain a pancreatic specimen from patients with AP for pathological analysis (4,5). E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that has been linked to cancer development and inflammatory disorders (6,7). During the inflammatory process, cell-cell contacts tend to dissolve, which permits the unregulated movement of fluids and electrolytes into the interstitial space, resulting in tissue edema (8). Once AP has been initiated, the appearance of inflammatory infiltration and interstitial edema are common features (9). Therefore, it is hypothesized that the expression levels of E-cadherin fluctuate during the progression of AP. The aim of the present study was to establish an animal model of pancreatitis and evaluate the levels of soluble E-cadherin, in order to assess its efficacy as a marker of AP severity.",

Animal experiments were authorized according to the Guidance Suggestions for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Wuxi Second Hospital (Wuxi, China). Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were supplied by the Sino-British SIPPR/BK Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., (Shanghai, China). Animal experiments were conducted as described in previous studies (10,11) at Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Wuxi No. 2 People's Hospital between June 2013 and July 2014. In brief, 24 healthy adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 170\u00b115.5 g, were randomly assigned into two treatment groups (n=12 per group). In the high concentration L-arginine (HCLa) group, each SD rat received two intraperitoneal injections of 20% L-arginine (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China; 2.5 g/kg body weight), at an interval of 1 h. In the low concentration L-arginine (LCLa) group, each SD rat received two intraperitoneal injections of 6% L-arginine (2.5 g/kg body weight), at an interval of 1 h. At 24 h after the induction of pancreatitis using L-arginine, all SD rats were sacrificed under ether anesthesia. The pancreas of each rat was then rapidly removed, and separated from the surrounding lymph nodes and fat. Each pancreatic tissue sample was divided into two parts: One part was fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde for histological evaluation and the second part was reserved for protein extraction. The severity of the pancreatitis was determined based on the histological scoring, including the degrees of edema, inflammation, vacuolization and necrosis, and by measurement of serum amylase levels. Furthermore, 8 additional rats received intraperitoneal injections of an equal quantity of 0.9% NaCl solution, and were designated as the control group.",

The tissue sections were graded as described previously (12). A total of 10 high-power fields (HPF) of each section were selected at random and were visualized under a CX31 microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA). Samples were scored on a scale of 0-4, according to the degree of edema, necrosis, vacuolization and inflammation. The degree of edema was scored as follows: 0, No edema; 1, diffuse expansion of interlobar septa; 2, severe diffuse expansion of interlobar septa; 3, diffuse expansion of interacinar septa; and 4, diffuse expansion of intercellular septa. The degree of inflammation was scored as follows: 0, No inflammation; 1, inflammation around ductal margin; 2, inflammation in parenchyma (<50% of lobules); 3, inflammation in parenchyma (50-75% of lobules); and 4, inflammation in parenchyma (>75% of lobules). The degree of vacuolization was scored as follows: 0, No vacuolization; 1, peroductal vacuolization (<5%); 2, focal vacuolization (5-20%); 3, diffused vacuolization (21-50%); and 4, severe vacuolization (>50%). The degree of necrosis was scored as follows: 0, No necrosis; 1, 1-4 necrotic cells/HPF; 2, 5-10 necrotic cells/HPF; 3, 11-15 necrotic cells/HPF; and 4, >16 necrotic cells/HPF.

To the best of our knowledge, the role of E-cadherin in pancreatitis remains controversial. In 2009, Sewpaul et al observed that the mean concentration of soluble E-cadherin in patients with SAP at <12 h was significantly higher compared with that in healthy volunteers and patients with other gastrointestinal pathologies (17). However, Pezzilli et al reported that the serum levels of E-cadherin were not associated with the severity of AP (18).",

It is possible that E-cadherin-associated apoptosis may serve a crucial function in the pathogenesis of SAP. Takeyama reported that apoptosis was involved in the mechanism of infectious complications, in addition to organ dysfunction, in SAP (19). It is known that apoptosis is regulated by numerous genes, and E-cadherin is one among a variety factors that may influence the apoptotic process (20). During apoptosis, E-cadherin is efficiently cleaved in epithelial cells, and fragments with apparent molecular masses of 24, 29 and 84 kDa are generated following the induction of apoptosis by staurosporine or camptothecin (21).",

In the present rat experiments, hemorrhage of the pancreas and bloody ascites were observed in the SAP group rats. The process of extravasation into the parenchyma involves a number of molecular interactions between blood cells and endothelial cells, including tight adhesions, rolling and diapedesis (22). Vonlaufen et al reported that, in cerulein-induced AP, the junctional adhesion molecule C is upregulated (23). In addition, Mayerle et al demonstrated that a variant that was 15 kDa smaller than E-cadherin, which was detected in the early stage of pancreatitis, was the product of E-cadherin cleavage at amino acid 394 in the extracellular domain; this phenomenon was consistent with E-cadherin cleavage by leukocyte-produced elastase (8). Therefore, previous results suggested that polymorphonuclear leukocyte-released elastase may be involved in the dissociation of cell-cell contacts, the extracellular cleavage of E-cadherin and, ultimately, the transmigration of leukocytes into the epithelial tissue during the initial phase of experimental pancreatitis (8).",
