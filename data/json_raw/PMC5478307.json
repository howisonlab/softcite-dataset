This poorly understood variance raises the possibility of genetic modifier effects, particularly in MYBPC3-associated HCM. In a large consanguineous Chinese HCM family, we identified 8 members harboring the MYBPC3 c.3624delC (p.Lys1209Serfs) disease-causing mutation, but with very disparate phenotypes. Genotyping ruled out the modifying effect of previously described variants in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Afterwards, we screened for modifying variants in all known causing genes and closely related genes for cardiomyopathy and channelopathy by performing targeted next-generation sequencing. For first time, we showed that a c.1598C>T (p.Ser533Leu) mutation in voltage-dependent l-type calcium channel subunit beta-2 (CACNB2) was present in all severely affected HCM patients, but not in those moderately affected or genotype-positive phenotype-negative patients. This CACNB2 p.Ser533Leu mutation is extremely conserved in evolution, and was not found in 550 healthy controls. Our results suggest that CACNB2 is a possible candidate genetic modifier of MYBPC3-associated familial HCM, but more genetic evidence and functional experiments are needed to confirm.

            "text": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disease, present in 1 in 500 of the general population. More than 1500 mutations in \u226511 causative genes have been identified in HCM, most of which are unique to individual families. [1] It is estimated that about 70% of patients who are positive for genetic tests carry mutations in b-myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3) genes; these 2 genes account for up to 50% of all clinically diagnosed cases of HCM, whereas other genes account for <10% of cases. [2] Clinically, HCM is a highly heterogeneous disease with not only considerable interfamilial, but also intrafamilial variability in disease phenotypes, which include disease severity, age of onset, and disease progression. [1,3] The extensive phenotypic variability cannot be fully explained by the causal mutations because even siblings sharing the same pathological mutation still show huge discordant phenotypes. This unexplained variance raises the possibility of contribution from other genetic factors, the so-called modifier genes.",

Pharmacologic interventions of the modifier genes involved in HCM-specific pathways might provide new therapeutic opportunities. However, identification of such modifier genes remains challenging and systemic exploration is absent in HCM. Among these few modifiers investigated in HCM, the most studied was genetic variations in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) genes. It was first proposed in a HCM family with a causal MYBPC3 mutation that patients with the pro-left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) genotypes in RAAS genes manifested cardiac hypertrophy, whereas those without pro-LVH genotypes did not. [4] However, this observation was not confirmed in a recent study involving a large population of 368 sporadic HCM patients who carried founder mutations in MYBPC3 gene, [5] indicating that there are other currently unknown modifiers to be discovered.",

However, V-8 needs follow-up reevaluation because he was only 18 at his last clinical evaluation. This remarkable phenotypic variation indicates that disease modifiers exist. We first genotyped the five variations in RAAS genes and revealed no correlation between HCM phenotypes and these genotypes, which ruled out the modifying effect of these RAAS variants. We then performed targeted NGS for the index HCM patient using a panel covering all known causing genes and closely related genes of cardiomyopathy and channelopathy, and the RAAS genes. The NGS captured 99.5% of the target region. A mean coverage of 307\u00c2 was reached and 92.7% of target regions were covered to a depth of at least 20 \u00c2. In total, we identified 301 genetic variants in the index patient across the target region. After excluding synonymous genetic variants, 135 exonic or splice-site variants remained. Further excluding common variants (\u22651.0%) reported in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes, and exomes generated in house left us with 5 candidate variants ( Table 2). Two of these, c.3624delC (p.Lys1209Serfs) within MYBPC3 and c.1598C>T (p.Ser533Leu) within voltage-dependent l-type calcium channel subunit beta-2 (CACNB2; 10p12.31), were predicted to be \"damaging\" by all algorithms, whereas the other 3 mutations, c.1058C>T (p.Ala353Val) within transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1; 19q13.2), c.8134G>T (p.Ala2712Ser) within A-kinase anchoring protein 9 (AKAP9, 7q21.2), and c.3923G>A (p.Arg1308Gln) within desmoplakin (DSP; 6p24.3), were predicted \"benign\" according to at least 2 functional annotation algorithms.",

However, segregation analysis of the other 3 mutations in the family confirmed no association between these mutations and the phenotypes ( Table 3). The good segregation of HCM phenotype with CACNB2 genotype suggests that CACNB2 might serve as a functional modifier in MYBPC3-related HCM. To support this, the affected amino acid of this mutation in CACNB2 is extremely conserved in the evolution (Fig. 4).",

[19] Onset of cardiac symptoms did not occur until the sixth decade of life in this family, and all HCM patients lived to their 90s without the protection of ICDs. Consistently, other MYBPC3 mutations were also reported relatively mild in prognosis and were even considered as founder mutations in several general populations. [21] Our study confirmed that remarkable incomplete penetrance exists in MYBPC3-mutation-carrying HCM patients: 3 family members did not have echocardiographic manifestations of HCM at ages 18, 43, and 45 years. However, 4 other HCM patients carrying the identical mutation showed earlier disease onset (3 at their 40s and 1 at 20s), severe echocardiographic manifestations (greater MWT), and much worse prognosis (1 suffered sudden cardiac death at 20s and 1 at 40 s) than the 3 genotype-positive phenotype-negative patients and most HCM patients reported in previously published literatures. These discrepancies indicate that a modifier gene may contribute to deteriorate disease phenotype in addition to the MYBPC3 mutation.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that other disease modifiers exist beyond the specific disease-causing genetic mutations. HCM is a disease with complex pathogenesis, among which the most well-known were cycling deficiency and sarcomeric structure impairment. [6] Adrenergic system are also involved in the process of LVH or heart failure, [22][23] and reports showed possible modifying effect of variations in their related genes. [4][5] In our study, however, we did not found associations between these variations in adrenergic system and HCM phenotypes. Accumulating evidences support that HCM patients carrying >1 sarcomere gene mutation were associated with more remarkable phenotypes and more adverse outcomes than those with a single mutation. [19,24] However, this is not the case in our study because we did not find patients carrying multiple sarcomere mutations. Instead, for the first time, we showed that CACNB2 is a possible genetic modifier of MYBPC3-associated familial HCM. Our findings were supported by a recently published study, in which Lopes et al [25] used targeted highthroughput sequencing to investigate the genotype-phenotype associations in HCM, and demonstrated that in patients harboring sarcomere protein gene mutations, those who also carried Ankyrin-B gene (ANK2) variants had greater maximum wall thickness. It is notable that mutations in both ANK2 and CACNB2 could lead to channelopathies. [26] In this regard, it is reasonable to postulate that variants in non-sarcomere genes, particularly in candidate genes for channelopathies, are potential genetic modifiers of MYBPC3-related HCM. Genotypes were shown for each individual with a plus (+) indicating mutant and a minus (\u00c0) indicating wild type for that genotype. AKAP = A-kinase anchoring protein 9, CACNB2 = calcium channel subunit beta-2, DSP = desmoplakin, HCM = hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, MYBPC = myosin-binding protein C, TGFB1 = transforming growth factor beta 1.  The proposed concept that channelopathy gene mutations may contribute to HCM phenotype was further advanced by a study screening for mutations in 7 Ca 2+ regulatory genes (i.e., SRI, FKBP1B, CASQ2, PLN, SLN, CALR3, and CALM) in a cohort of 252 unrelated familial HCM patients. [27] Four variants with pathogenic significance were detected in these Ca 2+ regulatory genes, among which 2 patients also carried the MYBPC3 sarcomere mutations. [27] The modifying effect of these variants was not fully illustrated because the family pedigrees were small and screening for other relatives was unavailable. In light of our observations and the data reviewed above, it is likely that most of the evidences concerning modifier genes in HCM are obtained on the basis of MYBPC3 mutations. This may be because of the \"benign\" nature of most MYBPC3 mutations, [3] as MYBPC3 mutations are usually associated with a mild hypertrophy, late-onset, incomplete penetrance, and a better prognosis. Besides, MYBPC3 gene is the only gene reported in HCM with founder mutations, for example, 2% to 8% of all major Indian populations carry a MYBPC3 deletion, and 0.4% of Iceland population carries a MYPPC3 missense mutation. [21] It would be of great interest to investigate genetic modifiers in these populations with founder mutations. [21] 4.4. Possible mechanisms of the CACNB2 mutation modifying disease phenotype CACNB2 encodes for an auxiliary voltage-dependent L-type calcium-channel (LTCC) Ca v b2 subunit and is predominantly expressed in the heart. The Ca v b2 subunit improves the calcium current by promoting the voltage-dependent opening of Ca 2+ channel and enhancing channel surface expression, probably through direct interaction with actin. Mice lacking Ca v b2 have functionally compromised heart and die at embryonic day 10.5. [28] Diminished L-type Ca 2+ currents were observed in these Ca v b2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, as well as in patients with Brugada syndrome harboring loss-of-function mutations in CACNB2. [28] Based on algorithmic prediction, it is likely that the CACNB2 mutation identified in our study could attenuate L-type calcium current in cardiomyocytes, and then inhibits the activation of calcium/ calmodulin (Ca 2+ /CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a key regulator of cardiac physiology and pathology. [29] Subsequently, on the one hand, CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C, which is critical in maintaining sarcomeric structure and function, is markedly decreased. Dephosphorylated cMyBP-C is prone to degradation, [30] and thus leads to dramatic insufficiency of cMyBP-C. This situation is worsened given that the MYBPC3 truncation mutation itself causes haploinsufficiency. It is very likely that the serious cMyBP-C deficiency significantly exacerbates the development of HCM in those severely affected patients because a lack of functional full-length cMyBP-C has been demonstrated to cause HCM phenotypes. [31] On the other hand, CaMKII directly binds to the C terminus of Ca v b2 subunit and facilitates LTCC calcium currents through phosphorylation of Ca v b2. In CACNB2 mutation carriers, this process is inhibited and Ca 2+ currents are further reduced. Considerable Ca 2+ is stored in the sarcomere, but mutant sarcomeres may trap more Ca 2+ than normal sarcomeres, causing a reduction in cytoplasmic Ca 2+ . [32] Therefore, Ca 2+ current dysfunction is extremely evident in those severely affected HCM patients who carry both the MYBPC3 and CACNB2 mutations, which could explain the high rate of sudden cardiac death of these patients.",

However, our sequencing panel included all known causing genes and closely related genes of cardiomyopathy and channelopathy, which very likely cover the modifier gene if it exists. Second, the mechanism of how MYBPC3 interacts with CACNB2 remains undetermined in our study; we were unable to obtain the left ventricular tissue of HCM patients for functional analyses because consent of myocardial biopsy was not provided and none of these patients received heart transplantation or postmortem examination. More genetic evidence and functional experiments are needed to confirm our observations."

We provided a new possible mechanism of HCM pathogenesis, that is, a combination effect of sarcomere gene and channelopathy gene mutations, which however needs confirmation with more genetic evidence and functional experiments."
