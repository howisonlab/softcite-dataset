[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 1,263 patients receiving outpatient care at 13 general hospitals located in Seoul and Gyeonggido who were subjected to examinations in the areas of blood glucose management, complications management, and diabetes education between March 19 and May 29, 2013. The relations between exercise and various regulatory factors including patient's general and clinical characteristics, metabolic regulation, achievement of goals for metabolic regulation, and complication incidence in patients with type 2 diabetes were investigated. [Results] Exercise management was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein Regarding achievement of goals for metabolic regulation, significant odds ratios were observed for the effect of exercise treatment on blood pressure, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, HDL in men, and BMI in patients with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, exercise management was associated with decreased occurrence of cerebrovasculopathy. [Conclusion] In conclusion, exercise induced metabolic regulation of glycemic control, the lipid profile, and body composition, as well as vascular health and complications, in Korean patients with type 2 diabetes.",

We also investigated behavioral treatment, oral hypoglycemic agents, insulin, insulin with an oral hypoglycemic agent and insulin pumps in the case of diabetes treatment. For comorbid medication, we investigated hypertension drugs, anticoagulation agents and anti-lipidemic agents. We investigated the 1 year results, and if there were no records or the records were one or more years old, the patient was considered to have had no check-up. For the appropriate metabolic control level, we checked the blood sugar level, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 100 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein, and serum lipid level. We followed the target standards of the ADA which were the HbA1c < 7.0%, blood pressure < 130/80 mmHg, cholesterol (HDL-C) > 40 mg/dL (male) or 55 mg/ dL (female), and triglyceride < 150 mg/dL 8) .

Diabetes affects both body mass and muscle quality, due to poor vascular supply and peripheral neuropathy 13) . Among the characteristics of the study population, there was a significant difference in only BMI between the exercise and non-exercise groups in the present results. The BMI value represents a highly important risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and exercise adjusts the BMI by reducing visceral fat and increasing the fat-free mass 7,14) Our results showed an association between metabolic regulation variables and exercise management. Most metabolic regulation variables had associations with exercise. Exercise management was associated with a decrease in SBP, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL. Umpierre et al. demonstrated that aerobic exercise intervention improved HbA1c by 0.73% 15) . Furthermore, it is well known that aerobic exercise enhances glycemic control, raising it to a moderate level 5) . Endurance exercise helps to decrease LDL-C, however, it had no impact on HDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides 16) .",

These results are related to the effect of exercise through the regulation of energy metabolism in type 2 diabetes. Exercise induces a change in fuel usage by working muscle from nonesterified fatty acids to a blend of nonesterified fatty acids, glucose, and muscle glycogen 10) . During exercise, the neuroendocrine system would control fuel mobilization 12) . These changes induce a decrease in insulin secretion and increase in glucagon, catecholamine, and cortisol secretion. Moreover, these neural and endocrine changes cause deficits in fuel availability, neural activity from the acting limb, visceral organs, and baroreceptor control of heart rate 17) . The exercise-induced increase in glucagon evokes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis as well as hepatic amino metabolism and fat oxidation. The decrease in insulin is essential to the full glycogenolytic response during exercise. The exercise-induced increase in endogenous glucose production is important in regulation of whole-body glucose homeostasis 10) .",
