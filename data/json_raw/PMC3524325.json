            "text": "Background: Extubation is associated with the risk of complications such as accumulated secretion above the endotracheal tube cuff, eventual atelectasia following a reduction in pulmonary volumes because of a lack of physiological positive end expiratory pressure, and intra-tracheal suction. In order to reduce these complications, and, based on basic physiological principles, a new practical extubation method is presented in this article. Methods: The study was designed as a six-month prospective cross-sectional clinical trial. Two hundred fifty-seven patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were divided into two groups based on their scheduled surgery time. The first group underwent the conventional extubation method, while the other group was extubated according to a new described method. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis results before and after extubation were compared between the two groups to find the effect of the extubation method on the ABG parameters and the oxygenation profile. Results: In all time intervals, the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 / FiO 2) ratio in the new method group patients was improved compared to that in the conventional method; some differences, like PaO 2 / FiO 2 four hours after extubation, were statistically significant, however (p value = 0.0063). Conclusion: The new extubation method improved some respiratory parameters and thus attenuated oxygenation complications and amplified oxygenation after extubation.",

            "text": "For all the painstaking attention granted to tracheal intubation, especially with regard to the management of the difficult airway, precious little heed has thus far been paid to tracheal extubation. 1 Compared to 4.6% respiratory complications in the intubation of elective cases, extubationrelated complications arise in 12% in the same group. 2 In some studies, researchers have tried to, along with other extubation criteria, indicate the application of oxy-hemoglobin as a guide to extubation decision. 3,4 During the extubation process, vital signs and oxyhemoglobin saturation percentage should be monitored. 2,5 Given that the period immediately after extubation is the most critical and vulnerable time for the patient, it is necessary for the medical staff to be alert and look for any sign or symptom of respiratory disturbance and hypoxia. 5 The pulmonary effects of systemic inflammatory reaction after cardiac surgery are often modest and include decreased lung compliance, pulmonary edema, increased intrapulmonary shunt fraction, and decreased functional residual capacity and their resultant hypoxemia. Few patients (2%) undergoing cardiac surgery develop full-blown acute respiratory distress syndrome. 6 However, it is reported that up to 40% of cardiac surgery patients are readmitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of respiratory failure. 7,8 During the last decade, many researchers have tried to address different strategies like the Open Lung Concept (OLC), 9,10 Recruitment Maneuver, 11 and Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) 12,13 as well as some other measures 14,15 in order to attenuate hypoxemia after cardiac surgery.",

The patients were, accordingly, assigned into two groups according to the usage of the nasal cannulae or reservoir mask: 9 (5.9%) patients in the control group and none of the patients in the case group required reservoir masks.

Although we found no comprehensive report of a similar method to compare our results with, our new method and its goals, mechanically, bears considerable similarities with the open lung concept (OLC) recruitment maneuver and use of PEEP and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during and after surgery. The application of the OLC results in fewer episodes of hypoxemia, 9,10 and the use of PEEP as well as that of CPAP prevents the formation of atelectasis. 12,13,17 In all the above-mentioned methods, preventing atelectasis and its unavoidable profound and catastrophic consequences in highly inflame lung parenchyma after on-pump CABG are the main target. Our study would be deemed a new aspect of the OLC, which has been previously ignored. In comparison with the existing literature on the OLC, we placed greater emphasis on a very significant, albeit temporary, intervention which can significantly improve the patient's condition and could be considered a routine in other populations of ICU patients. Based on our results, even a short period of atelectasia plays an important role in the production of hypoxemia in latter phases; consequently, considering the OLC strategy, even at definite special times, can have a significant preventive effect for hypoxemia.",
