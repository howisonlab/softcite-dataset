Material and methods: Between January 1998 and December 2005, a total of 39 men with breast cancer treated at Alexandria Main University Hospital and their medical records were reviewed. Results: The median age of patients was 59 years. Only 3 (7.7%) patients had positive family history. All patients presented by breast swellings that were associated with axillary mass in about one third of them. Around 80% had hormone receptor positive (estrogen and/or progesterone receptors). Two third of patients had advanced T-stage (T3 and T4). Left sided breast cancer occurred in 51.3%. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most common type of histology encountered and grade 2 was the predominant grade of tumor. Modified radical mastectomy was the most common (87.2%) type of surgery done followed by chemotherapy for 32 patients and loco-regional radiotherapy for 20 patients. Tamoxifen was administered in 31 patients. Distant relapse occurred in 7 patients (17.9%) and local recurrence occurred in 2 patients (5.1%). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 82% and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 84%. Only negative axillary lymph node and positive hormone receptor status were significantly associated with favorable DFS and OS. T-stage, grade of tumor and type of chemotherapy given had no statistically significant impact on either DFS or OS. Conclusions: Male breast cancer is still under-investigated and further researches are warranted.",

In central and eastern Africa breast cancer rates are higher and reach 6% of cancers in men, which could be explained by hyperestrogenism due to endemic hepatic infectious disease [3]. A large epidemiological study has shown a growing incidence of male breast cancer of 1% in one year [1]. The male-to-female ratio of incidence in breast cancer is about 1% in western countries, but it was markedly higher in North Africa -2.7% and even higher in Sub-Saharan countries -4.9%. Moreover, in Africa the age at diagnosis of breast cancer was seven years later in men than in women [4].",

Five-year survival was 100% for the node-negative subset and 60% for the node-positive subset.
