Objective: To assess colostrum avoidance practices and associated factors among mothers of children aged <24 months in Raya Kobo district, Northeastern Ethiopia. Methods: A quantitative community-based cross-sectional study supplemented by qualitative method was used. Descriptive statistics, binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used in the statistical analysis. Results: Colostrum avoidance was practiced by 13.5% (95% confidence interval: 10.99-16.33) of mothers having children aged <24 months. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, giving birth at home, mother-heading households, lack of awareness on the advantages of colostrum and late initiation of breastfeeding remained statistically significant factors associated with colostrum avoidance practices. Conclusion: Promoting institutional delivery, timely initiation of breastfeeding and creating awareness on the advantages of colostrum feeding are recommended interventions to reduce colostrum avoidance."

Studies showed that globally 60% of infant and young child deaths attributed to suboptimal breastfeeding practices [1][2][3]. Suboptimal breastfeeding is responsible for 45% of neonatal infectious deaths, 30% of diarrheal deaths and 18% of acute respiratory deaths in children <5 years of age [4]. The risk of mortality due to diarrheal and other infectious diseases is higher in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all [1]. In Ethiopia, about 18% of the infant deaths have been attributed to poor feeding practices [5].",

            "text": "Breastfeeding practices are suboptimal in Raya Kobo district of North-eastern Ethiopia. In this study the prevalence of colostrum avoidance was 13.5% (95% CI: 10.99-16.33), which is higher than the prevalence of colostrum avoidance reported from Kersa district, South-eastern Ethiopia (8.5%) [16]. The national prevalence of colostrum avoidance was reported as 39.8% [14]. A relatively consistent prevalence of colostrum avoidance was found in the city of Bahir Dar (16.7%), north-western Ethiopia [17]. This could be due to the fact that the culture of Bahir Dar community is relatively similar to Raya Kobo district; both areas are dominated by the Amhara ethnic group. Colostrum avoidance is lower in Ethiopia as compared with the prevalence found in India (76.0%) [18] and Kuwait (81.8%) [19].",

Similarly, colostrum is discarded primarily because of lack of basic information about the importance of colostrum for infants in Somali [9]. In addition, qualitative findings in Raya Kobo showed that, mothers thought colostrum as yellowish-dirty milk that is not good for infants. A study in Tigray region of Ethiopia also revealed that colostrum is perceived as not good for infants, and more than half of the mothers had no knowledge on colostrum feeding [20]. Other studies from Goba, South-eastern Ethiopia and Jimma Arjo, South-western Ethiopia districts also found that colostrum is believed to cause disease [10,21]. There were also similar findings from Foni Kansala district of Gambia [22]. Late initiation of breastfeeding was associated with colostrum avoidance practices. Compared with mothers who initiated breastfeeding within 1 h of delivery, mothers who initiated breastfeeding beyond 1 h of delivery were 2.4 times more likely to discard colostrum. This could be because of the fact that those mothers who discarded the colostrum might take more time to discard it and initiate breastfeeding later. The reverse might be also correct. When mothers tend to initiate breastfeeding later, they would have more time for infant feeding malpractices like colostrum avoidance.",

Similarly, in India, mothers who gave birth at home were more likely to discard colostrum compared with mothers who gave birth at health institutions [23]. Grandmothers and traditional birth attendants usually attend the birth in homes. The FGDs and in-depth interviews findings showed that grandmothers and traditional birth attendants thought colostrum caused abdominal cramps in infants. Therefore, giving birth at home may create a favorable environment for different socio-cultural malpractices such as the practice of colostrum avoidance. Alternatively, mothers who gave birth in health institutions might be advised by health professionals about the advantages of colostrum. Household-head mothers were 2.6 times more likely to discard colostrum compared with mothers who were not household heads. This could be explained in such a way that mothers who were household heads might be self-directed and may lack the supportive advice offered on the importance of colostrum feeding for newborns compared with mothers who were not household heads.",
