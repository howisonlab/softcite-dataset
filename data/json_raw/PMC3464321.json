            "text": "Glaucoma is a progressive disease characterized by pathological loss of ganglion cells and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) [1-3]. Detecting disease progression, which is evidenced by structural or functional changes in the retinas of patients with glaucoma, is essential to evaluate damage and the efficacy of therapy [4]. Repeated measurements of RNFL thickness in the same patient over time are an important component of glaucoma management. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides crosssectional imaging of the eye and enables evaluation and quantification of cross-sectional peripapillary RNFL thickness [5]. Time domain (TD)-OCT is a commonly used technique for which the Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec,",

Many patients who have been scanned with Stratus OCT can now potentially be scanned with Cirrus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec) [8]. The clinical relevance of the new SD technology requires data from these devices to be compared with preexisting, widely accepted TD standards and with each other [9].",

Additionally, a significant proportional bias of the mean RNFL thickness measurements existed between the Stratus and Cirrus devices (r = -0.233, p < 0.001).

In contrast, the effects of intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, spherical equivalent, axial length, and anterior chamber depth on the estimated SD-OCT RNFL thickness were negligible (Table  2). Variables with a p-value less than 0.1 were included in the final model. Because mean deviation and pattern standard deviation were highly correlated with each other, only mean deviation was included in the multivariate stepwise regression analyses. Table 3 shows the results of the multivariate stepwise regression analyses used for the prediction of SD-OCT RNFL thickness. The multiple linear regression analysis generated the following prediction equation: SD-OCT RNFL thickness = 0.746 \u00d7 TD-OCT RNFL thickness + 17.104. The R 2 value indicates that the model explains 87.9% of the variability between the TD-OCT and SD-OCT RNFL thicknesses (residual variance = 5.125). TD-OCT RNFL thickness was the only significant factor in the final model, which did not change based on inclusion of various variable combination sets. The R 2 of the final equation was similar to that of an equation which did not consider any demographic or clinical variables (equation 1).",

Relationship between predicted SD-OCT RNFL thickness and measured thickness Table 4 shows the categorical comparison of the absolute difference between the TD-OCT and SD-OCT measurements or between the observed and predicted SD-OCT RNFL thicknesses. For RNFLs of average thickness, the difference between the SD-OCT and TD-OCT measurements was within 10 \u03bcm in 152 (69.1%) patients and within 5 \u03bcm in 81 (36.8%) patients. SD-OCT and TD-OCT measurements differed by more than 15 \u03bcm in 23 (10.5%) patients. Comparing the observed and calculated SD-OCT RNFL measurements using our formula revealed no measurements differences greater than 15 \u03bcm. A predicted average RNFL thickness within 10 \u03bcm of the observed measurement was detected in 210 (95.5%) eyes and that within 5 \u03bcm of the observed measurement was detected in 121 (55.0%) eyes. Fig. 3 shows a scatter plot of the measured versus predicted SD-OCT RNFL thickness values as determined by    our regression model.

To improve the predictive accuracy of our equation, clinical and demographic variables were included in addition to the TD-OCT RNFL measurements. Univariate analysis showed that factors associated with greater SD-OCT RNFL thickness included greater TD-OCT RNFL thickness, younger age, larger disc area, higher mean deviation, and lower pattern standard deviation. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was then used to determine the best combination set of variables to predict SD-OCT RNFL thickness.

            "text": "OCT measurements are not interchangeable and should be interpreted considering the various scanning protocols and segmentation algorithms of different devices [9,10].  The reason underlying this difference in OCT techniques may be that new OCT systems involve improved axial resolution compared to the previous generation [20]. By producing higher resolution scans compared to TD-OCT, SD-OCT may provide measurements that reflect a more accurate delineation of RNFL margins [11]. Alternatively, the discrepancy in measurements may be related to intrinsic differences between the instruments and software edge-detection algorithms that measure the RNFL [11,14]. The segmentation algorithms for TD-OCT and SD-OCT are different: Cirrus identifies the bottom of the nerve fiber layer, whereas Stratus localizes the top of the ganglion cell layer [8]. Another reason for the differences may be because the scan registration process performed by the Cirrus algorithms is fully automated, which reduces the likelihood of operator error [10,11,14,20,21]. Bland-Altman plots showed that, for thinner RNFLs, the Stratus measurement values tended to be smaller compared to values determined by Cirrus. In cases of great RNFL thicknesses, Stratus measurements tended to be thicker than measurements determined by Cirrus. These results are generally consistent with earlier studies reporting differences in the measurement values between 3D OCT-1000 (Topcon Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA) and Stratus OCT [12], RTVue-100 (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) and Stratus OCT [13], and Cirrus OCT and Stratus OCT [8][9][10][11]21]. A possible explanation why Cirrus OCT yields thicker measurements in severely diseased eyes and thinner measurements in healthy eyes compared to Stratus OCT is the difference in the inclusion of exposed blood vessels in the measurements [8]. In cases of thin RNFLs, the TD-OCT algorithm is not sufficiently sensitive to local changes and includes few of the blood vessels in regions where most of the axons are lost, while the SD-OCT algorithm incorporates most of the blood vessels when determining RNFL thickness. In contrast, the SD-OCT algorithm is sensitive to local signal changes and thus does not include the shadows of the blood vessels present in thick RNFLs, whereas TD-OCT does include shadows from major blood vessels [12].",

Multivariate analysis results indicated that no factors were useful as covariates for constructing a predictive formula for SD-OCT RNFL thickness. The results showed that a formula considering clinical and demographic variables was not able to more precisely predict SD-OCT RNFL thickness than a simple formula. A possible explanation is that the relationship between clinical/ demographic variables and TD-OCT RNFL measurements is very similar to the relationship between these variables and SD-OCT RNFL measurements. RNFL thickness as measured by TD-OCT was associated with age ( p = 0.002), disc area ( p = 0.004), mean deviation ( p < 0.001), pattern standard deviation ( p < 0.001), and signal strength ( p < 0.001). Consistent with TD-OCT, RNFL thickness as measured by SD-OCT was associated with age (p = 0.015), optic disc area ( p = 0.002), mean deviation ( p < 0.001), pattern standard deviation ( p < 0.001), and signal strength ( p = 0.010).",

However, the limit of agreement range (average bias \u00b1 1.96 standard deviation of the difference) was relatively broad (-10.3 to 10.2 \u03bcm). The limits of axial resolution for the Stratus OCT and Cirrus OCT instruments is taken as 10 \u03bcm and 5 \u03bcm, respectively [20,22]. The 95% limit of agreement between the observed and predicted values was 20.5 \u03bcm and was greater than the limit of resolution of both the Stratus OCT and the Cirrus OCT.",

The clinical utility of any instrument depends on the reproducibility of its measurements. With SD technology, the image acquisition time and resolution are improved compared with those of the TD-OCT technique. The reproducibility of RNFL measurements with the SD-OCT was reported to be higher than that with the TD-OCT both in normal participants and in patients with glaucoma [23,24]. However, our formula calculated SD-OCT RNFL thickness from TD-OCT RNFL values. Therefore, predicted SD-OCT RNFL measurements have greater test-retest variability than those expected with actual SD-OCT scanning.",

Thus, the performance of the equation in populations with different distributions of patient characteristics may not be the same as the performance observed in the validation sample. Signal strength was not considered in the present study. Because signal strength has been shown to affect RNFL thickness measurements using TD-OCT [25], the differences in signal strength between the two instruments may be a possible cause of variability [11,26]. However, only scans with adequate signal strength were included in the present study, and no differences in signal strength were observed between scans taken with the two devices (paired t-test, p = 0.437). Lastly, caution should be taken in direct application of this formula in everyday clinical practice. Although this formula has a definite practical advantage in SD-OCT RNFL prediction, the limit of agreement widths between observed and predicted SD-OCT RNFL thicknesses were high, and the difference between measurements was greater than 5 \u03bcm in 45% of the patients. A comprehensive general assessment is required to interpret the predicted values.",

The inclusion of other clinical and demographic factors to correct TD-OCT RNFL thickness did not improve the prediction accuracy in this study group.
