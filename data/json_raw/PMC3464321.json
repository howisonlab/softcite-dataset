Detecting disease progression, which is evidenced by structural or functional changes in the retinas of patients with glaucoma, is essential to evaluate damage and the efficacy of therapy [4]. Repeated measurements of RNFL thickness in the same patient over time are an important component of glaucoma management. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides crosssectional imaging of the eye and enables evaluation and quantification of cross-sectional peripapillary RNFL thickness [5]. Time domain (TD)-OCT is a commonly used technique for which the Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec,"

Many patients who have been scanned with Stratus OCT can now potentially be scanned with Cirrus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec) [8]. The clinical relevance of the new SD technology requires data from these devices to be compared with preexisting, widely accepted TD standards and with each other [9].",

A predicted average RNFL thickness within 10 \u03bcm of the observed measurement was detected in 210 (95.5%) eyes and that within 5 \u03bcm of the observed measurement was detected in 121 (55.0%) eyes. Fig. 3 shows a scatter plot of the measured versus predicted SD-OCT RNFL thickness values as determined by    our regression model. As expected, the RNFL thickness measurements predicted with our formula systematically deviated only minimally from the measured SD-OCT RNFL thickness (slope = 0.881, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.872, SE of estimate = 4.93).",

The present study provides an equation that can predict SD-OCT RNFL measurements using conventional TD-OCT RNFL measurements. Other formulas have been proposed to calculate SD-OCT RNFL thicknesses [8,15], but none have adjusted for demographic and clinical variables. To improve the predictive accuracy of our equation, clinical and demographic variables were included in addition to the TD-OCT RNFL measurements. Univariate analysis showed that factors associated with greater SD-OCT RNFL thickness included greater TD-OCT RNFL thickness, younger age, larger disc area, higher mean deviation, and lower pattern standard deviation. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was then used to determine the best combination set of variables to predict SD-OCT RNFL thickness. The results of the analysis indicated that the best and final equation included only TD-OCT RNFL thickness.",

            "text": "OCT measurements are not interchangeable and should be interpreted considering the various scanning protocols and segmentation algorithms of different devices [9,10].  The reason underlying this difference in OCT techniques may be that new OCT systems involve improved axial resolution compared to the previous generation [20]. By producing higher resolution scans compared to TD-OCT, SD-OCT may provide measurements that reflect a more accurate delineation of RNFL margins [11]. Alternatively, the discrepancy in measurements may be related to intrinsic differences between the instruments and software edge-detection algorithms that measure the RNFL [11,14]. The segmentation algorithms for TD-OCT and SD-OCT are different: Cirrus identifies the bottom of the nerve fiber layer, whereas Stratus localizes the top of the ganglion cell layer [8]. Another reason for the differences may be because the scan registration process performed by the Cirrus algorithms is fully automated, which reduces the likelihood of operator error [10,11,14,20,21]. Bland-Altman plots showed that, for thinner RNFLs, the Stratus measurement values tended to be smaller compared to values determined by Cirrus. In cases of great RNFL thicknesses, Stratus measurements tended to be thicker than measurements determined by Cirrus. These results are generally consistent with earlier studies reporting differences in the measurement values between 3D OCT-1000 (Topcon Inc., Paramus, NJ, USA) and Stratus OCT [12], RTVue-100 (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) and Stratus OCT [13], and Cirrus OCT and Stratus OCT [8][9][10][11]21]. A possible explanation why Cirrus OCT yields thicker measurements in severely diseased eyes and thinner measurements in healthy eyes compared to Stratus OCT is the difference in the inclusion of exposed blood vessels in the measurements [8]. In cases of thin RNFLs, the TD-OCT algorithm is not sufficiently sensitive to local changes and includes few of the blood vessels in regions where most of the axons are lost, while the SD-OCT algorithm incorporates most of the blood vessels when determining RNFL thickness. In contrast, the SD-OCT algorithm is sensitive to local signal changes and thus does not include the shadows of the blood vessels present in thick RNFLs, whereas TD-OCT does include shadows from major blood vessels [12].",

Multivariate analysis results indicated that no factors were useful as covariates for constructing a predictive formula for SD-OCT RNFL thickness.

A possible explanation is that the relationship between clinical/ demographic variables and TD-OCT RNFL measurements is very similar to the relationship between these variables and SD-OCT RNFL measurements. RNFL thickness as measured by TD-OCT was associated with age ( p = 0.002), disc area ( p = 0.004), mean deviation ( p < 0.001), pattern standard deviation ( p < 0.001), and signal strength ( p < 0.001).

The findings indicate that the application of this formula yields an accurate SD-OCT RNFL thickness predicted from TD-OCT RNFL thickness in healthy participants and patients with glaucoma. The inclusion of other clinical and demographic factors to correct TD-OCT RNFL thickness did not improve the prediction accuracy in this study group. Validation with a larger cohort and broader distribution of other possible confounding variables is warranted."
