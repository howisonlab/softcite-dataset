            "text": "OBJECTIVES: The incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) after open vein harvesting in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients ranges in different studies between 2 and 20%. Triclosan is an antibacterial substance that reduces the growth of bacteria by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis. We hypothesized that wound closure with triclosan-coated sutures would reduce SSI after open vein harvesting. METHODS: An investigator-initiated prospective randomized double-blind single-centre study was performed with 374 patients, randomized to subcutaneous and intracutaneous leg-wound closure with either triclosan-coated sutures (Vicryl Plus \u00ae and Monocryl Plus \u00ae , Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) (n = 184) or identical sutures without triclosan (n = 190) from the same manufacturer. All patients were followed up after 30 days (clinical visit) and 60 days (telephone interview). Primary endpoint was SSI within 60 days after surgery according to the definition of Center for Disease Control. Predefined secondary endpoints included culture-proven and antibiotictreated SSI. RESULTS: The primary endpoint occurred in 23 patients (12.5%) with triclosan-coated sutures and in 38 patients (20.0%) in the group without triclosan (P = 0.0497, risk ratio 0.63, (95% confidence interval 0.39-1.00). Corresponding figures for culture-proven infections were 7.6 vs 12.1%, (P = 0.15), and for antibiotic-treated infections, 10.9 vs 18.4%, (P = 0.039). Staphylococcus aureus and coagulasenegative staphylococci were the most common pathogens in both groups. Insulin-treated diabetes and vein-harvesting time were associated with SSI after vein harvesting. CONCLUSIONS: Leg-wound closure with triclosan-coated sutures in CABG patients reduces SSIs after open vein harvesting. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01212315).",

The incidence of SSI after vein harvesting is usually in the 5-10% range, however, rates from 2 to 20% have been reported in different studies [2][3][4]. The large variation in incidence between studies can at least partly be explained by wide differences in the definition of SSI and the length of the observation period.",

Another factor that may influence the incidence of SSI in CABG patients is the suture used for closure of the wound, since bacteria may adhere to the suture material [5]. Sutures can be coated with antibacterial substances that may reduce the bacterial load in the wound. Triclosan (2,4,4-trichloro-2-hydroxydiphenylether) is an antibacterial substance that, in preclinical studies, has been shown to reduce the growth of bacteria by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis [6]. Triclosan has been used in topical preparations for antibacterial purposes. Furthermore, triclosan-coated sutures are commercially available and have been clinically tested in different surgical procedures with diverging results [7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16]. One randomized controlled trial, comparing triclosan-coated sutures with identical sutures without coating in CABG patients, failed to demonstrate a difference in the incidence of leg-wound SSI [13].",

These studies have been followed by both non-randomized retrospective studies and prospective controlled trials in different surgical populations to test if triclosan-coated sutures reduce SSIs. However, the results have been conflicting. Rozelle et al. [12] reported reduced incidence of infections with triclosan-coated sutures in wound closure for cerebrospinal fluid shunts in a prospective randomized trial, and Justinger and co-workers reported similar results from two non-randomized studies after abdominal surgery [10,11]. Furthermore, Galal et al. [8] reported a reduced infection rate in a prospective randomized study in mixed surgical patients. On the other hand, Baracs et al. [7] found no difference in infection incidence in a randomized controlled trial in abdominal surgery, and both Williams et al. [16] and Turtianien et al. [15] reported the same outcome after breast-cancer surgery and lower-limb vascular surgery, respectively. In cardiacsurgery patients, Stadler et al. [14] found no difference in sternal wound infection in a retrospective study and in a randomized study, Isik et al. [9] found no difference in either sternal wound or leg-wound infections. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials with triclosan-coated sutures, Chang et al. [21] concluded that triclosan-impregnated sutures do not decrease the rate of SSI, but also pointed out that the quality of the studies were moderate and further high-quality independent studies are required.",

Seim's study was not blinded and outcome measures were based on self-reports from the patients, not on a structured follow-up with trained observers blinded to group assignment. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the length of the follow-up differed in these two studies. In Seim et al.'s study, the follow-up was restricted to 30 days while in the present study, the final follow-up occurred 60 days after surgery. Our decision to follow the patients for 60 days was based on a previous study from Swenne et al. [4] where 27% of the leg-wound infections were diagnosed between 30 and 60 days after surgery and a study from Jonkers et al. [22] where 37% of leg-wound infections were diagnosed after 30 days. These results were confirmed in the present study where 19/61 of the leg-wound infections (31%) were diagnosed between postoperative days 30 and 60 (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Our extended follow-up may also, at least partially, explain the high incidence of leg-wound SSI in the present study. The incidence of SSI ranges in different studies between 2 and 20% depending on definition, the follow-up time, system of reporting infections and design of the study [2][3][4]. It is well known that the rate of complications is higher in prospective trials with mandatory follow-up than in retrospective studies. However, the high incidence of SSI is troublesome, and new methods and measures are warranted to reduce its incidence. One possibility is to use    endoscopic vein harvesting, as this has been shown to lower the risk of wound infections in comparison to open conventional techniques [23]. Of the known risk factors for SSI after vein harvesting, only insulin-treated diabetes mellitus was associated with SSI in the present study. In addition, vein-harvesting time emerged as a risk factor for SSI. The association between veinharvesting time and SSI remained after adjustment for the experience of the assisting surgeon (data not shown) and the length of the incision. This suggests that a more complicated vein-harvesting procedure increases the risk for SSI. The discrepancy in risk factors between different studies indicates that risk factors for SSI in cardiac surgery may be local rather than general.",

            "text": "Even though our results suggest the use of triclosan-coated sutures in order to lower the risk for SSIs, two important aspects of triclosan use in health care products should be discussed. First, it has been shown that there is a risk of antimicrobial resistance to triclosan, including its use in topical products (e.g. cosmetics) where resistance to populations of S. aureus has been reported [24]. This must be regarded as a major drawback in the use of triclosan as resistance to antibacterial substances represents a growing problem in modern medicine. On the other hand, if the use of conventional antibiotics in patients with SSI can be reduced by 40% with triclosan-coated sutures, as the results of the present study suggest, this may balance or outweigh the disadvantages. The second issue is the long degradation time of triclosan and the potential risk for bioaccumulation in the environment [25].",
