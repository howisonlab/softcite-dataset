We present the advantages of the negotiation support systems discussing their different functions and typologies focusing later on the possibilities of decision support they can give to the negotiating parties in all negotiation phases. After presenting the most popular solutions we introduce also two of our own procedures that can be applied in the pre-negotiation phase for eliciting negotiators' preferences and building the offers' scoring systems for the parties. The first one is based on the Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa's procedure of even swaps, while the second derives from the Roy's ELECTRE-TRI. Both of them can be easily applied as the analytic engines in electronic negotiation systems replacing the classical additive scoring systems. We discuss also the issue of using different scoring systems in the successive negotiation phases.",

            "text": "Negotiation is an everyday task. Except for simple and typical situations like discussing the task shared in a family (i.e. walking the dog, cleaning the apartment, etc.) influencing someone to change their mind or dividing the scarce resources, it includes also the complex deliberations between the companies, political parties or nations. We can describe negotiation situation as the problem of making decision about parties' interdependent goals and objectives (Lewicki et al. 1999). Moreover, the parties are committed to peaceful means of solving the problem and there is no clear or established method of making the decision. Usually, while thinking of the negotiation we consider a regular face-to-face meeting where the parties are sitting at the negotiation table and solving the problem using some advisors, analysts, facilitators or mediators. But we live in the time of technological explosion, and nowadays it influences nearly all the activities undertaken by humans, including negotiation. Negotiations are consequently being conducted by means of the electronic media, starting with simple phone calls, through the videoconferences, online chatting, with the use of software negotiation support system (NSS), ending with the electronic negotiation system (ENS) -a software that employs Internet technologies and is deployed on the web for the purpose of facilitating, organizing, supporting and/or automating activities undertaken by the negotiators and/or the third party (Kersten and Lai 2007). More and more people and organizations are deciding to negotiate electronically, since it saves time and money and allows to develop and maintain the business contacts regardless of the distance of time and space between the counterparts. Therefore, the negotiation support tools are still being developed to make the negotiation process more fluent and bring negotiators closer to the most satisfying agreement. Usually, these systems implement the formal models deriving from operational research and decision science that are used to help negotiators define negotiation space, evaluate offers and determine efficient solutions. There are a lot of NSSs and ENSs that have been used for simulating, training and teaching negotiations or for research purposes like INSPIRE (Kersten and Noronha 1999), Negoisst (Schoop et al. 2003), NeGoGo (Lai et al. 2007) or NegoCalc (Wachowicz 2008). Lots of theoretical and practical solutions for electronic negotiation support are also proposed in the literature, that focuse on both the methodological and applicational aspects of electronic negotiations (see Stroebel and Weinhardt 2003;Urbanavi\u010dien\u0117 et al. 2009a, b). Unfortunately, there are only a few examples of using the formal models and systems in the large and complex real-world negotiations of business or political nature. One of them was introducing the Deep Ocean Mining Model into the United Nations' UNCLOS III negotiations (Sebenius 1984) concerning the rights to exploit the deep sea. It allowed to make a consensus between the developed and developing countries according to the profits sharing. Another system, developed by International Institute for Applied System Analysis, is RAINS (Hordijk 1991), which was used in the international negotiations between the European countries on the air pollution limits. Some other systems are still being developed to support real-world problems like Familly_Winner (Bellucci and Zeleznikow 2005) designed on Victoria University, Australia, for supporting divorcing disputes or Smartsettle (Thiessen and Soberg 2003), which is now being adapted to support negotiations between First Nations and the Government of Alberta Province in Canada (Thiessen and Shakun 2009).",

In the first section we discuss the fundamental elements of negotiation process and analyze the different types of NSSs that can be used for supporting different aspects of negotiation process. In the successive sections we consider the subsequent negotiation phases. Considering the pre-negotiation phase we focus on negotiators' preference elicitation and process of building offers' scoring systems that require formal modeling and usually implement an additive scoring system. We also propose two alternative solutions that can be introduced instead of classical additive scoring system. Next we describe the support that can be given within the actual negotiation phase for exchanging the messages and offers and analyzing the negotiation progress. Afterwards, we analyze the post-negotiation mechanisms that can be introduced by NSS to help negotiators evaluate the compromise and find better solutions.",

            "text": "In vast majority of situations the basis of negotiation is some form of conflict. But negotiation and conflict are not the same thing. As far as conflict is the perception of differences of interest among people, negotiation is a decision making process in which two or many people make joint decision about the allocation of scarce resources (Thompson 1998). Since we perceive negotiation as a decision making process we need to be aware of multitude tasks the parties must accomplish to obtain the satisfying solution. Negotiators need to understand the essence of the conflict (i.e. to diagnose the negotiation problem), gather all information required (e.g. about the problem, parties, possible solutions) and process it to manage the negotiation process well (e.g. analyze the counterpart's personality, select negotiation strategies, etc.). Negotiation thus is a very complex activity, which requires from the parties many skills of the behavioral and analytical nature to cope with different problems that can appear during the negotiation process. This process in not uniform, and depending on the stage of the conflict it may require different tasks to perform or problems to solve. There are many proposals of dividing the negotiation process into separate phases (Douglas 1962;Morley and Stephenson 1977). Some of them are quite general, like a six-phase model of Greenhalgh (2001) including preparing, relation building, information gathering, information using, submitting offers, closing and implementing agreement; others are specific to negotiation problems or context, like Four-Phase Model of Hostage Negotiation (Madrigal et al. 2009) that consists of establishing initial dialogue, building rapport, influencing, and Surrender; or a five phases model for negotiating transactions (Tafreschi et al. 2008) distinguishing the information, intention, agreement, execution and service phases. Here we will focus on a very general and straightforward categorization that allows to distinguish three main negotiation phases (Gulliver 1979): pre-negotiation phase, actual negotiation phase and post-negotiation phase.",

Negotiators should gather all the data and facts describing the present situation between the parties and the essence of conflict. Within the second stage -analysis stage -the data is processed. Parties should identify the strengths and weaknesses of both their own and their counterparts. The goals, intentions, positions, expectations, aspiration and reservation levels and BATNAs of the parties should also be identified. It will lead to the construction of negotiation space, identification of possible alternatives and determination of the zone of possible agreement (Raiffa 1982). Then in the last stage -organizing the meeting -the negotiators, facilitators and analysts are chosen, the negotiation place and agenda are also prepared. These three stages lead to formulating a direct plan, linking the overall goals with operational tactics which we call a negotiation strategy (Kuhn 1999).",

The next, called mutual influencing, consists in revealing negotiators' views and emotions and is strongly connected with the third element -negotiation maneuvers -which includes all the specific tactics and techniques, both constructive and destructive ones, that are to move negotiators towards the aspired agreement (see Aaronson 1989). These three stages can be repeated iteratively but then stabilizing is required, which will lead the negotiators to the stage of reaching agreement that consists in exchanging the proposals for the final compromise. This entire process starting from the first offer and ending with the mutual agreement is also known as a negotiation dance (Raiffa 1982).",

It is often conducted by means of formal models that help negotiators to evaluate the compromise and, using some elements of mathematical programming, find the effective solutions that dominate the current compromise. It is also the time for conclusions and summarizing the lessons learned that negotiators make use of during the future negotiations.",

These systems do not verify requirements and assumptions defined by users and expect all the data required to be provided by negotiators. 2. Active facilitation-mediation systems support the whole decision making process in negotiations, starting with problem definition and structuring, and ending with producing the final results in the form of offers that can be suggested as the agreement proposals. They support also concession-making process, and the final assessment of the agreement. The models implemented in these systems take into consideration simultaneously the problem, the negotiators and the process. 3.

The mix of these elements determines in fact the role NSS plays in the negotiations as a third party.

Therefore analyzing the role NSS plays in the negotiation process we can distinguish three types of negotiations (Kersten and Lai 2007): 1. Computer-facilitated negotiations use software with communication and coordination components implemented only. The technology used do not affect the content of communications therefore the decision and concession making process depends only on the skills of the negotiators. In terms of decision support the system acts passively, however it can inform negotiators of the current stage of talks (e.g. send emails informing of new compromise proposals prepared by counterpart in the system). 2. Computer-supported negotiations use software that can provide negotiators with the information they would not be able to obtain otherwise. This software affects the negotiation process and parties by organizing the negotiation activities and proposing individual mechanisms for analyzing the data and understanding the problem better, like simulation tool or preference elicitation engines.",

All the formal models required for such a support derive from the negotiation analysis (Young 1991;Raiffa 1982;Raiffa et al. 2002) which is a huge and modern trend within the decision science. The common idea of these models is to define the negotiation outcome quantitatively and use some methods from game theory and multiple attribute decision making to evaluate the implication of the potential solutions and find the efficient, fair or compromising agreement (Luce and Raiffa 1957;Keeney and Raiffa 1976;Brams 1990;Zeckhauser et al. 1996;Hammond et al. 2002).

The system allows also to follow the negotiation progress by analyzing the concession paths -the shape of the graph built with scores of successive offers submitted both by the negotiator himself and his counterpart.

            "text": "But there are some disadvantages of additive scoring system. The first is that the scores negotiators use need to be simply assigned to the issues and options instead of determining them -deriving from their preferences defined verbally (Saaty 2001). What is more, operating with utility or desirability scores requires from negotiators some mathematical skills and at least a basic knowledge of decision theory, otherwise the global scores may be misinterpreted or, which is worse, the whole scoring system may not reflect the true preferences of negotiator. The second problem is that negotiators do not have to assume full compensation between the issues. Negotiation experiments conducted by Wachowicz and Kersten (2009) show that negotiators very often reject some alternative solutions proposed by ENS despite they result in the higher score than the current negotiation agreement. It happens because these alternative solutions do not meet the minimal accepted levels for one or more issues. Therefore some alternative solutions are proposed based, for instance, on AHP (Mustajoki and Hamalainen 2000), outranking methods (Wachowicz and Wiesza\u0142a 2009;Ulubeyli and Kazaz 2009) or verbal analysis (Ustinovichius et al. 2009).",

It derives from the concept of vector domination assuming that each dominated alternative can be eliminated from the decision process, since it cannot be recommended to the decision maker as the most satisfying one. Furthermore it emphasizes that if all the alternatives result in equal consequences for any criterion, this criterion can be ignored in the decision making process as well (eliminated). Then, the even-swap method tries to adjust the consequences of all considered alternatives to make them equivalent in terms of a given objective, which requires increasing the value of one alternative in terms of one objective while decreasing its value by the equivalent amount in terms of another objective. The equivalent amounts are defined subjectively by the decision maker and reflect the structure of his preferences.

Comparing these two houses we see that House 2 is cheaper but with longer building time than House 1 (investor wants to minimize both the criteria). No vector domination occurs. Investor needs to conduct then the even-swap analysis between two criteria. According to the procedure he will try to adjust the consequences of these two alternatives to become equal in terms of building time -say, both to be realized within 18 months. House 1 is going to be built within this time, but House 2 not. Investor needs to declare thus an equivalent amount (in terms of thousands of dollars) that will describe what the costs of shortening the building time form 20 to 18 months are. Let us assume that he evaluates the difference as $15,000 price equivalent. This amount may reflect some objective costs that decision maker needs to pay for waiting two moths longer for a new house, but also all the subjective and \"non-measurable\" costs (e.g. the costs of two months longer irritation for an annoying neighbor that lives next door and plays piano until midnight everyday) may (and should) be taken into consideration as well. Now, the equivalent amount can be added to the actual price of House 2 and Table 1 can be rewritten to Table 2. Since both alternatives result in the same value for criterion \"building time\", it can be eliminated from the decision making problem. After this elimination investor considers between these two alternatives analyzing only the criterion of price, therefore House 2 will be selected as the most preferable solution, since it is cheaper than House 1.",

All the modifications required were previously described in details by Wachowicz (2007). The modified procedure requires four step analysis: 1. Defining of the base issue. Base issue is used as a global score for the offers evaluation (like utility payoff in additive scoring system). It is chosen from the set of all negotiation issues that parties agreed to negotiate. It is recommended to choose the quantitative issue as the base, which will make the interpretation of the global scores much easier (it is easier to understand the difference between two prices: $200 and $250, than to understand the difference between two verbal descriptions: interesting and very interesting). 2. Defining the base options for all issues. Making all the offers equal for one particular issue requires selecting the base option as a common result for all the offers. It is recommended to use the best option (i.e. the one that satisfied each issue the most) as a base. The equivalent amount defined then for other options may be interpreted as the cost of upgrading the offer's consequence to the best possible resolution. 3. Assigning the equivalent amounts for options within issues. For each issue separately the negotiator needs to compare all the options with the base option and define the equivalent amount for the differences between them (the base option receives the equivalent amount of 0). These equivalent amounts for the quantitative base issue are calculated automatically as the differences between the actual values of the options. 4. It is allowed to conduct such a within-issue analysis because the even-swap method employs an additive aggregation of the scores, which means it assumes that the score associated with each option of one issue does not depend on the options of other issues (Keeney and Raiffa 1991).",

It can be troublesome, taking into consideration that these parameters are not so intuitive. Therefore, a few procedures were proposed to estimate the parameters of the ELECTRE-TRI model. One of them, by Mousseau and Slowinski (1998) -let us call it MS model -tries to determine the parameters by analyzing the assignment examples performed by the decision maker. The decision maker is asked to formulate examples of alternatives that he can easily classify to the categories. Basing on these assignments a simple quadratic programming model is constructed, solution of which allows to determine all the parameters except the veto thresholds.",

Negotiators can consider the offers from the lower category to be worse than the ones from higher category, but cannot distinguish the differences between the offers classified to the same category. To obtain higher precision of a scoring system a huge number of categories should be defined, but it automatically increases the number of examples negotiator needs to assign in the preliminary stage. We propose an alternative approach that allows for increasing a scoring system's precision, which bases on calibration of the outcomes obtained by solving MS model. The procedure of calibration imposes on negotiator the declaration of satisfaction level that comes from reaching each profile, which we denote u(b h ).

NSSs can help in analyzing the negotiation space of both the negotiators and finding the better solutions. It is quite a simple task for discrete negotiation problems that are supported by additive scoring systems or even-swap scoring systems. NSSs simply search a finite negotiation space and try to identify the offers that result in scores at least as good as the current compromise simultaneously for both the negotiators. The results of the electronic negotiation experiments show that NSSs find the solutions better than the negotiated agreement for 65% of all cases (Wachowicz and Kersten 2009). The post-negotiation optimization capabilities of NSSs seem to be very important because they are giving the opportunity to improve the agreement and consume the gains left on negotiation table. The results of post-negotiation optimization conducted by eNS Inspire are shown in Fig. 9. Knowing the scale of possible improvements negotiators can renegotiate the current agreement trying to move themselves to one of the solutions proposed by the system. But what is interesting, only 22% of negotiators that NSS suggested the improvements to, took an advantage of the renegotiation and improved their final score (Wachowicz and Kersten 2009). The rest of them decided to stay in the negotiated agreement claiming that the system proposals cannot be accepted (despite they resulted in higher score than an agreement) because these offers do not satisfy their reservation levels on some options. This explanation shows that negotiators reject sometimes the notion of compensation and the alternative scoring mechanisms, like the one based on calibrated ELECTRE-TRI, that should be implemented. However, there are yet no research works showing the post-negotiation capabilities of scoring systems based on ELECTRE-TRI or other outranking or sorting methods.",

This is a very interesting problem, since more and more negotiations are conducted in the electronic way and sooner or later negotiators will require professional tools that could efficiently help them in the conduct of negotiation. We described thus the structure of negotiation process and showed different possibilities of its support considering the role and activity NSSs can play. Then we tried to focus on the decision process that takes place in the pre-negotiation phase discussing the classical approach to eliciting preferences and building the offers' scoring system that was based on the additive scoring system with the utility payoffs. We tried to emphasize its simplicity showing also some disadvantages of it and proposing two alternative approaches. The first approach derived from Hammond, Keeney and Raiffa even-swap method also assumes full compensation on issues. The main difference in comparison with the utility based additive scoring system is the philosophy of defining the trade-offs. Here negotiators decide themselves what kind of units to use to express the overall score of offer. They select the base issue and try to evaluate all other options of all issues in terms of base one, using its units to define the equivalent amounts for swaps between issues.",

This ELECTRE-TRI based model in conjunction with the MS model for estimation of key parameters can become a very helpful and simple to use supporting tool. Instead of asking negotiators to assign the scores it tries to derive the preferences basing on the assignment examples. This indirect approach does not force negotiators to score each negotiation option separately and declare the abstract values (i.e. utilities, desirabilities) to what they can sometimes perceive as immeasurable. It only asks to formulate the alternatives that negotiators can judge intuitively to be good, medium or bad and then, using some assumptions, tries to identify the profiles that limit these categories. To increase the precision of such an evaluation we decided to calibrate the scoring system using satisfaction scores assigned to the initial profiles of the categories.",

The methods that can easily build the scoring system in the pre-negotiation phase deriving from the negotiators' decision or choices may not allow later for making any sophisticated analysis of the negotiation progress or the scale of concessions (i.e. the ELECTRE-TRI based scoring system).",
