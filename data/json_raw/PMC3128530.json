In cells lacking VimIFs or in which VimIF organization is disrupted, the motility of mitochondria is increased relative to control cells that express normal VimIF networks. Expression of wild-type VimIF in vimentin-null cells causes mitochondrial motility to return to normal (slower) rates. In contrast, expressing vimentin with mutations in the mid-region of the N-terminal non-\u03b1-helical domain (deletions of residues 41-96 or 45-70, or substitution of Pro-57 with Arg) did not inhibit mitochondrial motility even though these mutants retain their ability to assemble into VimIFs in vivo. It was also found that a vimentin peptide consisting of residues 41-94 localizes to mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggest that VimIFs bind directly or indirectly to mitochondria and anchor them within the cytoplasm.",

            "text": "Mitochondria are the major source of metabolic energy, and they regulate intracellular calcium levels and sequester apoptotic factors (Nicholls and Budd, 2000). To meet the varying energy demands of different regions of the cytoplasm, mitochondria require an efficient transport and tethering system. In support of this idea, it has been shown that mitochondria are delivered to and sequestered in areas of the cell where metabolic requirements are high (Morris and Hollenbeck, 1993;Chada and Hollenbeck, 2003). Mitochondrial transport involves microtubule-dependent kinesins and dyneins and actin-dependent myosins. Frequently, all three types of motors are present on the surface of a single mitochondrion and work in concert to maintain the organelle's correct intracellular localization (Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005). Pathological conditions in neurode-generative diseases are associated with disrupted transport of mitochondria in neural cells (Baloh, 2008).",

            "text": "There is evidence that the tethering of mitochondria involves intermediate filaments (IFs) (Linden et al., 1989;Leterrier et al., 1994;Wagner et al., 2003). In vertebrate cells, IFs form extensive interconnected cytoskeletal networks that extend throughout the cytoplasm (Goldman et al., 2008). Depending on the cell type, cytoskeletal IFs are assembled from one or more of a large multigene family of \u223c70 members (Herrmann et al., 2009). Each type of IF protein chain contains a highly conserved \u03b1-helical central rod domain flanked by variable, non-\u03b1-helical head and tail domains (Herrmann and Aebi, 2000). The rod domains are responsible for the assembly of the dimers (which are the building blocks of IF), and the head and tail regions are thought to be exposed on the surface of mature 10-nm IF, thereby providing potential binding sites for other proteins and organelles, such as mitochondria. In support of this supposition, IFs have been implicated in docking mitochondria in muscle cells (Milner et al., 2000;Stone et al., 2007), nerve cells (Straube-West et al., 1996;Wagner et al., 2003), and fibroblasts (Mose-Larsen et al., 1982;Summerhayes et al., 1983). There is also evidence that type III VimIFs and neurofilament heavy chain, a type IV IF protein, bind directly to mitochondria in vitro and that mitochondrial functions require IFs (Milner et al., 2000;Wagner et al., 2003;Tolstonog et al., 2005;Tao et al., 2009). Mitochondria can also associate with IF through interactions with the cytolinker, plectin (Reipert et al., 1999;Rezniczek et al., 2003;Winter et al., 2008); and the depletion of taining the N-terminal domain and the 1A \u03b1-helical domain of the central rod fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Vim (1-138) . EGFP-Vim (1-138) has been shown to disrupt VimIF organization (Kural et al., 2007;Chang et al., 2009). Under these conditions, the VimIF network in transfected cells is withdrawn from the cellular periphery and reorganized into an aggregate at the cell center ( Figure 2A) (similar effects are seen in MFT-6 cells, not shown) (Kural et al., 2007;Chang et al., 2009;Mendez et al., 2010). Despite the fact that the microtubule system in these cells remains distributed throughout the cytoplasm ( Figure 2C), the distribution of mitochondria is altered as shown by the clustering of these organelles in the central region of the cells where the majority of the reorganized VimIFs are plectin alters the shape of mitochondria, but has no impact on their motility (Winter et al., 2008).",

In keratinocytes of patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex, caused by mutations in keratins 5 and 14, there is an abnormal distribution of mitochondria (Uttam et al., 1996), and in hepatocytes expressing mutant keratins 8 and 18 there is enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis due to abnormalities in mitochondria (Gilbert et al., 2001).

The coalignment of mitochondria with VimIF could be explained either by their direct interaction or simply because the distribution of both depends on transport along microtubules that have a radial pattern in this cell type (Gyoeva and Gelfand, 1991;Rodionov et al., 1993;Prahlad et al., 1998).",

We also assayed the motility of mitochondria in vimentin-null MFT-16 fibroblasts (see Materials and Methods; Holwell et al., 1997). The proportion of fast movements of mitochondria in these cells is twice the proportion of fast movements of mitochondria in normal (vim +/+ ) fibroblasts (9.0 \u00b1 0.5% and 4.0 \u00b1 0.3%, respectively) ( Figure 4B; see Materials and Methods). Furthermore, expression of VimIF in vim-null cells (depicted in Supplemental Figure S1B) slows the rate of mitochondrial motility to a value similar to that seen in normal fibroblasts (4.0 \u00b1 0.7%) ( Figure 4B; see Materials and Methods).

            "text": "We next sought to determine whether the inhibitory effect of VimIF on rates of mitochondrial movements is passive, acting merely to obstruct their motility, or whether it results from the binding of VimIFs to mitochondria. In the latter case, we should be able to alter mitochondrial motility by mutating the interacting vimentin domain. To test this possibility, we expressed wild-type or mutated vimentin in vimentin-null MFT-16 cells. The design of the mutant forms of vimentin focused on deletions in the non-\u03b1-helical N-terminal domain (depicted in Figure 5A). The rationale for this approach is based on findings that numerous N-terminal deletions of vimentin retain their ability to assemble into IFs in vitro and in vivo (Herrmann et al., 1992;Shoeman et al., 2002). Figure 5B shows that the recombinant proteins are of the expected sizes, and that their expression level is low compared with endogenous vimentin in control cells. Each of these mutant vimentins assembles into VimIF networks in vimentin-null cells (Supplemental Figure S1) which are indistinguishable from the VimIF networks in control cells (Supplemental Figure S1, A and B). Although these VimIF networks are distributed throughout the cytoplasm of transfected cells, they have different effects on mitochondrial motility. Specifically, the movement of mitochondria in cells expressing Vim \u039426-39 is similar to that of cells expressing wild-type vimentin ( Figure 5C). In contrast, following the expression of either Vim \u039441-96 or Vim \u039445-70 , mitochondrial motility is similar to that in null cells, suggesting that the mitochondrial interacting domain could reside between amino acids 45-70. This region meets the located ( Figure 2, B and D). In contrast, 3T3 cells expressing EGFPtagged wild-type vimentin contain normal VimIF networks and a normal distribution of mitochondria ( Figure 2, E and F; also see Yoon et al., 1998). These results show that the disruption of the VimIF network is accompanied by changes in the distribution and location of mitochondria, suggesting that mitochondria are tethered to VimIF. Further support for this interaction comes from cells expressing lower levels of EGFP-Vim (1-138) , in which we observe the partial disruption and fragmentation of VimIFs. In such cells, the localization of mitochondria remains largely unaltered, but they frequently lose their extended morphology and their orientations along VimIF (Figure 3). Interestingly, at this stage, the EGFP-Vim (1-138) itself frequently associates with mitochondria, suggesting that this fragment may contain a mitochondrial binding site. We next determined whether the reorganization of VimIFs toward the cell center induced by the expression of EGFP-Vim 1-138FIGURE 3: EGFP-Vim (1-138) localizes to mitochondria. Cells (3T3) were transfected with plasmid pEGFP-Vim (1-138) using FuGene 6 (Roche) and 24 h later were stained with MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Invitrogen; see Materials and Methods) (B) and then were fixed in methanol. (A) Epifluorescent image showing GFP localization. (C) Overlay of images in A and B. Bar, 10 \u03bcm. polymerization, as evidenced by the loss of inhibition following treatment with Latrunculin B (Lat B). To determine whether VimIFs modulate the association between mitochondria and F-actin, we examined the effects of LPA in vimentin-null cells. Following LPA treatment, the movements of mitochondria in normal fibroblasts are inhibited as previously described ( Figure 7A). In contrast, the movements of mitochondria in LPA-treated, vimentin-null cells are not altered ( Figure 7A). Furthermore, treatment with Lat B increases the motility of mitochondria in normal fibroblasts, but has no effect on the motility of mitochondria in vimentin-null cells ( Figure 7B). These data suggest that VimIFs anchor mitochondria and link them to F-actin.",

The presence of immobile organelles is probably explained by their anchoring at sites in the cytoplasm where a local supply of ATP is required. Our results show that VimIFs modulate mitochondrial movements in cultured cells. Our results also show that the slower movements of mitochondria in the presence of VimIFs is not simply attributable to a passive hindrance of their motility (Kural et al., 2007), but rather is due to specific interactions of mitochondria with these cytoskeletal structures. This conclusion is based on our results showing that several vimentin mutants with altered N-terminal domains do not affect the motility of mitochondria, despite their ability to polymerize into VimIF networks.",

In this study we show that plectin localizes to all of the mutant forms of vimentin (see, e.g., Supplemental Figure S2, D-F, showing colocalization of plectin antibody with Vim (P57R) -IFs and data in Gerashchenko et al., 2009). It is likely that plectin 1b binds to the mutant forms of vimentin used in this study as they all contain the known plectin binding site (Rezniczek et al., 2003). It appears therefore that direct interaction with vimentin is responsible for the inhibition of the mitochondrial movements. These data are further supported by the results of Winter and colleagues showing that plectin depletion does not alter mitochondrial motility (Winter et al., 2008).",

The proposed binding site meets the requirements for sequences targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane (Allen et al., 2002;Rapaport, 2003). Thus it is possible that the availability of this binding site at the surface of VimIFs explains their ability to requirements for sequences targeted to the outer mitochondrial membrane as it is moderately hydrophobic with two flanking regions containing positively charged amino acids (depicted in Figure 6A) (Rapaport, 2003); there is also a proline residue that has been shown to be required for the efficient targeting of some mitochondria-localized proteins (Allen et al., 2002). To determine whether proline is required for targeting to mitochondria, we transfected MFT-16 cells with vimentin P57R ( Figure 5A).

In support of this evidence, we recently demonstrated that the growth factor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), acting through the small GTPase RhoA and its effector mDia1, inhibits mitochondrial motility (Minin et al., 2006). This inhibition is dependent on actin This reasoning led us to propose that actin stress fibers are responsible for anchoring mitochondria at the cell periphery. Here we show that the disruption of F-actin by Lat B, or the induction of stress fibers by LPA, affects mitochondrial motility only in the presence of VimIFs. Thus, our results suggest that vimentin may act as an adaptor between mitochondria and actin microfilaments. We therefore propose that mitochondria are associated with VimIFs directly through binding to the vimentin N terminus and/or indirectly by means of plectin (Winter et al., 2008), whereas the interaction of VimIFs with F-actin structures is mediated by plectin (see Figure 8; Svitkina et al., 1996;Wiche, 1998).",

For live cell analysis of mitochondrial movements in transiently transfected cells, the expression level of recombinant vimentin variants was monitored by fluorescence microscopy of IFs labeled by coexpressed EGFP-or mCherry-fused vimentin forms as described (Yoon et al., 1998), using cotransfection of plasmids encoding unlabeled vimentin forms with plasmids encoding their EGFP-or mCherry-tagged variants. Only cells with dense IF meshwork were taken for further analysis (see examples in Supplemental Figure  S1). To obtain flat cells with better distributed mitochondria, sparse cultures were usually used. Sixteen to twenty hours posttransfection, 15 ng/ml MitoTrackerRed CMXRos or Deep Red FM (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium and the cells incubated for 30 min before this medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium.",

Plasmids pEGFP-Vim and pEGFP-Vim (1-138) , which encode EGFP-tagged human vimentin and its N-terminal polypeptide (1-138 amino acids), respectively, were described previously (Yoon et al., 1998;Kural et al., 2007). Plasmids encoding unlabeled human vimentin and mCherry-tagged wild type and mutated human vimentin were prepared by modification of the plasmid pEGFP-Vim using standard techniques. Plasmids encoding vimentin mutants retaining the ability to form IFs were made as described previously (Gerashchenko et al., 2009). Briefly, to make the plasmid encoding Vim \u0394(41-96) ( Figure 5A), an inverted PCR was performed using the plasmid encoding human vimentin as a template and the primers AAGAACACCCGCACCAACGAGA and CAGGCTGTAGGTGCGGGT. The resulting product was ligated by its blunt ends to make the deletion mutant. Similarly, the plasmids encoding Vim \u0394(26-39) and Vim \u0394(45-70) ( Figure 5A) were generated by using the primer pairs 1) GCTCGGCCGGCTCGCGGTGCCCGG and CTGGGCAGCGCGCTGCGCCCCAGCACCA, and 2) CAGCGCGCTGCCCAGGCTGTAGGT and CGGAGCAGCGTGC-CCGGGGT, respectively. The plasmid pVim (41-94) -Dendra2 encoding the fragment of the N-terminal domain of human vimentin tagged with fluorescent protein Dendra2 (Gurskaya et al., 2006) was prepared in two steps. First, we made the plasmid pVim (1-94) -Den-dra2 encoding the entire head domain of human vimentin fused to the N terminus of Dendra2. For that purpose PCR was performed using the primers TTTAAGCTTATGTCCACCAGGT and AAACCG-GTCCGGTGTTGATG, and the resulting product was inserted into vector pDendra2-N (Evrogene, Moscow, Russia) between HindIII-Age1 sites. Then, to obtain the plasmid-encoding shorter fragment FIGURE 8: Schematic representation of the association of VimIFs with mitochondria through vimentin N termini exposed on the filament surface and by means of plectin.
