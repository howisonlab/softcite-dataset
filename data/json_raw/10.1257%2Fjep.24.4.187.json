We used econphd.net's \"network rankings.\" Strengths of the econphd.net rankings include that 1) they are deep, covering nearly 500 employers, and 2) they include nonacademic employers. A weakness of the rankings is that they rank institutions, not economics departments. For any analysis we do that involves rankings, we consider only signals to economics departments in ranked institutions and to nonacademic employers who are ranked. We do not examine signals to noneconomics departments in ranked institutions because we think that the rankings are less accurate for such departments than for either economics departments or nonacademic employers.
