We used econphd.net's \"network rankings.\" Strengths of the econphd.net rankings include that 1) they are deep, covering nearly 500 employers, and 2) they include nonacademic employers. A weakness of the rankings is that they rank institutions, not economics departments. For any analysis we do that involves rankings, we consider only signals to economics departments in ranked institutions and to nonacademic employers who are ranked. We do not examine signals to noneconomics departments in ranked institutions because we think that the rankings are less accurate for such departments than for either economics departments or nonacademic employers. Specifi cally, Figure 1 includes signals to economics departments and to nonacademic employers, while  are being sent to departments of all ranks, including those ranked 400-500.

For this table, we consider only signals to economics departments, which we divide For this table, we consider only signals to economics departments, which we divide into tiers: tiers 1-4 are departments ranked 1-10, 11-50, 51-150, and 151-480, into tiers: tiers 1-4 are departments ranked 1-10, 11-50, 51-150, and 151-480, respectively. Economics departments not appearing in the rankings form a fi fth, respectively. Economics departments not appearing in the rankings form a fi fth, \"unranked\" category. There is a clear tendency for students from higher tiers to \"unranked\" category. There is a clear tendency for students from higher tiers to signal to departments in lower tiers. For example, from 2006-2009, 3,148 signals signal to departments in lower tiers. For example, from 2006-2009, 3,148 signals came from students in tiers 1 and 2 (see the top two rows of the far-right column), came from students in tiers 1 and 2 (see the top two rows of the far-right column), while just 1,426 signals went to those departments (see the fi rst two columns of the while just 1,426 signals went to those departments (see the fi rst two columns of the bottom row).

These characteristics include indicator variables for current graduate student, economics as primary fi eld, degree from a U.S. institution, tier of degree-granting institution (as defi ned inTable 2), and tier of employers signaled. Ratios for these variables in the survey sample and population were virtually identical.9 In the reported regression results, we use the applicant as the panel variable to address unobserved applicant quality. We also ran each regression using the employer as the panel variable and using a two-way clustered standard errors ordinary least squares model, fi nding similar results. Using applicant fi xed effects instead of random effects, and logit specifi cations rather than ordinary least squares, again produces similar results.",
