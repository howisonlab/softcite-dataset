The study prospectively recruited 96 consecutive patients with severe sepsis in a l intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Plasma Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-2, and VEGF levels and MODS were determined in patients on days 1, 3, and 7 of sepsis. Univariate and Cox proportional hazards analysis were performed to develop a prognostic model. Days 1, 3, and 7 plasma Ang-1 concentrations were persistently decreased in MODS patients than in non-MODS patients (day1: 4.0 AE 0.5 vs 8.0 AE 0.5 ng/mL, P < 0.0001; day 3, 3.2 AE 0.6 vs 7.3 AE 0.5 ng/mL, P < 0.0001, day 7, 2.8 AE 0.6 vs 10.4 AE 0.7 ng/mL, P < 0.0001). In patients with resolved MODS on day 7 of sepsis, Ang-1 levels were increased from day 1 (4.7 AE 0.6 ng/mL vs 9.1 AE 1.4 ng/mL, n \u00bc 43, P \u00bc 0.004). Plasma Ang-1 levels were lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors on days 1 (4.0 AE 0.5 vs 7.1 AE 0.5 ng/ mL, P < 0.0001), 3 (3.8 AE 0.6 vs 7.1 AE 0.5 ng/mL, P < 0.0001), and 7 (4.7 AE 0.7 vs 11.0 AE 0.8 ng/mL, P < 0.0001) of severe sepsis. In contrast, plasma Ang-2 levels were higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors only on day 1 (15.8 AE 2.0 vs 9.5 AE 1.2 ng/mL, P \u00bc 0.035). VEGF and Tie-2 levels were not associated with MODS and mortality. Ang-1 level less than the median value was the only independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio, 2.57; 95% CI 1.12-5.90, P \u00bc 0.025). Persistently decreased Ang-1 levels are associated with MODS and subsequently, mortality in patients with sepsis.

In addition to its function as vascular barrier, endothelial cells are implicated in inflammatory responses and coagulation imbalance in sepsis. 1 A study showed that endothelial injury is an independent predictor for MODS and mortality in patients with severe sepsis. The degree of endothelial injury correlates with the numbers of organ failure in those patients. 2 Taken together, sepsis-induced endothelial injury plays a critical role in mediating illness progression and outcome.",

            "text": "The angiopoietin (Ang) family contains 3 members in humans, including Ang-1, Ang-2, and Ang-4. 3,4 Both Ang-1 and Ang-2 bind to the same site of Tie2 receptor with similar affinity. 5 After binding to Tie-2 receptor, Ang-1 causes activation of Tie-2. In contrast, Ang-2 exerts antagonistic response to Tie-2. 6 Ang-1 inhibits the endothelial response to inflammatory cytokines and exerts protective effects. In addition, Ang-1 inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced bloodvessel formation and adhesion molecule expression, and attenuates increased VEGF and thrombin-induced permeability. 7,8 However, Ang-2 triggers inflammatory responses by activating the endothelial cell and increasing permeability. 9,10 Because of the important role of Angs in endothelial activation and vascular barrier breakdown, many studies have explored their role as biomarkers of sepsis. [11][12][13] Evidence has consistently shown increased Ang-2 levels in patients with sepsis compared with those without. But discrepancy exists in the levels of Ang-1 in patients with sepsis. Previous reports demonstrate that circulating Ang-1 levels remain unchanged, or even decrease, in septic patients. [11][12][13] Although decreased Ang-1 levels have recently been reported as an independent predictor for mortality in pediatric patients with severe bacterial infection, 13 few comprehensive clinical investigations have examined the role of circulating Ang-1 during the clinical course from MODS to subsequent mortality in sepsis. Whether longitudinally measured Ang-1 levels correlate with the resolution or aggravation of MODS during sepsis remains unclear.",

The functions of Ang-1 are to maintain vessel integrity, inhibit vascular leakage, suppress inflammatory gene expression, and prevent recruitment and transmigration of leukocytes. 17 The inadequate amount of Ang-1 in septic patients contributes to uncontrolled inflammation, injury of endothelial cells, and increased vascular permeability. 17 In fact, endothelial injury 2 and increased vascular permeability 18,19 have been documented as possible mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced organ failure and mortality. The failure to maintain quiescence status of endothelial cells due to inadequate Ang-1 during sepsis may play an important role in the development of organ failure and followed by mortality. Consistent with previous studies, this study demonstrates that day 1 plasma Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels are significantly different between nonsurvivors and survivors among patients with severe sepsis. Only Ang-1 level remains significant after multivariate analysis. 11,13 Nonetheless, other studies have not consistently shown a correlation between Ang-1 levels and mortality. A previous study showed that plasma Ang-1 levels were similar between surgical patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and those without. 20 Similarly, another study also failed to demonstrate a difference in plasma Ang-1 levels between survivors and nonsurvivors among mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock. 11 Discrepancies in the observed association between low Ang-1 levels and MODS and mortality in severe sepsis in the present study and in previous ones may relate to the difference in study populations and illness severity. In contrast to previous studies recruiting surgical patients complicated with ARDS or mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock, the present study recruited patients with sepsis complicated by organ dysfunction in an MICU.

These findings suggest that plasma Ang-1 level may serve as an early predictor of survival in septic patients. By serial measurement of Ang-1 levels, the persistent depressed Ang-1 levels may be used to identify the patients with persistent MODS and are vulnerable to mortality. In contrast, increased plasma Ang-1 on day 7 may indicate patients with resolved MODS. Our study results, if further confirmed by large-scale prospective studies, provided a useful marker to stratify the patients by measuring plasma Ang-1 levels. Therefore, serial measuring plasma Ang-1 in patients with severe sepsis should prompt efforts to identify and treat the modifiable factors associated with mortality. In patients with persistently decreased Ang-1 levels, some interventions may be instituted to improve survival. According to the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, 16 those interventions include: further studies performed promptly for confirming potential source of infection, reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data, a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS, and maintain tissue perfusion by targeting a hemoglobin of 7 to 9 g/dL. However, further studies are warranted to confirm the application of plasma Ang-1 monitoring on the management of patients with severe sepsis. Plasma Ang-1 levels negatively correlated well with organ failure status indicated by SOFA score and organ failure counts (Table 4). These findings further support the theory that inadequate amount of Ang-1 has a pathogenic role in sepsis and contributes to organ dysfunction, likely through endothelial activation and subsequent vascular leak, which could result in circulatory, hepatic, and renal compromise. These results are in agreement with previous clinical study reporting that plasma levels of Ang-1 are associated with organ failure in sepsis. 21 Indeed, an animal study had disclosed that administration of Ang-1 significantly protects against sepsis-associated organ dysfunctions and improves survival time, most likely by preserving endothelial barrier function. 22 Recently, platelets have been identified as carriers of angiogenic factors since a high amount of Ang-1 is found in platelets. 23,24 Results here demonstrate a positive correlation between Ang-1 level and platelet count. Moreover, the platelet counts of patients with plasma Ang-1 >median level is higher than those with Ang-1 level <median value. These findings suggest that sepsis-induced thrombocytopenia may contribute to the depressed levels of Ang-1 in patients with severe sepsis. Thrombocytopenia is typically a result of sepsis and mainly caused by sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 2 The presence of DIC is closely linked to sepsis-induced MODS and higher mortality rates. 25,26 The thrombocytopenia-associated depressed Ang-1 levels may play a certain role in the progression from sepsis-induced DIC to MODS and subsequent death.",

It is possible that patients who initially recovered from the septic insult may have died from another complication of critical illness. This would have an effect to decrease the power of Ang-1 to predict mortality in those patients with cause of death other than sepsis. However, our results that persistently decreased Ang-1 correlated with MODS course and mortality in patients with severe sepsis reinforces the use of Ang-1 as a predictive biomarker. Second, our study was performed in a single center. A larger study at multiple sites should be performed to confirm these findings.",
