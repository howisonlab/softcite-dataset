[Subjects and Methods] Pediatric cerebral palsy patients aged 3-15 years (n = 35/69) with 24-month follow-up at our outpatient cerebral palsy clinic were evaluated retrospectively. The distribution of cerebral palsy types was as follows: diplegia (n = 19), hemiplegia (n = 4), and quadriplegia (n = 12). Participants were divided into 3 groups according to their Gross Motor Functional Classification System scores (i.e., mild, moderate, and severe). All participants were evaluated initially and at the final assessment 2 years later. During this time, patients were treated 3 times/week. Changes in motor and functional abilities were assessed based on Gross Motor Function Measure-88 and Wee Functional Independence Measure. [Results] Significant improvements were observed in Gross Motor Function Measure-88 and Wee Functional Independence Measure results in all 35 patients at the end of 2 years. The Gross Motor Function Measure-88 scores correlated with Wee Functional Independence Measure Scores. Marked increases in motor and functional capabilities in mild and moderate cerebral palsy patients were observed in the subgroup assessments, but not in those with severe cerebral palsy. [Conclusion] Rehabilitation may greatly help mild and moderate cerebral palsy patients achieve their full potential.",

CP patients have static brain lesions and clinical manifestations that change over time during growth and development of the affected individual. The wide range of problems associated with CP poses difficulties in patient assessment and achieving rehabilitation targets 1,2) . Rehabilitation of CP requires a multidisciplinary approach. The family and team of specialists should establish the most appropriate approach after determining the treatment goal. Although there are several treatment modalities, scientific evidence regarding the basis for treatment decisions is limited. The heterogeneity of CP and the absence of controls and results of disease specific measures are responsible for the lack of evidence 1) .",

Individual evaluation of groups showed significant increases in both GMFM-88 and WeeFIM scores for mild and moderate groups. Yi et al. observed a marked improvement in gross motor function in 45 children with CP after 6 months of rehabilitation and attributed this improvement to a longer treatment duration, baseline GMFM-88 scores, and absence of a concomitant disorder. GMFM-88 scores were increased in both groups in this previous study, including diplegic and quadriplegic patients. A greater improvement was observed in diplegic patients compared to severely affected patients, albeit not statistically significant 19) . In contrast, a statistically significant change was not observed in GMFM-88 scores among our severely affected patients. Treatment was provided twice daily for 5 days/week in the study by Tae et al., which was different compared to our study.",

In our study, children with mild and moderate CP had higher post-treatment WeeFIM scores compared to baseline, which were consistent with their improved gross motor function, but there was no significant change in children with severe CP. In a study by Damiano and Abel, children with CP who achieved highest functional ambulation scores had higher GMFM-88 scores 23) . Beckung and Hagberg have stated that gross motor functions of children with CP are crucial for their physical independence and mobility 24) . The pre-treatment and posttreatment GMFM-88 and WeeFIM scores were determined to be correlated in a study involving children with CP after 1 year rehabilitation 25) . However, no correlation was found between GMFM-88 and WeeFIM scores of children with CP in a contrasting study 26) . Major limitations of our study included the fact that patients were treated at different centers and a small sample size. While a non-intensive (i.e., 3 times/week) rehabilitation program provided marked motor improvement and increased functional capacity at the end of 2 years in children with mild and moderate CP, which helped them reach their full potential, there was no such improvement in patients with severe CP. Our findings are comparable to several previous studies in this area. Identification and anticipation of problems experienced by children with severe disability would help patients and their families prepare better for the future.",
