Methods: In silico computational simulations were used to predict motifs within the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) as potential sites for p28 binding. In vitro direct and competitive pull-down studies as well as western blot and RT-PCR analyses were used to validate predictions. Results: The L1 loop (aa 112-124), a region within the S7-S8 loop (aa 214-236) and T140, P142, Q144, W146, R282 and L289 of the p53DBD were identified as potential sites for p28 binding. p28 decreased the level of the E3 ligase COP1 480%, in p53 wt and p53 mut cells with no decrease in COP1 in p53dom/neg or p53null cells. Brief increases in the expression of the E3 ligases, TOPORS, Pirh2 and HDM2 (human double minute 2) in p53 wt and p53 mut cells were in response to sustained increases in p53. Conclusion: These data identify the specific motifs within the DBD of p53 that bind p28 and suggest that p28 inhibition of COP1 binding results in the sustained, post-translational increase in p53 levels and subsequent inhibition of cancer cell growth independent of an HDM2 pathway.",

            "text": "The cupredoxin azurin preferentially enters a wide variety of cancer cells, inducing p53-mediated cytostatic and cytotoxic (apoptotic) effects in murine and human cancer cells (Yamada et al, 2002;Punj et al, 2004;Apiyo and Wittung-Stafshede, 2005;. Molecular modeling and atomic force microscopy studies suggest that azurin binds to the flexible L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops of the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD), forming a stable complex through tight protein-protein interactions (De Grandis et al, 2007;Taranta et al, 2008). Amino acids (aa) 50-67 (p18) and 50-77 (p28) of azurin represent the protein transport domain (Yamada et al, 2005;Taylor et al, 2009) and motif (Yamada et al, 2009) responsible for azurin's antiproliferative activity, respectively. Exposure of p53 wt MCF-7 breast cancer cells to p28 induces a post-translational increase in the level and activity of p53, inhibits the cell cycle at the G 2 -M transition and induces apoptosis, but not in the isogenic p53 dom/neg cell line MDD2 (Shaulian et al, 1992;Yamada et al, 2009). Intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by a series of ubiquitin E3 ligases that promote ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53 (Michael and Oren, 2003). The most prominent is HDM2 (human double minute 2) (Haupt et al, 1997). Current small-molecule HDM2 antagonists MI-219/AT-219, RITA, PXN727, Nutlins (cis-imidazoline analogues) and JNJ-26854165 (Cheok et al, 2011) bind to HDM2 and inhibit the subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of wild-type p53. Unlike these agents, p28 forms a complex (Bizzarri et al, 2011) within aa 80-276 of the p53DBD that decreases ubiquitination (Yamada et al, 2009) and proteasomal degradation of p53 via an HDM2-independent pathway (Yamada et al, 2009). In addition to HDM2, other E3 ligases, COP1 (constitutively photomorphogenic 1), Pirh2 (p53induced RING-H2 domain protein) and TOPORS (topoisomerase I binding, arginine/serine rich), also reportedly bind to p53 and negatively regulate intracellular levels of p53 (Leng et al, 2003;Dornan et al, 2004a;Dornan et al, 2004b;Rajendra et al, 2004;Dornan et al, 2006;Wang et al, 2011). COP1 is reportedly overexpressed in breast, ovarian and hepatocellular carcinomas, and gastric cancer (Li et al, 2012) predictive of survival in the latter (Dornan et al, 2004b), suggesting it contributes to the accelerated degradation of the p53 protein and attenuating the tumour suppressor function of p53 (Dornan et al, 2004b). Silencing COP1 inhibits tumour growth and suggests COP1 may be a promising target for systemic therapy (Lee et al, 2010).",

A COP1 deficiency also reportedly leads to c-Jun upregulation in human cancer cells (Migliorini et al, 2011), suggesting COP1 is also a tumour suppressor that functions, at least in part, by antagonising c-Jun oncogenic activity in the absence of a genetic interaction between COP1 and p53 (Migliorini et al, 2011). Here, we report the underlying mechanism for the post-translational increase in p53 wt,mut levels induced by p28 in breast cancer and melanoma cells. p28 inhibits the binding of COP1 to a specific motif of the p53DBD, leading to an autoreduction in COP1 levels (Dornan et al, 2006) and an increase in the level of p53 in the absence of any alteration in c-Jun.",

ClusPro (Kozakov et al, 2010) was used to conduct automated docking as a six-dimensional search within the rotational space between the two molecules. This generated a set of possible configurations for a predicted series of p53DBD-p28 complexes that were ranked based on scoring. The predicted complexes were then subjected to cluster analysis under a pairwise binding site root mean squared deviation criterion. The cluster model with the best score was used to further compare the proteinprotein interface using the ProtorP: Protein-Protein Interface Analysis Server (Reynolds et al, 2009).",

Molecular surface and electrostatic potential plots of the p53DBD were calculated by DeepView ver. 4.0.3 (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland) ( Figure 1B). A blue, red and white colour gradient represents positive, negative and neutral (including hydrophobic aa) potentials on the molecular surface, respectively. The DNAbinding surface of the p53DBD is highly cationic (blue). In contrast, the p28-binding area is essentially neutral (white), suggesting that electrostatic interaction may not have a role in p28 binding to p53 ( Figure 1B). The amino-acid composition of the predicted p28-binding sites on p53 was FLHSGTAVTCTYPA LTPQWEGSDCTHRL or 43% hydrophobic, 36% neutral and 21% hydrophilic residues. p28 bound to 10 of 13 aa (77%) in the L 1 loop that were 50% hydrophobic, 40% neutral and 10% hydrophilic residues and 7 of 23 aa (30%), 14% hydrophobic, 43% neutral and 43% hydrophilic, in the S 7 -S 8 loops ( Figure 1C). The four amino acids residing between residues 139 and 147 predicted to bind p28 are 50% hydrophobic and 50% neutral. These residues and the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops are not located at or near the DNA-binding surface of p53 (R248 and R273 are direct DNA-binding residues on p53), suggesting p28 does not interfere with the ability of p53 to bind to DNA ( Figure 1B). The ClusPro best score model also predicted that amino-acid residues LSTAAMQVVGDYLKDD of p28 bind to p53. Fifty per cent of the predicted residues are hydrophobic, again suggesting that hydrophobic rather than electrostatic interaction is essential to the formation of the p28-p53 complex ( Figure 1B). These results agree with computational docking (De Grandis et al, 2007) studies demonstrating that azurin binds to the L 1 and S 7 -S 8 loops of p53 through interaction of non-polar residues at the interface, creating a short-range hydrophobic interaction. A sequence map of the amino acids predicted to be involved in p28 binding and their relationship to the known binding sites of the E3 ubiquitin ligases that negatively regulate p53 is illustrated in Figure 1D. p28 does not bind to motifs shown to bind either HDM2 or Pirh2.",

Figure 3A shows that a 72-h exposure to p28 at 50 mmol l \u00c0 1 decreased the proliferation of (p53 wt ) Mel-29 and (p53 mut ) Mel-23, where p53 is internally deleted at aa 178-183 (Kichina et al, 2003), B25-30% from control. The inhibition was similar to that of 50 mmol l \u00c0 1 DTIC. Neither p28 nor DTIC altered the proliferation of p53 null Mel-6 cells. p28 also exhibited significant cytostatic activity on p53 wt MCF-7 breast cancer cells with a similar reduction (B20%) in the number of (p53 mut R280K) MDA-MB-231 cells after 72 h ( Figure 3B). These observations, in contrast, p28 did not exhibit an antiproliferative effect on MDD2 (p53 dom/neg ) or normal MCF-10A (p53 wt ) mammary cells confirming previous results (Yamada et al, 2009). Paclitaxel at 50 mmol l \u00c0 1 inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by B90% and MDD2 (p53 dom/neg ) and MCF-10 A (p53 wt ) cells by B50% and 35%, respectively ( Figure 3B). p28 also significantly decreased the weight of established p53 wt Mel-29 and p53 mut Mel-23 xenograft tumours in athymic mice ( Figure 3C). p28 did not inhibit cell growth of p53 null Mel-6 in vitro ( Figure 3A) or in vivo ( Figure 3C). p28 also decreased the weight of MCF-7 (p53 wt ) and MDA-MB-213 (p53 mut ) xenograft tumours by B50 and 60% respectively, similar to the effect of a non-toxic dose of paclitaxel (Mi et al, 2002) ( Figure 3D). The significant reduction in growth at 20 mg kg \u00c0 1 and lack of effect at 10 mg kg \u00c0 1 on MDA-MB-231 cells contrast sharply with the similarity in effect for either dose of p28 on p53 wt MCF-7, Mel-29 or p53 mut Mel-23 cells, suggesting the site of the mutation may be critical to overexpression of p53 ( Figures 4A and 5A) and to the overall effect of p28 on the proliferation of p53 mut cancer cells.",

            "text": "p28 Alters the level of p53 and major downstream targets. The significant decrease in growth following exposure to p28 was associated with a sustained increase in the level of p53 in p53 wt MCF-7 and p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 4A) and p53 wt Mel-29 and p53 mut Mel-23 cells ( Figure 5A) with no alteration in the level of transcription of p53 ( Figures 4B and 5B), confirming earlier results of an increase in p53 wt MCF-7 cells in response to p28 (Yamada et al, 2009). The increase in the level of p53 protein in these lines was also directly associated with an increase in the level of transcription and translation of p21. p28 did not alter either the level or rate of transcription of p53 or p21 in p53 dom/neg MDD2, p53 wt normal MCF-10A or p53 null Mel-6 cells ( Figures 4A  and B, and 5A and B). Forkhead box M1 protein (FoxM1), an important regulator of the G 2 -M transition, was significantly reduced in MCF-7, Mel-29 and Mel-23 cells during exposure to p28, increased in p53 dom/neg MDD2 cells at 48-72 h, and remained essentially unchanged in MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A and Mel-6 cells, suggesting that downregulation of FoxM1 also contributed to inhibition of the cell cycle in p53 wt MCF-7, Mel-29 and p53 mut Mel-23 cells. Although this may result from an inability of p53 mut to bind the p53 canonical consensus regions in the FOXM1 promoter, p21 levels were sufficiently elevated to inhibit the proliferation of p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells, despite the overexpression of FoxM1 ( Figure 4A) (Bektas et al, 2008). This is not surprising because p53 mutants can often transactivate promoters containing a p21 responsive element (Campomenosi et al, 2001) and loss of function in mutant p53 breast tumours does not represent a complete absence of activity (Williams et al, 1998). STMN1, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerisation (Belmont and Mitchison, 1996) and critical for cell cycle progression, was not significantly decreased in any cancer cell line tested ( Figures 4A  and 5A), suggesting p28 inhibition of the cell cycle at G 2 -M is at G 2 and does not involve inhibition of microtubule formation.",

Exposure of p53 wt MCF-7 and p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells to p28 reduced COP1 levels by B70% and 80%, respectively, over 24-72 h without altering the transcription of COP1 ( Figure 4A). Exposure of p53 wt Mel-29 to p28 significantly reduced COP1 levels (B75%) at 24 h that gradually increased (B60% of control) at 72 h ( Figure 5A). A similar effect on COP1 levels was observed in p53 mut Mel-23 cells. The lack of effect of p28 on COP1 levels in p53 null Mel-6 and delayed increase in p53 dom/neg MDD2 exposed to p28 suggest that the effects of p28 on COP1 are a function of a cell's p53 status.

However, exposure to p28 transiently increased the transcription and level of TOPORS (48 h) in p53 wt MCF-7 cells, but did not significantly affect either the transcription or level of TOPORS in p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 4A and  B). This suggests the upregulation of TOPORS by wild-type p53 was more efficient than with mutated p53. Exposure of p53 wt Mel-29 cells to p28 produced a sustained increase in the level of TOPORS that was not transcription dependent, whereas exposure of p53 mut Mel-23 cells to p28 reduced the level of TOPORS over 48 h, which was not preceded or accompanied by a change in transcription ( Figure 5 A and B). The increase in the level and transcription of TOPORS in p53 wt MCF-7 and Mel-29 cells and lack of effect on p53 mut MDA-MB-231 and Mel-23 cells suggest that changes in the level of TOPORS in response to p28 are dependent on p53 status and do not have a major role in the regulation of cell proliferation. p28 also induced a short-term (24 h) increase in the level of Pirh2 in p53 wt MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells without an accompanying increase in transcription, suggesting that the transient increase was in response to the p28-induced increase in p53 ( Figure 4A and B). In contrast, p28 had no significant effect on the expression of the Pirh2 protein or transcription in p53 wt Mel-29 or p53 mut Mel-23 cells ( Figure 5A and B). Collectively, changes in the level of TOPORS and Pirh2 appeared dependent on the cell line treated as well as p53 status and are a minor factor in the regulation of wild-type or mutated p53.",

If COP1 acts as a developmentally dependent tumour suppressor (Migliorini et al, 2011;Vitari et al, 2011), interacting with the oncoprotein c-Jun (Bianchi et al, 2003) to keep c-Jun at constitutively low levels in vivo and COP1 deficiency leads to c-Jun upregulation in human cancer cells (Migliorini et al, 2011) even in the absence of a genetic interaction between COP1 and p53 (Migliorini et al, 2011), then exposure to p28 should significantly increase c-Jun levels in p53 wt,mut,null cells. p28 did not significantly alter the level of c-Jun in either p53 wt MCF-7, MDD2 or MCF-10A cells and transiently (48 h) reduced (38%) c-Jun levels in p53 mut MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells ( Figure 6A). In contrast, c-Jun was significantly decreased over 48-72 h in p53 wt Mel-29 cells, briefly increased (48 h) in p53 mut Mel-23 cells, and only increased slightly over 24 h in p53 null Mel-6 cells ( Figure 6C). The decrease in c-Jun in p53 wt Mel-29 cells was accompanied by an increase in transcription (72 h), suggesting the increase was in response to the decrease in the level of the c-Jun protein ( Figure 6B and D) rather than the result of a decrease in COP1 following exposure to p28. None of these results suggest that a sustained decrease in COP1 results in an increase in the level and transcription of c-Jun (Migliorini et al, 2011). Moreover, the absence of any change in p53, COP1, p21, FOXM1, TORPORS, Pirh2 or HDM2 and the transient increase in c-Jun in p53 null Mel-6 cells in response to p28 suggest that the antiproliferative effects of p28 are mediated via the sustained increase in p53 and p21 independent of any effect on c-Jun (Migliorini et al, 2011).",

The loss of wild-type p53 function or gain of new oncogenic properties may result, in part, from the numerous missense point mutations within the DBD of p53 clustered into discrete hot spots (R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282) (Tu et al, 2008). However, the reported gain-of-function properties reportedly associated with p53 hot spot mutations may not be a universal phenomenon (Lee et al, 2012). Amino-acid residues R248 and R273 directly contact DNA while the remainder stabilises the structure of the DNA-binding motif within the DBD (Tu et al, 2008). In contrast, the flexible L 1 loop (aa 112-124) within the p53DBD is a mutational cold spot (Zupnick and Prives, 2006). Our models predicted that p28 would bind to the L 1 loop, a region of the S 7 -S 8 loop (aa 214-236) and T140, P142, Q144, W146, R282 and L289 of the p53DBD. This prediction was supported by GST pull-down assays (Figure 2A) and atomic force  spectroscopy studies that indicated p28 binds with high affinity to the p53DBD (Bizzarri et al, 2011). Once bound, p28 produces an increase in the level of p53 wt,mut ( Figures 4A and 5A), which is associated with an inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 3A-D). Neither the internal in frame deletion (aa 178-183) (Kichina et al, 2003) in p53 in Mel-23 cells, which does not include the predicted binding sites for p28, nor the point mutation at R280K in MDA-MB-231 cells that leads to overexpression (Olivier et al, 2002)  (Figure 4A) affects the binding of p28. This suggests that increasing an already elevated level of mutated p53 may also positively impact downstream targets within the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways (Ludwig et al, 1996;Campomenosi et al, 2001).",

Loss of FoxM1 leads to a delay in G 2 (Laoukili et al, 2005). p28 reduced the level of FoxM1 in p53 wt MCF-7, p53 wt Mel-29 and p53 mut Mel-23 cells and inhibited cell proliferation, but did not reduce the high basal levels of FoxM1 in triple negative (ER \u00c0 , PGR \u00c0 , HER2 \u00c0 ) p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 4A). The significant inverse correlation between FoxM1 expression and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) (Bektas et al, 2008) suggests overexpression of FoxM1 may result from this interaction or that the p53 mut R280K in MDA-MB-231 cells may not allow binding to the promoter region of FoxM1. However, p28 did increase the level of p21 in p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 4A), in turn inhibiting the activity of the cyclin-CDK2 complex (Yamada et al, 2009). This suggests that inhibition of CDK by p21 provided an alternative pathway for the reduction in growth in the absence of a reduction in FoxM1.",

            "text": "Intracellular levels of p53 are tightly regulated by a series of ubiquitin E3 ligases that promote ubiquitination and proteasomedependent degradation of p53 (Michael and Oren, 2003). HDM2 or MDM2 is the major E3 ligase promoting p53 degradation (Haupt et al, 1997;Kubbutat et al, 1997), but TOPORS, Pirh2 and particularly COP1 also bind to and negatively regulate p53 (Leng et al, 2003;Dornan et al, 2004b;Rajendra et al, 2004). Although TOPORS is expressed in most normal human tissues (Saleem et al, 2004), it is not expressed in colon cancer (Rajendra et al, 2004) and may not be an E3 ligase critical to p53 function in malignant cells. In contrast, Pirh2 expression is lower in normal compared with tumour cells and appears independent of the type of p53 mutation (Duan et al, 2006). The C-terminal domain of Pirh2 (aa 190-261) binds primarily to the tetramerisation domain (aa 325-355) of p53 (Sheng et al, 2008) well removed from the binding sites for p28. Exposure to p28 did not reduce Pirh2 levels in either breast cancer or melanoma cells (Figures 4 and 5), producing only short-term increases that were not accompanied by an increase in transcription. This suggests that only extant Pirh2 was recruited to degrade the increasing levels of p53.  p28 significantly increased the level and transcription of HDM2 in p53 wt MCF-7 cells over 24-72 h, while p53 levels remained elevated (Figure 4). The increase in HDM2 was minimal and delayed (72 h) in p53 mut MDA-MB-231 cells. p28 had essentially no effect on HDM2 levels or transcription in p53 wt Mel-29, and induced only a delayed increase in HDM2 protein and RNA levels in p53 mut Mel-23 cells in spite of a sustained increase in p53 levels in both cell lines.",

These motifs are distinct ( Figure 1D) from those binding HDM2. The significant reduction in COP1 levels in breast cancer and melanoma cells (Figures 4 and 5) is not accompanied by an increase in the transcription of COP1 message, indicating the loss in COP1 is through autodegradation (Dornan et al, 2006). The p28-induced reduction in COP1 levels was also not accompanied by a significant or sustained increase in the transcription in c-Jun levels (Migliorini et al, 2011) that would be expected if a decrease in COP1 levels led to upregulation of c-Jun or altered its ubiquitination. Similarly, overexpression of COP1 does not result in a decrease in steady-state levels of c-Jun nor reduce c-Jun half-life (Bianchi et al, 2003).",

The sustained decrease in COP1 levels induced by p28 did not result in a c-Jun-dependent increase in cell proliferation (Figure 3) (Migliorini et al, 2011), again suggesting that a pharmacologically induced reduction in COP1 levels does not result in a c-Junmediated increase in tumour cell proliferation in either p53 wt or p53 mut cancers (Migliorini et al, 2011).",

Increased levels of p53 upregulate the downstream molecules p21 (Figures 4A and 5A) and p27 (Yamada et al, 2009) in p53 wt and, at least some, p53 mut cancer cells, downregulating FoxM1, and leading to inhibition of cell cycle at G 2 -M.",
