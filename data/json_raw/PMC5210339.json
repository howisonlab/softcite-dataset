            "text": "Background-Although several risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified, early detection of AKI in acute decompensated heart failure patients remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk score for early prediction of AKI in acute decompensated heart failure patients. Methods and Results-A total of 676 consecutive acute decompensated heart failure participants were prospectively enrolled from 6 regional central hospitals. Data from 507 participants were analyzed. Participants from 4 of the 6 hospitals (n=321) were used to develop a risk score and conduct internal validation. External validation of the developed risk score was conducted in participants from the other 2 hospitals (n=186). Sequential logistic regression was used to develop and validate the risk score. The c statistic and calibration plot were used to assess the discrimination and calibration of the proposed risk score. The overall occurrence of AKI was 33.1% (168/507). The risk score, ranging from 0 to 55, demonstrated good discriminative power with an optimism-corrected c statistic of 0.859. Similar results were obtained from external validation with c statistic of 0.847 (95% CI 0.819-0.927). The risk score had good calibration with no apparent over-or under-prediction observed from calibration plots. Conclusions-The novel risk score is a simple and accurate tool that can help clinicians assess the risk of AKI in acute decompensated heart failure patients, which in turn helps them plan and initiate the most appropriate disease management for patients in time.",

            "text": "A cute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization. More than 30% of patients hospitalized for ADHF experience acute kidney injury (AKI), [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] which is independently associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. 9,10 The clinical importance of the coexistence of acute cardiac and renal dysfunction, known as acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), and its management have received great attention recently. [11][12][13] The poor prognosis of acute CRS makes the identification of patients at high risk especially important. However, early diagnosis of acute CRS has remained elusive due to restrictions on using serum creatinine or urine output for diagnosis of AKI. 14 The current diagnostic paradigm for AKI relies largely on biomarkers of renal function (serum creatinine and urine output) that have been in clinical use for over 50 years but are known to be insensitive and slow to change after kidney injury, often leading to a late and inaccurate diagnosis of AKI with resultant adverse outcomes. 9,10,14 Therefore, the current paradigm of AKI diagnosis needs to be reassessed in light of scientific advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of AKI facilitated in part by recent biomarker discovery programs. 15 Although it has been the goal of several studies to develop kidney injury biomarkers (such as neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin [NGAL] and urinary angiotensionogen [uAGT]) 13,[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] for early detection of AKI before occurrence of renal dysfunction, these studies have yielded varied performance. This suggests that a single biomarker (or single type of biomarkers) is not sufficient for the evaluation of clinical settings such as CRS. 15,17 Therefore, reformulating the predictive approach of AKI, ie, a multimarker approach, is more likely to be of greater use. 23 The major purpose of our study is to incorporate both clinical risk factors and the novel kidney injury biomarkers for such prediction that we can predict CRS early and improve the risk reclassification in this disorder. Precisely, we will develop and validate a risk score that can identify patients with either a very high or a very low probability of developing AKI using only baseline characteristics and effective urine biomarkers before a detectable change in serum creatinine in ADHF patients.",

Further, applying the risk score to all participants yielded a c statistic of 0.855 (95% CI 0.820-0.890), which was similar to that from the development cohort, suggesting high stability of the risk score. We also conducted sensitivity analysis to assess the single biomarker discriminative power by adding a single biomarker to the clinical model. The results are presented in Table S5. Briefly, the final risk model had the lowest AIC and highest c statistic in the development data set.

This restriction often leads to diagnostic delays and potential misclassification of actual injury status and provides little information regarding underlying cause. Actually, all successful therapeutic approaches in animal models used in patients have yielded disappointing results. 38 Major reasons are the scarcity of early biomarkers for AKI and consequent unacceptable delay in initiating treatment regimens. 15 AKI is a major contributor to poor patient outcomes. The International Society of Nephrology (ISN)'s 0by25 (zero preventable deaths by 2025) initiative aims to eliminate preventable deaths from AKI by 2025 by calling for global strategies that permit timely diagnosis and treatment of potentially reversible AKI. 39 As Mehta et al addressed in the Future Perspective Section, \"the effect of AKI on morbidity and mortality will be shaped by advances in methods to detect AKI earlier in the disease course.\" 39 Because early detection of AKI is helpful in identifying early kidney injury and preventing the progression of the kidney damage, our work may provide the first step forward to avoid harm to the kidney and devise early preventive strategies in CRS.",

Third, to develop a prediction tool for early detection of patients who would develop AKI during hospitalization, researchers should exclude those who already have AKI on admission. In our study we excluded those having AKI on admission based on preadmission measurements of serum creatinine, but we did not use this information in developing the risk score; thus, the use of the developed predicting tool is not limited by the need for preadmission serum creatinine.

As is the case in most AKI studies, we did not use urine output criteria (ie, <0.5 mL/kg per hour for >6 hours) for AKI diagnosis because urine output as the diagnostic criterion for AKI has been questioned recently for its limited sensitivity when diuretics are administered, reduced specificity in the presence of dehydration, and lack of practicality when an indwelling urinary catheter is not present (as in our setting). 15 Second, our findings remain to be confirmed by other independent studies. The question of whether the model predicts AKI in the special setting of ADHF versus AKI from other causes remains to be addressed. Third, although the study participants were recruited from 6 hospitals located in 5 cities in China, generalizability of the risk score to other populations still needs to be validated. In addition, the bootstrap procedure to estimate the overoptimism was conducted based on the developed risk score, which did not include the model selection step.

Continuous variables were divided into categories in terms of clinical significance except for NT-proBNP, for which the cut-off of 5578 pg/ml was chosen to yield good sensitivity and specificity. Mid-point value was defined as the reference value of each category. For the first and last categories of each variable, we used the 1 st and the 99 th percentiles to minimize the influence of extreme values. For each risk factor, the lowest risk category was chosen as the base category, and the distance of other categories from the base category was calculated as the difference of reference values between corresponding categories and base category multiplied by the regression coefficient of corresponding variable in the generated risk model. One point of the risk score system was defined as a constant of 0.141 which means the increase of risk associated with a 10-year increase in age, that is 0.0141\u00d710. The score of each base category was set at 0, and that of other categories were computed by dividing corresponding distance from the base category by the constant of 0.141 and then rounded to the nearest integer. The total risk score for an individual patient is obtained by summing up the score of each predictive variable. The predictive accuracy of the risk model and the risk score model was assessed by both discrimination measured by C-statistic (5) and calibration evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow \u03c7\u00b2 statistic (6) and calibration plot, a plot of observed proportions versus predicted probabilities.
