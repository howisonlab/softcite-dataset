            "text": "Compared to protein enzymes, our knowledge about how RNA accelerates chemical reactions is rather limited. The crystal structures of a ribozyme that catalyzes Diels-Alder reactions suggest a rich tertiary architecture responsible for catalysis. In this study, we systematically probe the relevance of crystallographically observed ground-state interactions for catalytic function using atomic mutagenesis in combination with various analytical techniques. The largest energetic contribution apparently arises from the precise shape complementarity between transition state and catalytic pocket: A single point mutant that folds correctly into the tertiary structure but lacks one H-bond that normally stabilizes the pocket is completely inactive. In the rate-limiting chemical step, the dienophile is furthermore activated by two weak H-bonds that contribute $7-8 kJ/mol to transition state stabilization, as indicated by the 25-fold slower reaction rates of deletion mutants. These H-bonds are also responsible for the tight binding of the Diels-Alder product by the ribozyme that causes product inhibition. For high catalytic activity, the ribozyme requires a fine-tuned balance between rigidity and flexibility that is determined by the combined action of one inter-strand H-bond and one magnesium ion. A sharp 360 turn reminiscent of the T-loop motif observed in tRNA is found to be important for catalytic function."

Our laboratory has previously reported the combinatorial selection of ribozymes that catalyze C-C bond formation by Diels-Alder reaction (5), an important reaction type in organic chemistry (7). The RNA molecules were selected to accelerate the cycloaddition reaction of an aromatic anthracene diene tethered to their 5 0 -ends (in cis reaction) with a biotinylated maleimide dienophile. The majority of the active sequences was found to contain a small secondary structure motif consisting of three helices (shown in cyan, yellow and green, Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1), an asymmetric internal loop, and the formally single-stranded 5 0 -end (shown in red), and a rationally re-designed 49-mer RNA containing these elements accelerated the in cis reaction about 20 000-fold. These ribozymes were later found to catalyze the cycloaddition reaction in a truly bimolecular fashion between dienes and dienophiles free in solution (in trans reaction). Other distinctive features are fast multiple-turnover catalysis and enantioselective bond formation (8).",

            "text": "A first insight into the principles of substrate recognition was obtained by studying the interactions of the ribozyme with a panel of systematically varied substrate analogs (9). These results suggested a major role for hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, while hydrogen bonding and metal-ion coordination appeared to be less important for catalysis. Mutation analysis and chemical probing identified interactions between nucleotides of the 5 0 -terminus and the internal asymmetric bubble, and indicated a preformed catalytic pocket (10). These findings could be confirmed by the solution of the crystal structure of this ribozyme in the unbound state and in complex with the Diels-Alder reaction product ( Figure  1b and c)  (11). The RNA was found to adopt a -shaped nested pseudoknot architecture, whose hydrophobic pocket shows precise shape complementarity (according to P1L21, P10L73, P11L9) to the reaction product (shown in dark blue). RNA folding and product binding are dictated by extensive stacking and hydrogen bonding, whereas stereoselection is governed by the shape of the catalytic pocket. The 5 0 -terminal tetranucleotide segment plays a critical role in shaping both the RNA scaffold and the catalytic pocket. All four residues align through Watson-Crick base pairing with residues on both sides of the asymmetric bubble segment (dotted black lines in Figure 1a), thereby forming the pseudoknot and zippering up the bubble (Figure 1b). The crystal structure suggests three hydrogen bonds between the ribozyme and the Diels-Alder product, involving amino and hydroxyl groups of the former and carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms of the latter (vide infra).",

Anthracene-HEG-GMP initiator nucleotides were incorporated at the 5 0 -terminus (5). Transcriptions were performed in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 22 mM MgCl 2 , 4-7 mM spermidine, 10 mM DTT, 2.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumine, 1 mM double-stranded DNA template, 1 mM initiator nucleotide A-HEG-GMP and 80 U T7-RNA polymerase. While most experiments were conducted with the wild-type sequence, investigation of the role of nucleotide G9 required (for incorporation of 2-aminopurine, purine and 2,6-diaminopurine riboside) the use of a G9A mutant transcription template, while inosine was incorporated using the wild-type template. The two resulting transcript libraries showed largely different reactivities in Diels-Alder reactions and required different conditions (see below). Concentrations of S P -aS-NTPs were adjusted according to the frequency of the respective nucleotide and the length of the ribozyme and had to be optimized for each analog. Transcription mixtures were ethanol precipitated and the re-dissolved pellets applied onto a C 18 -HPLC reversed phase column. Full length ribozyme conjugates were identified by their spectroscopic properties, isolated and 3 0 -end-labeled using 5 0 -32 P-pCp and T4 RNA ligase. The resulting Diels-Alderase-HEG-anthracene conjugate libraries containing modified nucleosides (final concentrations 100 nM) were subjected to Diels-Alder reaction with 5 mM biotin maleimide, and the reaction time was adjusted to achieve a library conversion (Cr) of 25-33% (2 min for the wild-type sequence, 30 min for the less reactive G9A mutant). After electrophoretic separation on 20% polyacrylamide gels, (unreacted) substrate and (reacted) product bands were quantified by phosphorimaging, excised, eluted and subjected to iodine cleavage in denaturing loading buffer (5.3 M urea, 34 mM EDTA pH 8.0) using 1/10 sample volume of ethanolic iodine solution (100 mM) for 3 min at room temperature and additionally for 1 min at 65 C. Cleavage patterns were analyzed by phosphorimaging of denaturing 20% PAGE sequencing gels (0.4 mm) using alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1 digest ladders for sequence assignments. Slight offsets of these reference lanes with respect to the phosphorothioate cleavage lanes are due to the different termini generated in the reactions. Analog interferences and phosphorothioate effects were identified by comparing the densities of substrate and product bands of individual positions, which were also used for quantitative data calculation. Product band densities D p were multiplied with the respective library conversion values C r (vide supra), while substrate band densities D s were multiplied by the factor (",

Lead probing detects both, specific metal ion coordination and general accessibility of the phosphodiester bonds (27). While the overall probing patterns are very similar (indicating similar overall structures), the lower half of the asymmetric bubble shows significant differences. Nucleotide A18 (the direct neighbor of U17) is completely protected from lead cleavage in the wild-type and U17C mutants, while it is efficiently cleaved in the isoC mutant (Figure 3c). While wild-type and U17C mutant are stabilized against cleavage by increasing Mg 2+ ion concentration, the probing pattern of the U17isoC mutant is not influenced by divalent cations. Another striking difference is the alteration of the probing patterns upon addition of Diels-Alder product (Supplementary Figure S5). In contrast to wild-type and U17C mutant, the U17isoC mutant exhibits no changes at all, indicating a strongly reduced affinity for the reaction product.",

According to our previous work, these conformations can be assigned to intermediate (I) and folded (F) states (12). For both constructs, the fractional population of the F state increases with the Mg 2+ ion concentration at the expense of the I state in a similar fashion with midpoints of 4.0 and 9.3 mM, respectively.

While X-ray crystallography showed that extensive stacking is an important principle of this ribozyme's structure formation (11), the atomic mutagenesis data presented here identify the extended cross-strand stack that runs through the whole molecule from the bottom of helix II through the catalytic pocket to the top of helix III (semi-transparent gray spheres in Figure 5a, for a stereo picture see Supplementary Figure S7) as arguably the single most important and most sensitive structural element. We call this element the 'spine', and it shapes and reinforces the overall architecture of the catalyst. The junction point of the cross-strand stack is located between nucleotides G9 and U17 (Figure 5b). Nucleotide G9 makes-according to the crystal structure-a number of non-standard interactions, one of them being a hydrogen bond proposed between its 2 0 -OH group and ring nitrogen HN3 of nucleotide U17 (11). This position is found to be sensitive to 2 0 -deoxy substitution (Table 1 and Figure 2a, k rel = 4%), and placement of two H-bond acceptors opposite each other completely abolishes catalytic activity (G9-2 0 OMeG versus U17C, k rel < 0.1%), thereby strongly supporting the importance of this particular interaction.",

In agreement with a critical role of this interaction, incorporation of isoC at position 17 in which the critical carbonyl oxygen O 2 is replaced by a NH 2 group yields a completely inactive ribozyme (k rel < 0.1%, Table 1, Figure 5d). A triple rescue experiment for this tertiary interaction is conceivable but not trivial, as the interacting nucleotides constitute the active site and make direct contacts with the substrates. The inactivity of the isosteric triple mutant U17isoC-C10isoC-G2isoG (k rel < 0.1%, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S4) is, therefore, not surprising.",

The possibility to disassemble the catalytic pocket by breaking a single hydrogen bond may be important for the multiple-turnover behavior of this catalyst (8,9), and also for the possibility of a 'back door' reaction pathway that requires substrate passage through a narrow orifice (29).

Neighboring nucleotides G7.4 and U8 form stacked base pairs; a standard Watson-Crick pair G7.4-C21.4 and a reverse Hoogsteen pair U8-A18, thereby formally extending helix II by one base pair. In a sharp turn of the counter-strand, the intervening nucleotides C19 and U20 are pushed outwards and rotated, allowing them to form-with their Watson-Crick faces-the lower pseudoknot minihelix that stacks upon helix I and forms the bottom of the catalytic pocket. Thus, while the first and the last member of this four-nucleotide stretch form one helix, the second and third one are involved in another one. While the phosphate backbone of the counter-strand makes only a $180 turn, bases A18 and C21.4 stack upon each other and enclose a full 360 segment (Figure 5f). The importance of the sharp turn is confirmed here by two findings: While a 2 0 -deoxy-substitution is tolerated well at nucleotide A18, incorporation of a 2 0 -OMe group causes a rather large reduction in activity (Figure 2, k rel $ 2.5%). Strikingly, the addition of a methyl group to carbon atom C5 of nucleotide U20 leads to inactivation of comparable magnitude ( Figure 2, k rel = 1%). These two phenomena seem to be connected: in the crystal structure, the 2 0 -O atom of A18 and C5 of U20 are only 3.3 \u00c5 apart and point (roughly) towards each other (see arrows in Figure 5f). Thus, the addition of a methyl group at either side of this hydrophobic compartment has a similarly detrimental effect.",

The removal of the N7 ring nitrogen (deazaA) or the exocyclic amino group (2-aminopurine, purine) lead to reduced activities in NAIM experiments.

The pocket is held together by an intricate hydrogen bonding network that looks like those seen in typical enzyme active sites. Conventional and atomic mutagenesis was used to probe the relevance of each interaction. The two Watson-Crick standard type interactions (gray dotted lines) are found important, but conservation levels differ. The bottom A-U pair tolerates pair-wise complementary substitutions (10), while for the roof G-C base pair the G2isoG (k rel = 8%) and the C10isoC exchanges (k rel = 0.8%) are the only mutations that do not completely abolish catalytic activity. This may be due to the different functions; the bottom apparently provides primarily a platform for diene stacking, while the roof has to interact with both substrates. Several non-standard interactions are found to be critically important for function (blue dotted lines), in particular those involving either junction nucleotide U17 or the reverse Hoogsteen pair U8-A18. Other interactions that are conceivable on the basis of the crystallographic information are found to be not essential for catalysis (red dotted lines). The hydrogen bond between ring nitrogen N3 of nucleotide A18 and the 2 0 -OH group of U20 is not essential, since the U20dU mutant shows high catalytic activity (Figure 2a), and the interaction between ring nitrogen HN1 of G9 and the 5 0 -phosphate group of A18 is also not critically important, as G9 mutants with an unprotonated N1 (purine and diaminopurine, Figures 2  and 3) are found to be active.",

While removal of the 2 0 -OH group of U17 causes only a 3-fold reduction in activity, destruction of the H-bond to the 2-NH 2 group of G9 by incorporation of inosine and purine results in a 5-to 8-fold decrease. The respective double mutants have residual activities of 4-5% of the wild-type, demonstrating an additive effect of the two interactions. This additivity suggests that the ribozyme combines the energy of two interactions of moderate strength to make a significant contribution to catalysis (33). The measured rates suggest that these two hydrogen bonds together contribute $7-8 kJ/mol to transition state stabilization. On the other hand, such a residual activity represents a $600-fold rate acceleration with respect to the uncatalyzed background (corresponding to a \u00c1\u00c1G # of $16 kJ/mol). Thus, the larger part of the energetic contribution comes from other interactions. The crystal structures indicated an excellent shape complementarity between the catalytic pocket and both, the Diels-Alder product and the transition state of the reaction. The magnitude of the equilibrium dissociation constant of the RNA-product complex (9,25) ($10 mM, corresponding to a \u00c1G of $30 kJ/mol) suggests that noncovalent interactions between the transition state and the catalytic pocket can easily provide the required amount of activation energy. Our finding that the point mutant U17isoC folds into the pseudoknot shape but cannot stabilize the appropriately shaped catalytic pocket and is completely inactive highlights the importance of shape complementarity.",

            "text": "Careful analysis of the structural features of the Diels-Alderase ribozyme revealed the presence of an important tertiary structure motif that is well known in a different context. The sharp 4 base-pair turn, with the bottom base pair being a Watson-Crick and the top base pair a reverse Hoogsteen, is known as the UA_handle which is, e.g. part of the T-loop signature found in tRNA (34). There, it directly interacts with the D-loop and thereby makes an essential contribution to the formation of the L-shaped tertiary structure. The nucleotides involved in its formation are among the most conserved ones in the whole tRNA structure, and the U54-A58 reverse Hoogsteen interaction was identified as one of the key structural aspects of tRNA functionality (35). The striking structural similarities between the respective sections of the Diels-Alderase ribozyme and tRNA Phe (from yeast, PDB Data set 1EHZ) are highlighted in Figure 7 (for more details, see Supplementary Figure S8). Several occurrences of this T-loop motif and the UA_handle submotif have also been reported in ribosomal and other large RNAs (34,36,37). Thus, rather than inventing a new structural solution for the problem of catalyzing a Diels-Alder reaction, in vitro evolution has recycled a motif that natural evolution has created a long time ago for completely different purposes, providing yet another example for the modular character of RNA architecture (38)(39)(40).",

In that study, a different set of substrates (6-furfuryl-adenine as diene and maleic anhydride as dienophile) was used. The authors concluded from pressure-dependent lead probing and CD spectroscopy that high pressure disrupts the T-loop-D-loop interaction, and proposed that this opened tRNA forms a scaffold to which the diene is docked by stacking interaction. Considering the structural parallels with the Diels-Alderase ribozyme, this suggestion appears conceivable, as the left half of the catalytic center would already be in place. The adenine part of the diene substrate could furthermore be sandwiched between the G57 (yellow) and reverse Hoogsteen A58 (blue) in the space that is normally occupied by G18 from the D-loop, thereby placing the furfuryl ring roughly at the same position (relative to the T-loop motif) as the anthracene ring system in the Diels-Alderase ribozyme. How the dienophile substrate is positioned and how the catalytic site is formed remains unclear, however.",

The roles of several individual hydrogen bonds and of four magnesium ions for the stability and catalytic function of the ribozyme could be unraveled. The critical importance of the central hydrogen bonding network was established by experimental data. Moreover, new insight was obtained regarding the mechanistic role of hydrogen bonds between catalyst and substrates, and the integrity of the catalytic pocket. The loss of a single H-bond on the surface of the catalytic pocket leads to complete inactivation. The base triplet G2-C10-U17 and, in particular, the acceptor-donor pair 2O-U17 versus 4NH 2 -C10, are of extraordinary importance for the formation of the active fold. A sharp 360 turn reminiscent of the T-loop motif observed in tRNA is found to be crucially important for catalytic function, although its precise role is not clear yet. Future work will address some of the open questions regarding the structure and mechanism of this ribozyme, such as the order of substrate binding and the role of conformational changes during the catalytic cycle, and the molecular details about how this ribozymes folds into its nested pseudoknot tertiary architecture."
