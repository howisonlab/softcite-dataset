            "text": "BACKGROUND: Mesothelin is expressed in various types of malignant tumour, and we recently reported that expression of mesothelin was related to an unfavourable patient outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In this study, we examined the clinicopathological significance of the mesothelin expression in gastric cancer, especially in terms of its association with the staining pattern. METHODS: Tissue specimens from 110 gastric cancer patients were immunohistochemically examined. The staining proportion and intensity of mesothelin expression in tumour cells were analysed, and the localisation of mesothelin was classified into luminal membrane and/or cytoplasmic expression. RESULTS: Mesothelin was positive in 49 cases, and the incidence of mesothelin expression was correlated with lymph-node metastasis. Furthermore, luminal membrane staining of mesothelin was identified in 16 cases, and the incidence of luminal membrane expression was also correlated with pT factor, pStage, lymphatic permeation, blood vessel permeation, recurrence, and poor patient outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was an independent predictor of overall patient survival. CONCLUSION: We described that the luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was a reliable prognostic factor in gastric cancer, suggesting the functional significance of membrane-localised mesothelin in the aggressive behaviour of gastric cancer cells."

            "text": "Mesothelin is a 40-kDa cell surface glycoprotein and is expressed on normal mesothelial cells lining the pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum (Chang et al, 1992;Chang and Pastan, 1996). Moreover, mesothelin is overexpressed in various types of malignant tumour, including malignant mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer (Argani et al, 2001;Ordonez, 2003a, b;Hassan et al, 2005a;Einama et al, 2011). The full length of human mesothelin gene codes the primary product being a 71-kDa precursor protein. It can be physiologically cleaved by some furinlike proteases into a 40-kDa C-terminal fragment that remains membrane bound, and a 31-kDa N-terminal fragment, which is secreted into the blood (Chang and Pastan, 1996). The C-terminal 40-kDa fragment is named mesothelin and is attached to the cell membrane through a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Chang and Pastan, 1996;Hassan et al, 2004).",

In ovarian cancers, diffuse mesothelin staining correlated significantly with prolonged survival in patients who had advanced-stage disease (Yen et al, 2006), and another report indicated that a higher mesothelin expression is associated with chemoresistance and shorter patient survival (Cheng et al, 2009). In pancreatic cancer, mesothelin expression was immunohistochemically observed in all cases, while its absence was noted in non-cancerous pancreatic ductal epithelium, with or without pancreatitis (Argani et al, 2001;Swierczynski et al, 2004;Hassan et al, 2005b;Einama et al, 2011). Furthermore, we recently explored that the expression of mesothelin was related to an unfavourable patient outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, in gastric cancer, which is one of the representative gastrointestinal cancers, mesothelin expression seems to correlate with prolonged patient survival (Baba et al, 2011); this is a paradoxical result for the other types of carcinomas. In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical analysis of mesothelin in 110 primary gastric cancers, especially focussing in the localisation of mesothelin, that is, luminal membrane and/or cytoplasm, and its clinicopathological significance associated with patient's outcome.",

Furthermore, among the 'mesothelin-positive' cases, the staining localisation of mesothelin was evaluated as luminal membrane and/or cytoplasm. In cases in which the entire circumference of the luminal membrane was explicitly stained even in partial throughout the section, 'luminal membrane positive' was given. When the luminal membrane was stained discontinuously and/or faintly, or in cases in which no membrane staining and only cytoplasmic staining was observed in any intensity level throughout the section, 'luminal membrane negative' was given ( Figure 1; Supplementary  Figure 1). Meanwhile, the mesothelin cytoplasmic expression was evaluated as follows: in a case in which the cytoplasmic staining was clearly observed in the constituent cancer cells, including the cytoplasmic granular staining, we judged it as 'cytoplasmic positive' (Figure 1).",

To confirm the mesothelin expression as an independent prognostic factor, we performed the univariate analysis of the 110 gastric cancers using the Cox proportional hazards model, and obtained the result that pT factor, pN factor, clinical stage, lymphatic permeation, blood vessel invasion, and mesothelin luminal membrane expression were significantly correlated with the risk of cancer death (Table 2). Furthermore, to exclude the possible interference of any other factors, the multivariate analysis was performed including pT factor, pN factor, clinical stage, lymphatic permeation, blood vessel invasion, and mesothelin luminal membrane expression. Interestingly, the luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was an independent predictor of overall survival for gastric cancer patients as well as clinical stage and lymphatic permeation (Table 3).",

Interestingly, the incidence of luminal membrane positive including expression in both membrane and cytoplasm was increased in metastatic lymph nodes (51.4%; 18 out of 35) compared with primary lesions (31.4%; 11 out of 35). Moreover, in 4 cases out of 14 mesothelin-negative cases in primary lesion, luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was observed. These results support our idea that luminal membrane expression of mesothelin is associated with the malignant behaviour of tumour cells.",

The univariate analysis indicated that the luminal membrane expression of mesothelin was also correlated with lymph-node metastasis, clinical stage, lymphatic permeation, blood vessel invasion, residual tumour, and recurrence, although a luminal membrane expression of mesothelin remained a statistically independent factor for favourable patient outcome after the multivariate analysis. Our result that total mesothelin expression including the case of exclusive cytoplasmic expression did not correlate with patients' prognosis will explain the discrepant previous report in which mesothelin expression correlates with prolonged patient survival in gastric cancer (Baba et al, 2011). We therefore emphasise that membrane-localised mesothelin might have an important role in the development of gastric cancer. The full length of human mesothelin gene codes the primary product being a 71-kDa precursor protein. It can be  Figure 3 Overall survival for patients with gastric cancer after surgical therapy stratified by the status of mesothelin expression (A), mesothelin luminal membrane expression (B), and mesothelin cytoplasmic expression (C), respectively.

The C-terminal 40-kDa fragment is referred to as mesothelin, which is attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor (Chang and Pastan, 1996;Hassan et al, 2004). The 5B2 antimesothelin antibody (Novocastra Laboratory Vision BioSystems, Boston, MA, USA), which we employed here for IHC, can detect the 71-kDa precursor protein and also the 40-kDa C-terminal fragment (Inami et al, 2008); therefore, we could not decide which form of mesothelin has a pivotal role in malignant behaviour of gastric cancer cells. Recent studies reported that mesothelin is not only associated with increased cell proliferation and with the migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro (Bharadwaj et al, 2008;, but also contributes to tumour progression in vivo . Mesothelin inhibits paclitaxel-induced apoptosis through concomitant activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signalling in the regulation of Bcl-2 family expression (Chang et al, 2009), and induces the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) 3, which leads to increased expression of cyclin E and makes pancreatic cancer cells proliferate faster (Bharadwaj et al, 2008). In addition, mesothelin-activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) induces elevated interleukin (IL)-6 expression, which acts as a growth factor to support pancreatic cancer cell survival/proliferation through a novel auto/paracrine IL-6/soluble IL-6R trans-signalling (Bharadwaj et al, 2011a, b). Our study provided a new aspect that luminal membrane expression of mesothelin is associated with the malignant behaviour of tumour cells, such as depth of tumour invasion and vascular invasion, although it remains necessary to clarify the biological function of the 71-kDa mesothelin precursor and/or 40-kDa mesothelin protein in in-vitro and in-vivo studies, including the processing system by furin-like proteases.",
