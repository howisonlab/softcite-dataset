TBI is an example of a medical condition where there are still major lacks in diagnostics and outcome prediction. Here we apply comprehensive metabolic profiling of serum samples from TBI patients and controls in two independent cohorts. The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n = 22), moderate (moTBI; n = 14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n = 108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n = 28) comprised of acute orthopedic non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n = 23), moTBI (n = 7), mTBI (n = 37) patients and controls (n = 27). We show that two medium-chain fatty acids (decanoic and octanoic acids) and sugar derivatives including 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also detected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients. Based on metabolite concentrations from TBI patients at the time of hospitalization, an algorithm was developed that accurately predicted the patient outcomes (AUC = 0.84 in validation cohort). Addition of the metabolites to the established clinical model (CRASH), comprising clinical and computed tomography data, significantly improved prediction of patient outcomes. The identified 'TBI metabotype' in serum, that may be indicative of disrupted blood-brain barrier, of protective physiological response and altered metabolism due to head trauma, offers a new avenue for the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers of broad spectrum of TBIs.",

            "text": "TBI is associated with a complex metabolic disruption that results in energy crisis and energy failure, which is the consequence of multiple mechanisms, including classical ischaemia (Coles et al., 2004), diffusion hypoxia (Menon et al., 2004), mitochondrial dysfunction (Lakshmanan et al., 2010) and increased energy needs (from excitotoxicity, seizure activity and spreading depolarization) (Timofeev et al., 2011). Thus far, the only approaches to examine this metabolic dysregulation have involved the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain microdialysis, arteriojugular venous differences, or advanced metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRIS), none of which are universally available, and are particularly problematic in less severe TBI. Since metabolic dysregulation is such a fundamental facet of TBI pathophysiology, these metabolic changes may contain prognostic information, and early changes may provide a useful summary of the pre-hospital and early hospital physiological insults experienced by the brain. The broad assumption has been that these metabolic changes are the consequence of metabolic failurebut there is the possibility that some may be causes as well as consequences of the pathophysiology observed. In addition, release of brain specific metabolites (i.e. small molecules with molecular mass under 500 Da) into the systemic circulation may provide information on blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, a fundamental process in TBI (Saw et al., 2014).",

            "text": "Several peptide or protein based biomarkers for TBI have been proposed. These include S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), neuronspecific enolase, myelin basic protein, creatine kinase brain isoenzyme, glial fibrilary acidic protein, plasma DNA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 (Berger et al., 2006;Ingebrigtsen and Romner, 2002;Mondello et al., 2011;Papa et al., 2010;Pelinka et al., 2004;Vos et al., 2004). However, most of these biomarkers lack the disease specificity. For example, protein S100B, the most extensively studied biomarker of TBI, has been reported to be released into the serum also after experimental ischemic injury to the liver, kidney, and the gut (Pelinka et al., 2004). Moreover, its levels have been found to have increased also after exercise (Koh and Lee, 2014), extracranial trauma (Savola et al., 2004) and burns (Anderson et al., 2001) and it has also been suggested as a biomarker of melanoma (Torabian and Kashani-Sabet, 2005).",

The linear retention indices were calculated based on the total (i.e., sum of the first and the second dimension) retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The second dimension retention time is so short (1-3.5 s) that its contribution to the retention index is not significant. The alignment of the data was performed based on retention indices, second dimension retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC \u00d7 GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria was utilized for positive identification: spectral similarity N850 and maximum allowed difference in retention index between experimental and literature values b25. Only the metabolites detected in over 70% of the samples in each of the four study groups were included in the dataset. This procedure resulted in a total of 465 metabolites.

In addition, Golm metabolome database (Kopka et al., 2005) was used for further identification of the metabolites.

Although the propofol and related metabolites were removed from the dataset and the long-chain FAs were not upregulated in the patients with propofol administration, we examined in more detail the potential association of propofol with the observed changes in mediumchain FA levels. However, the two significantly upregulated FAs (OA and DA) were significantly upregulated also in the severe patients (n = 8) who had not been receiving propofol prior to the first sample being taken (4.2 and 3.6-fold, p = 0.001 and p = 0.012 for OA and DA, respectively).

Medium-chain fatty acids readily penetrate the BBB (Oldendorf, 1973) and there is evidence that FAs can be transported in both directions through the BBB (Spector, 1988). A recent study of free fatty acids in plasma and brain, following intravenous human mesenchymal stem cells transplantation into rats that had undergone transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, showed upregulation of several FAs in both blood and brain, including OA, whereas the levels of long-chain FAs were significantly reduced (Paik et al., 2009). Mitochondria play a crucial role in the pathophysiology and energy crisis associated with the brain injury. OA and DA provoke mitochondrial dysfunction by acting as uncouplers and metabolic inhibitors of the oxidative phosphorylation (Schuck et al., 2009b). Several studies have also shown that DA and OA play a role in brain energy metabolism (Ebert et al., 2003) and elicit lipid and protein oxidative damage (Green and Reed, 1998;Reis de Assis et al., 2004;Schuck et al., 2009a).",

First, blood concentrations of 2,3-BPG are dominated by the concentration of this metabolite in red blood cells (RBCs), where it acts as an allosteric modulator of oxygen affinity (Hsia, 1998) and is produced through the effect of BPG mutase on 1,3-BPG (a glycolytic intermediate). It is therefore likely that plasma levels may be influenced by the dominant effects of RBC 2,3-BPG, but the relationship between the levels of this metabolite in the two compartments is unclear. Second, levels of 2,3-BPG in RBCs are modulated by physiological influences, including anemia, hypoxia and changes in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), all of which are common in TBI. These factors make it difficult to identify the drivers of changes in serum 2,3-BPG, but may explain why the metabolite had no prognostic relevance.",

The indole derivative IPA, a deamination product of tryptophan formed by gut microbiota (Wikoff et al., 2009), was downregulated in severe as well as mild TBI patients. IPA has been shown to prevent oxidative stress and death of primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells exposed to the amyloid beta-protein (Chyan et al., 1999). IPA also shows a strong level of neuroprotection in two other paradigms of oxidative stress (Hwang et al., 2009;Karbownik et al., 2001). Our findings thus suggest an intriguing possibility that specific circulating metabolites are transported to the injured brain in order to maintain normal brain metabolism.",

The difference in the cohort mean ages likely weakens the total accuracy of the predictive outcome model. However, the added value of two among the top ranking metabolites from Turku cohort significantly augmented the performance of clinical multivariate model (CRASH) including age in Cambridge cohort.

In order to develop a diagnostic assay based on the biomarker panel identified in our study, the metabolites will also have to be absolutely quantified and then assayed in larger TBI and control populations.

Our findings also suggest that these metabolites may exhibit diagnostic potential in the full spectrum of TBI.
