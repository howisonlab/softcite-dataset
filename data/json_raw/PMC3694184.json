The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte production observed in the mice. Hence, this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, emerged in the late 1980s in the United States and Europe [24]. It quickly spread worldwide and became enzootic among pig populations in most countries [24]. The virus strongly modulates host immune responses and changes host gene expression patterns. PRRSV inhibits the production of key cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 [2,3], and may induce the expression of regulatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-10 [20]. Moreover, the appearance of neutralizing antibodies is delayed in pigs infected with PRRSV [4,16,23] and these animals are more prone to develop concomitant infectious diseases [10,19]. Data from these and other studies indicate that PRRSV causes immunosuppression in the affected pigs [5,15]. Therefore, strengthening the host defense mechanisms may be important for controlling PRRSV infection. Germanium biotite (GB) is an aluminosilicate mineral that contains 36 ppm germanium. This compound possesses a number of biological activities that are beneficial for animal health, especially immune function and host defense. A previous study reported that GB enhances the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in mouse spleen lymphocyte [11]. Continuous ingestion of the mineral also increases phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced cytokine expression and enhances antibody production in mice in a dose-dependent manner [9]. Moreover, dietary supplementation with GB expedites the clearance of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in experimentally infected pigs [9] as well as bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1) clearance from experimentally infected calves [12]. These findings suggest that GB as a feed supplement can potentially protect against respiratory viral diseases through the potent stimulation of non-specific immune responses. However, the underlying immunological mechanisms remain unclear and anti-PRRSV effects of the mineral have not yet been",

In sections of lung, the presence and severity of type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, alveolar septal infiltration by inflammatory cells, peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia, volume of alveolar exudate, and degree of inflammation in the lamina propria of the bronchi and bronchioles were scored on a scale ranging from 0\u223c6 (0, normal; 1, mild and multifocal; 2, mild and diffuse; 3, moderate and multifocal; 4, moderate and diffuse; 5, severe and multifocal; or 6, severe and diffuse). Sections of lymphoid tissues were evaluated for lymphoid depletion using a scale ranging from 0\u223c3 (0, normal; 1, mild lymphoid depletion with loss of overall cellularity; 2, moderate lymphoid depletion; and 3, severe lymphoid depletion with loss of lymphoid follicular structure) and the presence of inflammation with a scale ranging from 0\u223c3 (0, normal; 1, mild histiocytic-to-granulomatous inflammation; 2, moderate histiocytic-to-granulomatous inflammation; and 3, severe histiocytic-to-granulomatous inflammation with replacement of follicles). Scores representing the microscopic lesion severity in sections of lymphoid tissues were calculated as the sum of the individual scores for both parameters.

            "text": "In the present study, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced ConA (T-cell mitogen)-induced lymphocyte proliferation in mice. This finding was consistent with data from our previous study showing that GB markedly increases the ability of PHA (a T-cell mitogen) to induce cytokine expression in mice [9]. Furthermore, the CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased in the spleens of mice fed GB compared to those of the control group. In contrast, the CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte ratio did not vary between the groups in the present study. These results imply that dietary GB supplementation enhances immune responses and the proliferation of T lymphocytes, especially CD3+CD8+ cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that aluminosilicate, the main component of GB, acts as a non-specific immunostimulant similar to superantigens [1,22], a class of extremely potent T cell mitogens [21]. It is also well known that germanium activates T lymphocytes, especially cytotoxic T cells [6]. Collectively, observations from the present study and data from the literature indicate that dietary supplementation with GB mainly affects CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In the current investigation, dietary supplementation with GB alleviated high fever in pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV throughout the experimental period. Moreover, the viral titer for lungs from the GB-fed group was significantly decreased at 12 DPI compared to that for the control group; however, viral titers for both groups were under the limit of detection at 28 DPI. Similar trends were also observed in all tested lymphoid tissues. Histopathological analysis also revealed that GB supplementation resulted in less severe abnormal changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group. These results imply that dietary supplementation with GB promotes PRRSV clearance in experimentally infected pigs. This is consistent with findings from our previous studies showing that GB enhances the clearance of respiratory viruses such as PCV2 and BHV1 in experimentally infected pigs and calves [9,12]. It is generally accepted that CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes inhibit the replication of intracellular pathogens like viruses by secreting soluble mediators that interfere with pathogen replication and/or induce the death of infected cells [17]. Therefore, the antiviral activities of GB may be related to the CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte stimulatory effects observed in the mice. In summary, findings from the present investigation suggest that dietary supplementation with GB primarily stimulates CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation in mice and expedites the clearance of PRRSV in experimentally infected pigs. Hence, GB may serve as a feed supplement that promotes immune activity and helps prevent disease. However, the effects of GB on immune responses in swine were not assessed in the present study. Additionally, the exact mechanisms underlying virus clearance promoted by GB were not identified. Further experiments need to be performed to understand effects of GB on immune responses and virus clearance in pigs. PRRSV clearance following GB administration should also be measured in pigs with naturally occurring cases of PRRS.",

At 12 DPI, the viral titer of lung (LUN) tissues from the 0.3% GB-fed pigs was significantly decreased compared that for the control group (*p \uff1c 0.05). Moreover, viral titers of lymphoid tissues including bronchial lymph node (BLN), tonsil (TON), and thymus (THY) were significantly decreased in the 0.3% GB-fed animals compared to the control group (*p \uff1c 0.05). Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).",

Pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI (based on lung histopathological features) compared to the control animals (A). Additionally, lymphoid depletion was less severe in the 0.3% GB-fed group, and clearer separation between the cortex and medulla of the thymus (D) compared to the control group (C) was observed. Lung (LUN) microscopic lesion scores for pigs fed 0.3% GB were significantly decrease compared to those for the control group (*p \uff1c 0.05). Moreover, microscopic lesion scores for the lymphoid tissues [bronchial lymph node (BLN), tonsil (TON), and thymus (THY)] from the 0.3% GB-fed group were lower than those for the control group although this difference was not significant. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcm. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).",
