The situation was exceptional in a sense, that during the period of the financial crisis the Polish interbank market experienced liquidity surplus, and the main problem of the central bank was to regain confidence among commercial banks and stimulate interbank transactions. We concentrate on the spread between the rate of overnight interbank loans and the reference rate and based upon its dynamics we assess the monetary policy of the Polish central bank. Using econometric techniques we study how the central bank influenced the spread, when its control over it weakened and when was it strengthened. The study is supported by the results of the survey directed to the headquarters of commercial banks. We conclude that the ability of the central bank to control overnight rate was The views in this paper should be regarded as those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect those of the National Bank of Poland.",

The Polish interbank market is special in a sense that liquidity surplus has been present there even since 1994 (National Bank of Poland 2009). However, together with the outbreak of the financial crisis, the confidence in the Polish interbank market declined drastically. Commercial banks preferred to accumulate liquidity surplus and performed almost no interbank transactions of maturity longer than 7 days. Banks preferred to keep their surplus on their current accounts with the central bank or in the form of deposit facility, and they significantly limited participation in the 7-day open market operations conducted by the National Bank of Poland (NBP) (National Bank of Poland 2009). The latter resulted in the so called underbidding (i.e. the situation during the tenders for the NBP bills, when the banks' total bid is lower than the supply offered by the central bank). As a consequence, the effectiveness of the central bank in stabilization of the market rates, what is one of the main goals of the monetary policy, diminished significantly.",

            "text": "Our goal was to assess the effectiveness of the monetary policy of the Polish central bank, using econometric methods, as well as with respect to the results of the survey, sent to the head-quarters of the Polish commercial banks. The problem of assessing the effectiveness of the stabilization policy of central banks using econometric methods is also rather new in literature. Panigirtzoglou et al. (2000) studied the effectiveness of controlling the interbank rates through the key interest rates of the central banks of Great Britain, Italy and Germany using ARMA-GARCH models. Vila Wetherilt (2003) studied the impact of the changes of the main refinancing operation rates of the Bank of England on the market interest rates. Nautz and Offermanns (2007) and Hassler and Nautz (2008) analyzed the effectiveness of the European Central Bank investigating long memory of the spread between EONIA and the MRO rate. There are also papers in which the authors investigate the impact of particular factors on the spread, among others: demand-supply ratio of central bank bills, balance of the overnight deposit and credit in central bank, dummies indicating end of the period during which commercial banks are obliged to maintain their required reserve level-see egg. Moschitz (2004), Ejerskov et al. (2003), Wuertz (2003), Linzert and Schmidt (2008), Abbassi and Nautz (2010). Beirne (2011) and Beirne et al. (2010) show that during the subprime crisis the European Central Bank lost some of its control over the overnight interest rate. The analogous research for the Polish banking sector was performed by Kliber and Pluciennik (2011a) as well as by Kliber et al. (2011), as well as Lu (2012). This article is the continuation and extension of the previous studies. First of all, we analyze the spread between the POLONIA rate and the reference rate in shorter periods which allows us to follow the changes of the effectiveness of the stabilization policy of the National Bank of Poland. We trace also the impact of several factors which seemed to lower the ability of the central bank to stabilize the POLONIA rate. The period of study is longer and covers the years: 2006-2012. The study is supported by the survey sent to the biggest commercial banks in Poland.",

Apart from the basic open market operations, the NBP provided also the standing facilities, allowing commercial banks to manage short-term liquidity using the marginal lending facility (lombard credit). Yet another instrument of the central bank's monetary policy is the required reserve system. It is used to stabilize liquidity and reduce the short-term interest rates volatility. The commercial banks are obliged to maintain their required reserves with the central bank either on current accounts or on required reserve accounts (National Bank of Poland 2009).",

In the situation of the confidence crisis, the banks' demand for liquidity grew significantly. First of all, they were reluctant to invest their money for longer than overnight, and thus the long-term operations were limited (not only in the interbank market, but also with the central bank). According to National Bank of Poland (2009), at the beginning of the reserve maintenance periods, banks strived to hold even more of their assets than required on current account at the National Bank of Poland. Thus, they complied at an earlier stage with the reserve requirement. This phenomenon is called frontloading and was typical not only for the Polish market. Since the funds held with the NBP above the required level are not remunerated, the excess funds were placed with the central bank using standing deposit facility. In such circumstances it became difficult to forecast liquidity properly. Therefore, starting from October, 17, 2008 National Bank of Poland stopped publishing the supply of the weekly bills, in order not to allow for such a situation, when the supply could exceed the demand. Up to the late February 2009 the NBP supported the main refinancing instruments in the amount needed by the commercial banks (so calledperiod of passive liquidity management).",

As a result, the central bank decided to increase the amount of bills available on tenders and the demand and supply again matched.

This is the period during which the first signals of the crisis were observed, the debt of the US citizens grew and first financial institutions collapsed. During this period POLONIA was not officially announced as the key interest rate of the National Bank of Poland, however some spread characteristics suggest that POLONIA had been stabilized since the beginning of 2006 (see also: Kliber and P\u0142uciennik 2011a). In the first subperiod the spread took small positive values. Such values are typical in the situation when the commercial banks, lending their assets to other banks, take into account the risk premium (see: Wuertz 2003;Hassler and Nautz 2008 observe an increase of the POLONIA volatility. However, it does not seem to follow directly any of the mentioned events. As we mentioned previously, the confidence decline in the interbank market was a gradual process, and a consequence of the global confidence crisis. \u2022 Period III (05.09.2008III (05.09. -19.02.2009. In this period the financial crisis became a fact. On September, 15th, the Lehman Brothers collapsed. The confidence crisis gained its peak. In October the National Bank of Poland implemented the Confidence Package. Starting from October, 17, the NBP decided not to limit the supply of its bills during weekly auctions, but supply them in the amount covering the full demand. This was the beginning of the period of the so called ''passive monetary policy'' or ''passive liquidity management''. In the third period increase of POLONIA volatility is much more visible, and connected with the aforementioned underbidding. POLONIA rate used to take much lower values than the reference rate, and at the end of the maintenance periods its values were closer to the deposit rate. Due to frontloading, the price of overnight money declined and the spread widened (see: National Bank of Poland 2009). \u2022 Period IV (20.02.2009IV (20.02. -27.05.2009. Starting from February, 20, the NBP returned to the active liquidity management and again started to limit the supply of its bills during weekly auctions. As a consequence, commercial banks artificially increased their demand for bills. Since it was impossible for banks to invest all the money in the secure NBP papers, supply of the overnight money increased and the POLONIA rate decreased, taking values close to the deposit rate. (28.05.2009-23.04.2010). This was the period of the relative stability of the financial markets all over the world. In the Polish interbank market, however, the situation was not yet stable (high underbidding in November and December). Yet, at the beginning of 2010 the liquidity situation in the interbank market started to improve (National Bank of Poland 2010). At the beginning of the fifth period the absolute values of the spread increased again, as a result of the underbidding. This phenomenon is explained by the willingness of the banks to demonstrate their high liquidity level in the half-year balance-sheets. Such situation repeated also in July and August 2009. It was a consequence of the rapid liquidity growth in the banking sector. The banking sector again experienced an increase in the level of short-term liquidity, caused by the purchase of foreign currency by the NBP and from exchange of foreign currency to the Polish zloty (carried by the Ministry of Finance at the NBP)-see: National Bank of Poland (2011b). Moreover, from December 2008 to December 2009 the level of currency in circulation decreased by 1,470 million PLN. Commutation of these factors resulted in lowering the POLONIA rate to the deposit rate level. \u2022 Period VI (24.04.2010-13.06.2011). This was the period during which the Greek problems became apparent to the whole Europe (first aid packages, and change of bond ratings to junk level). When it comes to the Polish interbank market, the improvement observed in the first half of 2010 was discontinued. The underbidding was much more frequent, since the banks instead of placing the surplus in the 7-days NBP bills, kept the liquidity buffer in their own accounts.",

From June 2011 the fine-tuning operations introduced in December 2010 were supplemented by fine-tuning operations at the end of the maintenance period, with the overnight maturity. Fine-tuning operations of this type enabled banks to balance their own liquidity position over the entire reserve maintenance period (National Bank of Poland 2011a).

We observe also that the skewness was negative in all the periods, apart from the fourth (when the NBP returned to the active liquidity management) and fifth one (a period of relative stability in the financial markets).",

The rate is quoted by 14 banks (so called money market dealers, selected by the NBP), every business day, at 11 am. The average of the quotation is the WIBOR rate. The banks are obliged to enter the transactions at the WIBOR rate for a short period of time after the quotation. In this sense the WIBOR rate is the transactional one (for more details see-ACI Polska webpage). 5  Linzert and Schmidt (2008), in order to explain the dynamics of EONIA spread, used a variable bid-tocover ratio which is defined as the ratio between the total bid volume of monetary bills and the amount covered. It is interpreted as a degree to which the liquidity surplus is absorbed by the central bank. The part of the surplus not absorbed by the central can be invested in the interbank market, which affects the money supply in the interbank market and in turn influences the interbank rates levels. Therefore, we expect a positive relationship between the spread and the bid-to-cover ratio. However, as explained in (Kliber and P\u0142uciennik 2011a), the idea of Linzert and Schmidt (2008) proves correct under the assumption that the underbidding does not occur in the monetary bills auction. Underbidding causes a decrease in the spread, but when it occurs the value of bid-to-cover ratio is the highest. Therefore, similarly to (Kliber and P\u0142uciennik 2011a) we decided to introduce the two variables: btcratio and ctbratio. \u2022 df_lf-difference between the balance of the end-of-the day deposit to the balance of lombard credit; represents the surplus of supply over demand for money in overnight; \u2022 binary variables indicating:",

It is worth noting that the variable 1wois_ref was positive in the whole period. This suggests that the investors expected future growth of the short rate. Therefore, we conclude that the investors believed also that POLONIA would come closer to the reference rate and thus, that it would stabilize.

Explanation of this phenomenon can be as follows: due to liquidity surplus and reluctance of the banks to lend for longer periods, the supply of overnight money exceeded the demand. In such situation POLONIA comes close to deposit rate, and the commercial banks prefer to invest their surplus in the interbank market. However, during the confidence crisis lots of banks were unable to allocate their money in the interbank market. Thus, they placed their surplus as the end-ofthe-day deposit with the central bank, diminishing the supply of the money. As a result POLONIA rose. Again, when it was much higher than the deposit rate (5-10 basis points), it made the end-of-the-day deposit more attractive to commercial banks. The period of the cycle was however longer than a day, and thus, we observe the negative autocorrelations of POLONIA, as well as the opposite sign of parameters at the lagged explanatory variables.",

The negative value of the parameter obtained in the model is thus justified.

Counterintuitive, in the first two sub-periods the relationship between btctatio and the spread was negative, and became positive only starting from the fifth sub-period. The negative relationship found in the first sub-periods can be explained again by underbidding, the occurrence of which suggested the loss of control over POLONIA by the NBP. The banks were reluctant to obtain the bonds and lose their liquidity for the whole week, but instead invested only in the overnight instruments. Together with the end of the confidence crisis (the ending sub-periods) the relationship became positive, as expected (see also: Linzert and Schmidt 2008). In the case of the model for conditional mean, the variable ctbratio was significant only in the seventh period and the sign of the coefficient was negative (which is consistent with our expectations).

We observe that the variables: btcratio and its lagged value, the day of the main operation as well as the variable connected with the difference between the supply and the demand for the overnight money: df_lf significantly influenced the spread. However, as we already noticed, the relationship between the spread and btcratio was in this period negative. The fact can be explained by the very large difference between the supply and the demand for the NBP bills, resulting in underbidding. Commercial banks artificially increased their demand, and since it could not have been fulfilled, the surplus must have been invested in the interbank market. In consequence, the supply of the ''short money'' was higher than the demand for it and POLONIA went lower (see also Fig. 1). In the case of levels and volatility, we observe also significant impact of periodicity-through the variables indicating end of year, end of half year, the day of the main operation (conditional mean equation) as well as the end of reserve maintenance period (both conditional mean and variance). Volatility of the spread was also affected by the variable ctbratio.",

The positive long memory parameter suggests that the National Bank was unable to manage the POLONIA rate. High persistence of the spread and the longlasting impact of shocks makes it difficult for the short rate to perform its signaling role (see also: Nautz and Scheithauer 2011). In the presence of long memory, the effect of shock was persistent and the National Bank of Poland was unable to contradict them. In the opposite case, the effect of shock disappeared shortly afterwards, and the central bank was able to control the short rate. The impact of expectations and the uncertainty associated with the overnight rate were significant. Significance of uncertainty can be explained by the fact that that when the central bank returned to active liquidity management, the bank reacted very nervously (and declared excessively high demand for NBP bills). Thus, the central bank had to rise the supply and the situation stabilized already in the next-fifth period. Indeed, we observe a significant impact of all variables that influenced POLONIA in the first periods. However, the uncertainty associated with the overnight rate was still present (the lagged variable var_1wois). This uncertainty disappeared already in the sixth period. In the both sub-periods we notice significant impact of underbidding (the variable underbid) on the dynamics of POLONIA, and at the same time the relationship between the variable btcratio and the spread was positive.",

In assessing the NBP policy we took into account two criteria: the results of the survey sent to commercial banks, as well as the results of the econometric study on the ability of the bank to steer POLONIA rate. The situation in the Polish interbank market was exceptional-contrary to the western European case, the Polish market was experiencing liquidity surplus. However, together with the financial crisis, there came the confidence breakdown. Thus, Polish commercial banks for security reasons stopped interbank transactions of maturity longer than 7 days and decided to accumulate liquidity surplus. In order to improve the situation, the National Bank of Poland decided to implement so called Confidence Package. Moreover, following the Central Bank, the Monetary Policy Council decided to run a series of interest rate cuts, as well as lowered the level of required reserve. From October 2008 to February 2009 the NBP managed liquidity passively. At the same time, the central bank tried to effectively manage its key rate: POLONIA.",

They appreciated the interest rates cut, although viewed them as too sharp and too fast. Most of the banks appreciated lowering the level of required reserves, as well as the fine-tuning operations at the end of the reserve maintenance period. Most of them also quite positively assessed the ability of the central bank to stabilize POLONIA, but the majority noticed no difference of the effectiveness of the NBP policy between the periods 2008-2009 and 2010-2011. Yet, based upon the presented research we conclude that together with the outbreak of the financial crisis, the central bank gradually lost its ability to stabilize POLONIA rate. Commercial banks not only maintained significant liquidity surpluses on their current accounts, but at the same time they aimed to fulfill the reserve requirements prior to the deadline (frontloading). Underbidding, often observed during tenders, indicated inability of the central bank to sterilize the liquidity surplus (introducing money bills with maturity shorter than 1 week also did not bring the expected results). Supply of the overnight money was higher than demand for it, and thus POLONIA rate declined and almost reached the level of the deposit rate (at that   6.1 9 10 -6",

Together with the stabilization in the international market, the central bank regained its ability to effectively manage POLONIA. The study suggests significant impact of the Confidence Package on the stabilization in the market. However, it seems that the Greek debt crisis again intensified the nervousness among commercial banks. Introduction of fine-tuning operations at the end of reserve maintenance period (commercial banks obtained additional possibility to place the liquidity surplus in the central bank) helped to stabilize the situation in the market, although the liquidity surplus was still present.

During this period the markets experienced sharp decline of confidence. Lots of commercial banks applied for and received financial help in huge amounts (from Federal Reserves System, European Central Bank, etc.). The confidence crisis spread to Europe, however, it had not yet been perceived in Poland.
