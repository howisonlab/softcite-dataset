            "text": "The salient feature of liquid crystal elastomers and networks is strong coupling between orientational order and mechanical strain. Orientational order can be changed by a wide variety of stimuli, including the presence of moisture. Changes in the orientation of constituents give rise to stresses and strains, which result in changes in sample shape. We have utilized this effect to build soft cellulose-based motor driven by humidity. The motor consists of a circular loop of cellulose film, which passes over two wheels. When humid air is present near one of the wheels on one side of the film, with drier air elsewhere, rotation of the wheels results. As the wheels rotate, the humid film dries. The motor runs so long as the difference in humidity is maintained. Our cellulose liquid crystal motor thus extracts mechanical work from a difference in humidity."

At higher concentrations, the hydrophobic hydroxypropyl groups promote the association of polymer chains to form rigid rod-like fragments 3 .

The molecules are packed into crystallites ,470 \u00c5 long and ,34 \u00c5 diameter 4 . These micro-fibrils, in turn, associate to form supermolecular rod-like fragments, resulting in a network of rigid rod-like fragments joined together by flexible polymer linkages.

Physical properties, such as the density, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, are functions of Q ab . In a uniaxial system, the order parameter may be written as Q ab~S 1 2 n a n b {d ab \u00c0 \u00c1 , where { 1 2 \u0192S\u01921 is a scalar order parameter, andn is the nematic director, a unit vector along the direction of average alignment. Elastomers are rubber-like solids characterized by an elastic modulus on the order of MPa which can accommodate strains .100%. In 1975, P.G. de Gennes proposed the concept of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), cross-linked polymer networks with orientationally ordered mesogenic units 7 . LCE materials were synthesized and samples produced for the first time by H. Finkelmann 8 . The key aspect of these new 'solid' liquid crystals is coupling between mechanical strain, e ab and orientational order, Q ab . Due to the symmetry allowed scalar Q ab e ba which appears in the free energy, an applied strain will change orientational order, similarly to an applied electric field, and all physical properties which depend on it. More importantly for the work reported here, any change in orientational order will result in mechanical strain, similar to that resulting from external stress, causing a change in the shape of the elastomer sample. Due to their unusual behavior, LCEs have received considerable attention, their salient features are discussed in detail in Refs. 9,10. Changes in the order parameter caused by heating, illumination, exposure to electric fields or the presence of chemical solvents give rise to corresponding changes in sample shape [11][12][13][14] . The mesogenic units may be incorporated into the polymer main chain, or they can be attached via side-chains. In main chain LCEs, the increase of nematic order leads to an increase in sample length along the director, and a contraction in the two perpendicular directions. A decrease in order has the converse effect.",

In preparing samples, solutions are initially on a glass substrate, with a free surface exposed to air. When the cellulose concentration is sufficiently high for the formation of the liquid crystal phase, the mesogenic fragments can be uniformly aligned in the sample by shear. Shear is applied via a calibrated Gardner knife moving at a controlled speed of 1.25 mm s 21 on the free surface, as shown in Fig. 1b.; the process produces a monodomain nematic sample. As indicated by X-ray studies 19 , the director aligns along the shear direction. As evaporation continues, the density of rod-like fragments increases near the free top surface, giving rise to increased orientational order. This in turn causes elongation at the top of the film in the direction parallel to the director, and since the dimensions of the bottom surface in contact with the glass substrate are fixed, the top surface buckles, forming a set of grooves 20 . This can also be seen in Fig. 1c. The final film thickness is ,40 mm microns. The grooves, whose wave vector is along the shear direction, are ,3 mm apart, with amplitude ,45 nm. The structure of the film near the glass surface is less well understood. Here, the solvent remains during shear, so less alignment is expected. The films, removed from the substrate, are large area, free-standing flexible macroscopic samples.",

            "text": "Our humidity driven motor is shown below. A monodomain nematic HPC film was produced in the form of a circular loop, 8.0 cm long, and 1.0 cm wide (Fig. 5). The alignment direction is in the plane of the film, perpendicular to the long edges. The loop was passed over two 14 mm diameter wheels with horizontal axes. When humid air was applied to the outer side of the film near one of the wheels, as shown in Fig. 5, the wheels began to rotate, and continued so long as humid air was present. The motion is caused by humidityinduced bend of the liquid crystalline HPC film. A heuristic explanation for the motion is as follows. If the tension in the film is assumed to be nearly uniform, the humidity induced bend shortens the lever arm on the side where the moist air is applied, resulting on a net torque on the wheel and causing rotation of the wheel as illustrated schematically in Fig. 6. We have estimated the tensile stress from the shape of the circular film loop to be 357 Pa, which is close to the shear stress produced by humidity. We conjecture that these two quantities need to be comparable for the engine to operate efficiently.",

If the relative humidities are 30% and 70%, as in our experiments, the amount of energy available for work at room temperature is 2.1 KJ/mole of water, or approximately 100 J/g. The underlying mechanism is similar to that of the collagen engine of Katchalsky 23 , which is driven by the chemical potential difference of  NaCl in saline solutions and pure water. Whereas his collagen fibers contracted in the presence of salt, our LCN bends in the presence of humidity. Since our steam engine runs isothermally, it differs fundamentally from conventional steam engines in that it is not a heat engine. We call it therefore a steam engine of the second kind, and note that, consequently, its efficiency not limited by that of Carnot cycles. It appears, from Eq. (1), that considerable energy is available for work from reservoirs of high and low humidity; our engine provides a new method of obtaining work from a humidity difference.",

            "text": "In summary, we have demonstrated a new type of soft motor, using a cellulose liquid crystal film, driven by a difference in humidity. The motor is simple; it relies on the moisture-induced bend of the HPC, which arises from the coupling between the orientation order of the rigid rod-like fragments of the network and mechanical strain. Changes in orientational order are caused by the absorption of water molecules. As the engine rotates, the moist film dries in a dry air environment, and returns to its original shape, ready to perform work again when exposed to moist humidity. Since the transport of water is via directed diffusion along concentration gradients, it is expected that smaller motors will run faster. Micromotors operating on this principle, using the chemical potential of liquid water or moist air may be useful in reducing humidity or producing mechanical or electrical energy. Further studies are needed to determine the efficiency of the energy conversion process in such a steam engine of the second kind."

The lever arms (green) are of equal length, and the net torque on the top wheel due to tension in the film is zero. (b) Due to the humidity-induced bend, the configuration is no longer symmetric. Lever arm on the right in top wheel is shorter; net torque on top wheel due to tension in the film gives rise to CW rotation.
