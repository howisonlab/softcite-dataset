            "text": "Multiple angiogenic cues modulate phosphotyrosine signaling to promote vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Despite its functional and clinical importance, how vascular cells integrate phosphotyrosine-dependent signaling to elicit cytoskeletal changes required for endothelial morphogenesis remains poorly understood. The family of Nck adaptors couples phosphotyrosine signals with actin dynamics and therefore is well positioned to orchestrate cellular processes required in vascular formation and remodeling. Culture of endothelial cells in three-dimensional collagen matrices in the presence of VEGF stimulation was combined with molecular genetics, optical imaging, and biochemistry to show that Nck-dependent actin remodeling promotes endothelial cell elongation and proper organization of VE-cadherin intercellular junctions. Major morphogenetic defects caused by abrogation of Nck signaling included loss of endothelial apical-basal polarity and impaired lumenization. Time-lapse imaging using a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer biosensor, immunostaining with phosphospecific antibodies, and GST pull-down assays showed that Nck determines spatiotemporal patterns of Cdc42/aPKC activation during endothelial morphogenesis. Our results demonstrate that Nck acts as an important hub integrating angiogenic cues with cytoskeletal changes that enable endothelial apical-basal polarization and lumen formation. These findings point to Nck as an emergent target for effective antiangiogenic therapy.",

Vascular morphogenesis is orchestrated by multiple angiogenic cues that elicit a coordinated response of endothelial cells, including proliferation, transitions in polarity states, directional migration, matrix remodeling, and lumenization (Adams and Alitalo, 2007; Iruela-Arispe and Davis, 2009;Davis et al., 2011). Cytoskeletal remodeling-in particular, actin dynamics-plays a key role in the regulation of vascular morphogenesis and homeostasis (Lamalice et al., 2007;Bayless and Johnson, 2011). Cytoskeletal remodeling also underlies the aberrant endothelial response leading to pathological angiogenesis and vascular destabilization induced by an imbalance in angiogenic cues (Weis and Cheresh, 2011).",

Phosphorylation sites resulting from activation of tyrosine kinases provide a platform for the assembly of signaling complexes through the recruitment of adaptor and scaffold proteins containing phosphotyrosine-binding modules (Machida and Mayer, 2005). The family of noncatalytic regions of tyrosine kinase (Nck adaptor proteins; hereafter Nck), consisting of Nck1/\u03b1 and Nck2/\u03b2, links tyrosine phosphorylation with downstream effectors that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics (Li et al., 2001;Buday et al., 2002). These modular adaptors, composed of three N-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domains and one C-terminal SH2 domain, are required for the development of mesoderm-derived embryonic structures (Bladt et al., 2003), including the cardiovascular system (Clouthier et al., 2015). We and others have shown that Nck plays an important cells formed large tubes with well-defined lumens (Figure 2,A and B,left). In contrast, Nck-silenced cells exhibited a more-rounded appearance and far-less-extended cell-cell junctions, with inclusion of large cytoplasmic vacuoles and endocytic vesicles (Figure 2,A and B,right,and C). Typically, hollow structures formed by Nck-silenced cells showed intracellular or intercellular lumens of decreased diameter ( Figure 2C). Western blot analysis performed on cell extracts collected from 3D cultures showed a decrease in Nck levels in the silenced group ( Figure 2D). Collectively these results point to an essential role of Nck adaptors in endothelial tubulogenesis.",

The phenotype exhibited by Nck-silenced endothelial cells in the present study (Figures 1 and 2) prompted us to investigate the role of Nck in the distribution of VE-cadherin and the organization of endothelial adherens junctions. First, we hypothesized that Nck is enriched at VE-cadherin cell-cell junctions. Because commercially available anti-Nck antibodies are not suitable for immunofluorescence, we resorted to expression of fluorescently tagged Nck. Thus we prepared monolayers of endothelial cells expressing Nck-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and performed immunostaining of endogenous VE-cadherin and/or cortactin, an Nck binding partner and regulator of junctional actin assembly (Han et al., 2014). Consistent with observations in epithelial monolayers (Han et al., 2014), endogenous cortactin colocalized with junctional VE-cadherin (Supplemental Figure S2A, top). In support of our hypothesis, Nck-EYFP accumulated at VE-cadherin/cortactin-rich cell-cell junctions (Supplemental Figure S2, A and B).",

To test this hypothesis, serum-starved, confluent monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were left untreated or subjected to a calcium switch assay (Zandy et al., 2007) followed by staining of endogenous VE-cadherin and F-actin. Results show that Nck depletion disrupted the organization and dynamics of assembly of VEcadherin-based cell-cell junctions (Supplemental Figure S3). Control and, to a lesser extent, Nck-rescued cells presented robust localization of VE-cadherin staining at sites of cell-cell contact that displayed an organization resembling a trabecular meshwork (Supplemental Figure S3A, top). In contrast, Nck-silenced cells exhibited decreased localization of VE-cadherin at sites of cell-cell contact and almost complete absence of the trabecular meshwork architecture. In addition, calcium switch experiments revealed that Nckdepleted cells had a slight but significant (p < 0.05) delay in the reassembly of cell-cell contacts compared with control or Nck-rescued cells (Supplemental Figure S3, A and B). Of note, total levels of VEcadherin were similar in control, Nck-silenced, and Nck-rescued cells (Supplemental Figure S3C).",

Whereas control and rescued cells developed tubes displaying large, patent lumens and strong accumulation of VE-cadherin at extended cell-cell contacts, Nck-depleted cells formed clusters that failed to develop into a tubular network and exhibited cytosolic accumulation and patchy distribution of VEcadherin at cell-cell contacts. In addition, control and rescued cells role in angiogenic factor-stimulated cytoskeletal remodeling and directional migration of endothelial cells (Stoletov et al., 2001;Kiosses et al., 2002;Lamalice et al., 2006;Anselmi et al., 2012;Chaki et al., 2013). However, how Nck regulates molecular and cellular mechanisms enabling endothelial morphogenesis remains largely undetermined. Using a combination of molecular genetics and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative optical microscopy we now provide evidence that Nck regulates endothelial apical-basal polarization and lumenization through the correct localization and activation of the cell division control protein homologue 42 (Cdc42)/ atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complex. These findings highlight Nck as a key molecular hub downstream of multiple angiogenic cues and potential target for the development of effective antiangiogenic therapies.",

The formation of solid cords on a planar growth factor-reduced matrix involves a cytoskeletal response resembling that of capillary morphogenesis. To manipulate the cellular levels of Nck (Supplemental Figure S1C), we used a previously validated loss-of-function approach based on the expression of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that consistently induced a >50% decrease in Nck1/2 protein levels (Chaki et al., 2013). As a control, we used the same silencing vector (pSuper) not expressing shRNAs (empty vector). In addition, we rescued Nck1/2-silenced cells with retroviral particles harboring an shRNA-resistant mouse Nck2 cDNA that resulted in expression levels slightly above that of the endogenous Nck (Chaki et al., 2013). Results show that control cells (empty vector), but not cells expressing short hairpins targeting Nck1 and Nck2 (shNck1 and 2), developed a robust and well-interconnected network of cords (Supplemental Figure S1A). Furthermore, reexpression of shRNA-resistant Nck in Nck1/2-silenced cells restored cord formation. Quantitative analysis showed a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in cord length, number of branching points, and nodes in Nck-depleted (shNck1 and 2) versus control or rescued cells (Supplemental Figure S1B).",

Tube formation in 3D matrices entails matrix remodeling, endothelial cell invasion, polarization, and lumenization (Koh et al., 2008b). As shown in Figure 1A, control and Nck-rescued cells formed more robust networks of interconnected tubes in collagen than did Nck-silenced cells. In addition, lumenization was only apparent in control and rescued cells, whereas mostly large intracellular vacuoles were observed in Nck-depleted cells.

            "text": "Proposed mechanisms of the de novo endothelial lumen formation, that is, cord and cell hollowing, involve the vesicular delivery of fluids and membrane material to areas of cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts (Sigurbjornsdottir et al., 2014). We hypothesized that the altered junctional VE-cadherin and cytoskeletal organization resulting from abrogation of Nck signaling leads to defective cell polarization and, consequently, incomplete lumen formation/expansion. To test this prediction, we performed immunostaining of endogenous podocalyxin (PDXL), a highly sialylated transmembrane protein involved in lumen expansion that is recruited to endothelial cell-cell contacts in a VE-cadherin-dependent manner (Strilic et al., 2009). In confluent monolayers of control and rescued HUVECs, PDXL colocalized with VE-cadherin at robust cell-cell contacts (Supplemental Figure S4A and Supplemental Animation S2). In contrast, monolayers of Nck-silenced cells showed a more diffused PDXL staining, with increased cytoplasmic and decreased junctional accumulation (Supplemental Figure S4B, top and middle). In addition, Nck-depleted but not control or rescued cells had a decreased (p < 0.01) junction-to-cytoplasmic PDXL ratio (Supplemental Figure S4B, bottom). Of note, the presence of PDXL/VE-cadherin-enriched cytoplasmic/membrane vesicles was readily apparent in confocal z-stacks from Nck-depleted but not control or rescued monolayers (Supplemental Figure S4A and Supplemental Animation S2). The presence of PDXL-enriched vesicles/clusters in monolayers of Ncksilenced cells was also confirmed by groundstate depletion superresolution imaging (Supplemental Figure S4C). Next we determined the role of Nck in endothelial polarity in 3D environments. HUVECs undergoing morphogenesis in collagen I were fixed and stained with anti-PDXL, a luminal surface marker, and fluorescent phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. In control and rescued groups, endogenous PDXL localized to luminal membranes of endothelial cells that also displayed strong actin bundles showed a robust cytoskeletal architecture that included long F-actin bundles delimiting extended lumens. Nck-silenced cells, in contrast, exhibited significant disruption of the cytoskeletal architecture, including the presence of F-actin aggregates and short F-actin bundles surrounding vacuolar and poorly developed hollow structures ( Figure 3A and Supplemental Animation S1). Image analysis endothelial cell-cell contacts. Quantitative image analysis showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in the average fluorescence intensity of luminal PDXL ( Figure 4C). In addition, the extent of PDXL localization to luminal region, quantified as percentage of the luminal perimeter decorated with PDXL staining, was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in Nck-silenced versus control or rescued cultures ( Figure 4D). The loss of PDXL polarization induced by Nck silencing was accompanied by disorganization of the architecture of actin filaments. Taken together, these findings suggest that changes in actin organization resulting from abrogation of Nck signaling contribute to loss of endothelial cell apical-basal polarity and deficient lumen formation.",

            "text": "To ascertain the mechanism by which Nck regulates endothelial polarity and tube morphogenesis, we determined patterns of Cdc42 activation in cells undergoing morphogenesis in 3D collagen matrices. First, the status of endogenous Cdc42 activation was ascertained using an antibody that recognizes the GTP-bound, active form of Cdc42 (Baschieri et al., 2014). In contrast to the strong luminal localization of endogenous GTP-bound Cdc42 in control and rescued cells, active Cdc42 staining was greatly decreased and distributed diffusively through the cytoplasm in Nck silenced cells ( Figure 5A and Supplemental Animation S4). Remarkably, small lumens occasionally formed by Nck-knockdown cells showed almost complete absence of active Cdc42. As previously noted, the loss of Nck lead to disruption of the architecture of actin filaments. Line scans across sections of 3D cultures showed unpolarized distribution and greatly decreased overall intensity of active Cdc42 staining in Nck-silenced versus control/rescued cells ( Figure 5B). Quantitative image analysis showed a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the average fluorescence intensity of luminal active Cdc42 ( Figure 5C). To further assess the role of Nck in the activation of Cdc42, we performed pull-down assays of endogenous GTP-bound Cdc42 in cell extracts obtained from 3D cultures (Koh et al., 2008b) using immobilized Pak1 PBD domains (Benard and Bokoch, 2002). Consistent with the immunostaining findings, active/GTP-bound but not total Cdc42 was reduced (p < 0.05) in cell extracts from Nck-silenced cells compared to control or rescued cells ( Figure 5, D and E).",

In contrast to delimiting the abluminal surface of well-developed tubes ( Figure 4A and Supplemental Animation S3). Line scans encompassing wall and lumens of control and rescued endothelial tubes clearly showed the polarized distribution of PDXL and actin bundles ( Figure 4B). In contrast, within the small number of the 3D structures formed by Nck-silenced cells, the distribution of PDXL and the architecture of F-actin were profoundly disrupted ( Figure 4, A and B). Consistent with findings in monolayers, Nck depletion led to diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and slight enrichment of PDXL in poorly developed the robust activation of Cdc42 observed in cultures of control and rescued cells, the overall Cdc42 activation was significantly decreased in Nck-silenced cells ( Figure 6, A and B). Compared to Nck-depleted cells, control and rescued cells showed more polarized Cdc42 activation, as evidenced by the progressive increase in FRET/teal fluorescent protein (TFP) signal from the abluminal to the luminal membrane ( Figure 6, A and C). A striking association between localized Cdc42 activation and lumen expansion was present in control and rescued but not Nck-silenced cells (Supplemental Movie S1).",

Previous studies showed that disruption of the Cdc42-Par3-Par6-aPKC polarity complex leads to impaired endothelial cell lumen and tube formation in 3D collagen matrices (Bayless and Davis, 2002;Koh et al., 2008a). Thus, to ascertain the contribution of Nck to the spatial regulation of aPKC activation during endothelial morphogenesis, we performed immunostaining of endogenous, phosphorylated aPKC (p-aPKC) using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated aPKC\u03b6 (phospho-T410) and aPKC\u03b9/\u03bb (phospho-T412). Consistent with spatial patterns of Cdc42 activation, strongly polarized p-aPKC staining was observed in control and rescued endothelial tubes ( Figure 7, A and B). As shown in Supplemental Animation S5, control and rescued tubes typically displayed intense luminal p-aPKC signal along with well-organized abluminal F-actin bundles. In contrast, structures formed by Nck-silenced cells role for Nck in the establishment of endothelial apical-basal polarity and lumen formation through a mechanism that involves spatiotemporal regulation of the Cdc42/aPKC polarity complex.",

            "text": "The present study provides evidence that Nck, a family of multidomain adaptors, plays an essential role in the coordination of key cellular behaviors during endothelial morphogenesis. We show that showed diffuse (unpolarized) and significantly decreased overall p-aPKC staining. Quantitative image analysis showed a significant decrease in the average fluorescence intensity of luminal p-aPKC in Nck-silencing versus control and rescued cells ( Figure 7C). Consistent with these findings, levels of phosphorylated (active) aPKC, determined by Western blotting, were significantly decreased in extracts from 3D cultures of Nck-silenced cells compared to control or rescued cells ( Figure 7D). Collectively these results show a key  effectors (Pawson, 2007;Good et al., 2011). The present findings support the hypothesis that Nck acts as a hub integrating signals driving endothelial morphogenesis. Bladt et al. (2003) described profound developmental defects in mesoderm-derived tissues and embryonic lethality in mice caused by inactivation of Nck (both Nck1 and Nck2). Similarly, findings from a recent study showed that constitutive deletion of Nck in the endothelium of mice results in impaired cardiovascular development and embryonic lethality (Clouthier et al., 2015). Although the study by abrogation of Nck disrupts the architectural organization of the actin cytoskeleton and VE-cadherin junctions, resulting in loss of endothelial apical-basal polarity and impaired lumen formation. Through the combination of 3D live-cell imaging and biochemistry, this study highlights new mechanistic insights by which Nck modulates the spatiotemporal activation of the Cdc42/aPKC polarity complex. These finding are consistent with current views that, rather than simple docking or molecular linkers, adaptor proteins integrate and specify the flow of information in signaling networks by dynamically engaging distinct interaction partners at specific subcellular locations, promoting cooperative binding and clustering signaling FIGURE 6: Nck modulates the spatiotemporal activation of Cdc42 in endothelial cells cultured in 3D collagen matrices. (A) FRET/TFP ratio images selected from time-lapse series of 3D cultures of HUVECs expressing the Raichu-Cdc42 FRET biosensor. The ROIs (dotted squares) were magnified and are shown to the right.

Nonetheless, the establishment of endothelial apical-basal polarity is believed to be a prerequisite for endothelial lumenization. Among various molecular players, \u03b21 integrin (Zovein et al., 2010) and VE-cadherin (Lampugnani et al., 2010) have been identified as key drivers of endothelial polarity and lumen formation. Both \u03b21 integrin and VEcadherin coordinate the recruitment of actin filaments and apical proteins, including sialomucins, to the incipient endothelial lumen (Strilic et al., 2009;Zovein et al., 2010). Remarkably, the disruption of junctional VE-cadherin and F-actin organization induced by Nck silencing caused delocalization of the sialomucin PDXL and loss of apical-basal endothelial polarity. Accordingly, Nck silencing resulted in negligible luminal formation or the formation of intracellular vacuoles and intercellular luminal structures that failed to coalesce/ expand. Thus we propose that Nck promotes endothelial cell interface elongation by a mechanism that involves localized actin polymerization/stabilization and, consequently, the organization of junctional VE-cadherin.",

For example, a recent study showed that integrin \u03b21 function is required for proper localization of VE-cadherin, endothelial cell-cell junction integrity, and the formation of stable, nonleaky blood vessels through a mechanism that involves RhoA and Rap1 activation (Yamamoto et al., 2015). Of interest, mouse embryos lacking endothelial Nck showed compromised vascular integrity, including increased edema and profuse hemorrhages (Clouthier et al., 2015). We showed previously that Nck modulates integrin \u03b15\u03b21-extracellular matrix adhesion force and endothelial cell stiffness by regulating the activation of RhoA (Chaki et al., 2013). Collectively these findings suggest that Nck integrates signaling networks responsive to cell-cell and cell-matrix cues.",

            "text": "The Rho GTPases-molecular switches that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics (Hall, 2012)-are major determinants of cell polarity (Roignot et al., 2013;Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014). In particular, Cdc42 (Bayless and Davis, 2002;Koh et al., 2008a;Qi et al., 2011;Jin et al., 2013;Liu et al., 2013) and its effector the Par3/Par6/aPKC complex (Kamei et al., 2006;Koh et al., 2008a;Qi et al., 2011) are required for endothelial lumen formation. Here we demonstrate that Nck specifies spatiotemporal patterns of Cdc42/ aPKC activation during endothelial morphogenesis. Previous studies documented the cooperation between Nck and Cdc42 in the activation of N-WASp-stimulated actin polymerization (Dart et al., 2012;Humphries et al., 2014). Further, the Cdc42/Par6/aPKC polarity axis was shown to regulate adherens junction stability through modulation of N-WASp/Arp2/3-dependent actin remodeling (Georgiou et al., 2008). Because Nck stimulates N-WASp/ Arp2-3-dependent actin polymerization (Rivera et al., 2004;Ditlev et al., 2012), we postulate that Nck modulates morphogenesis by linking spatiotemporally restricted activation of Cdc42-dependent polarity signals, junctional actin polymerization, and VE-cadherin adhesion dynamics. Given its significant role in signaling downstream of integrin (Tu et al., 1998;Goicoechea et al., 2002;Vaynberg et al., 2005), VEGF (Stoletov et al., 2001;Lamalice et al., 2006), and guidance receptors (Cheng et al., 2002;Li et al., 2002;Fan et al., 2003;Miura et al., 2009), the Nck hub appears uniquely Clouthier et al. (2015) established that Nck is required for endothelial tip cell sprouting, insights into the precise role of Nck in the regulation of angiogenesis were limited by early embryonic lethality.",

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying Nck-regulated endothelial morphogenesis have remained largely unknown. Our present findings disclose new links between Nck-mediated actin remodeling and key cellular mechanisms necessary for endothelial lumen formation, including intercellular junctional elongation and apical-basal polarization. Remarkably, Nck silencing suppressed lumen formation or resulted in intracellular vacuoles/small luminal structures that fail to coalesce and/or expand. We speculate that Nck contributes to endothelial lumenization through regulation of the fusogenic, adhesion, and matrix-remodeling machineries of endothelial cells.",

Dynamics of actin filaments and endothelial adherens junctions are reciprocally regulated (Abu Taha et al., 2014). Here we provide evidence that Nck silencing results in altered endothelial cell morphology, disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and disruption of VE-cadherin cell-cell junctions. This is consistent with recent findings in zebrafish showing that VE-cadherin ablation impairs actin polymerization, stalk cell elongation, and the extension of the endothelial cell-cell interface (Sauteur et al., 2014). Given that pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization phenocopies the junctional defects resulting from VE-cadherin deletion (Sauteur et al., 2014), it is possible that localized actin polymerization stimulated by Nck promotes junction elongation.",

            "text": "Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation and filament stabilization are involved in the formation of cortical actin rings that support intercellular junctional organization (Kovacs et al., 2011;Abu Taha et al., 2014). Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization at endothelial cellcell junctions is promoted by the nucleation-promoting factors neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp; Rajput et al., 2013) and cortactin (Boguslavsky et al., 2007;Han et al., 2014). In vitro, Nck forms a complex with cortactin and WIP/N-WASp that stimulates Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization (Tehrani et al., 2007). In living cells, we demonstrated that clustering of Nck stimulates Arp2/3-stimulated actin polymerization through the activation of WIP/N-WASp (Rivera et al., 2004;Ditlev et al., 2012). Thus the present findings showing that Nck colocalizes with cortactin at VEcadherin cell-cell junctions support the hypothesis that Nck plays a key role in polymerization/stabilization of junctional actin filaments through the cortactin/N-WASp/Arp2/3 axis. Interestingly, zonula occludens (ZO-1), a protein that bridges the cadherin/catenin complex and junctional actin filaments (Itoh et al., 1997), is required for normal cadherin-dependent actin organization during development (Lockwood et al., 2008). Because ZO-1 is recruited to actin filaments induced by membrane-targeted Nck (Hanajima-Ozawa et al., 2007), it represents a plausible link between endothelial adherens junction dynamics and Nck-dependent actin remodeling.",

For quantitative analysis of VE-cadherin, PDXL, active Cdc42, and p-aPKC, the average fluorescence intensity in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the luminal area was measured using ImageJ software. A total of 35-50 ROIs from 3D images pooled from three independent experiments was analyzed. To determine VE-cadherin junctional length and the percentage of luminal perimeter coated with PDXL, the line scan function of ImageJ was used on 25-30 junctions/lumens from three independent experiments. Images from FRET time-lapse series were processed with Fiji. Briefly, a binary mask was derived from the YFP image and was multiplied separately with the TFP and FRET images. Then FRET images were divided by TFP images to obtain FRET/TFP ratio images. A rainbow color LUT was applied, and brightness and contrast were adjusted to display the ratio FRET images in an intensity-modulated manner by which red indicates high and blue indicates low FRET efficiency, respectively. For quantitative analysis, YFP-masked FRET and TFP images were thresholded to measure pixel intensity of each individual image in the stack, and FRET/TFP intensity ratios were calculated as previously described (Chaki et al., 2013). For statistical purposes, time-lapse series were acquired from four to six cells/group. Experiments were repeated three times.",
