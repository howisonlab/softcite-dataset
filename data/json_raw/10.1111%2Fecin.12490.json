Argentina is an interesting case to explore given its high smoking rates, its recent experience with periods of very high and hyperinflation, and the mixed evidence of the effect of prices on smoking onset, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. We used data from four cycles of two large national surveys conducted between 2005 and 2011 and discrete-time hazard models. We found that tobacco prices had a statistically significant and fairly large impact on the hazard of smoking onset, and these findings were robust to alternative specifications. We also found that prices had little effect on the hazards of smoking onset during periods of hyper-and very high inflation, which provide some support for the notion that prices lose their informational role in such periods. Governments need to be cognizant that their most important policy tool to reduce tobacco use-taxes that increase real tobacco prices-is likely no longer effective during these times.

            "text": "Tobacco use causes more than 6 million deaths per year worldwide, a number that is expected to rise to more than 8 million by 2030. The majority of these deaths will occur in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) where 80% of the deaths are expected to take place by 2030 (GBD Risk Factors Collaborators 2016 ;Mathers and Loncar 2006). In addition to the well-known long-term consequences of smoking, smoking during childhood and adolescence causes serious contemporaneous health problems. The US Surgeon General concluded in 2012 that there was sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between active smoking during childhood and adolescence and reduced lung function, impaired lung growth, and wheezing severe enough to be diagnosed as asthma. There is also emerging evidence that youth smoking is associated with various developmental and mental health disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression (US Department of Health and Human Services 2012). Moreover, in addition to its considerable health impact, tobacco use hinders sustainable development and has been formally recognized as a priority for health interventions by the United Nations General Assembly in its Sustainable Development Goals (de Beyer, Lovelace, and Yurekli 2001;Collishaw 2010;United Nations 2015).",

            "text": "A recent systematic review examined the impact of tobacco prices or taxes on tobacco use in Latin American and Caribbean countries and found that cigarette prices had a negative and statistically significant effect on cigarette consumption (Guindon, Paraje, and Chaloupka 2015). The review concluded that in most Latin American countries, total own-price elasticity for cigarettes was likely below |-0.5| but noted a lack of studies that used individual-level data. The systematic review identified two sets of studies that used aggregate time series data from Argentina (Gonz\u00e1les-Rozada and Rodriguez Iglesias 2013; Martinez, Mejia, and Perez-Stable 2015). Estimates were remarkably similar across studies and suggested a long-run price elasticity for cigarettes of about \u22120.3. Studies that use aggregate time series data such as national cigarette consumption or sales are unable to examine the effect that tax or price changes have on smoking participation, consumption, onset or cessation, or different responses across groups (e.g., across individuals of different socioeconomic status [SES]). Another recent review examined the impact of tobacco prices on smoking onset (i.e., the transition between never smoking and smoking) and concluded that existing studies did not provide strong evidence that tobacco prices or taxes affect smoking onset, in part due to a reliance on empirical approaches that were methodologically weak (Guindon 2014a(Guindon , 2014b. Moreover, the review identified only three studies that were conducted using data from LMIC (China, Russia, and Vietnam) (Laxminarayan and Deolalikar 2004;Arzhenovskiy 2006;Kenkel, Lillard, and Liu 2009). The review also identified one study that used crosscountry data from non-representative national or sub-national surveys of school-children and -teens conducted in 48 LMIC (Kostova 2013). More recently, the impact of prices on smoking onset has been examined using data from China, South Africa, and Vietnam (Guindon 2014a;Kostova, Husain, and Chaloupka 2016;Vellios and van Walbeek 2016). On the whole, none of the existing studies are easily generalizable to Latin American countries. 1 Argentina's situation presents a unique opportunity to examine price responsiveness in a high-inflation environment. During most of its recent history, Argentina experienced some of the world's most acute inflation episodes. Between 1980 and 1991, overall prices increased by more than 8,000,000,000%; in 1990 alone inflation neared 5,000%. This period of high inflation was followed by a rapid price stabilization process, which saw inflation fall to 83% in 1991, 17.5% in 1992, and 7.4% in 1993. Prices have been relatively stable since the early 1990s, but even so, overall prices increased by about 185%-350% between 2000 and 2011 (Cavallo 2013;INDEC 2014;International Monetary Fund 2015). Economic and political actors have become so sensitive to general price increases that in recent years the National Statistical Office has been accused of deliberately reporting lower inflation figures (International Monetary Fund 2013;The Economist 2012.",

Ball and Romer (2003) argued that high inflation has an important 1. Price responsiveness may differ between high-income countries and lower-income countries and between Latin American and non-Latin American countries for a number of reasons. First, Warner (1990) argued that price responsiveness of tobacco users in LMIC ought to be substantially higher than users in more affluent countries because LMIC consumers have relatively fewer resources. Second, Chaloupka et al. (2000, 246) pointed out that \"economic models of addiction suggest that the generally lower level of education in lower-income countries is likely to make the demand for tobacco products in these countries relatively more responsive to changes in monetary prices than demand in higher-income countries.\" Third, there is evidence that consumers with different levels of income or wealth behave differently when it comes to choices involving intertemporal trade-offs; poorer consumers are likely more impatient than more affluent ones (Carvalho 2010). Fourth, the availability and prices of substitutes and complements may well differ between national or regional markets (e.g., local distilled alcoholic beverages). twofold effect on the relationship between prices and demand. First, inflation reduces the informativeness of current prices, causing customers to make costly mistakes about which long-term relationships to enter. Second, because prices have become less informative, they have less influence on consumers' decision, and as demand becomes less elastic, producers increase their mark-ups. Ball and Romer argued that both effects can be quantitatively important at moderate inflation rates. Between 1980 and 1991, inflation was anything but moderate in Argentina fluctuating between 80% and 5,000% annually. Such high rates of inflation may lead markets to break down completely. In the context of smoking, during high inflation periods in which prices provide little information, prices may cease to have any effects on tobacco use generally and smoking onset in particular. Consequently, it may be the case that governments lose their most potent policy tool to reduce tobacco use (i.e., taxes that increase real tobacco prices) during periods of high inflation. High inflation, however, may affect smoking decisions through other pathways than price. For example, Deaton (1977) suggested that unanticipated inflation may lead consumers to believe that all goods are more expensive and result in a decrease in real consumption. Inflation may impact time preference, which may in turn affect smoking (Gong 2006;Khwaja, Silverman, and Sloan 2007). Or times of high inflation may lead to increased stress which in turn may effect smoking onset (Finkelstein, Kubzansky, and Goodman 2006;Iakunchykova et al. 2015).",

The 2011 National Tobacco Law, which came into effect in 2013, generally follows the recommendations of the FCTC including a ban on smoking in all indoor areas. Provinces, however, have unevenly implemented important provisions of the National Tobacco Law. The general lack of leadership at the federal level has led many provinces and some municipalities to introduce smokefree policies prior to the National Tobacco Law. There is some evidence that smokefree policies decreased acute coronary syndrome admissions after their implementation in the province of Santa Fe and the city of Buenos Aires and improved respiratory health in the city of Neuquen (Ferrante et al. 2012;Schoj et al. 2010). Although most tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship were banned in 2013, advertising at point of sale is still pervasive. Prior to 2013, tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship were widespread. Advertising and promotion were loosely regulated in 1986 by Law 23.344, which also mandated a warning label for cigarettes. Argentina's two leading multinationals-Massalin Particulares (Philip Morris) and Nobleza-Piccardo (British-American Tobacco)-control nearly 100% of the Argentinian cigarette market (ERC 2014).",

            "text": "Argentina's overall tax system is extremely complex; the structure of tobacco taxation, and in particular, the taxation of cigarettes, even more so. In addition to general taxes such as valueadded tax that are broadly applied to most goods and services, Argentina uses two taxes that are specifically applied to cigarettes. First, an ad valorem tax (impuestos internos or internal tax) is applied on the retail price of cigarettes (minus other taxes) at a rate of 75%, last changed in May 2016 (the rate had been 60% since 1996). In 2004, a minimum tax revenue condition was introduced which stipulates that the revenue from the internal tax cannot be less than 75% of the tax levied on the most popular brand. In January 1996, Argentina introduced an ad valorem emergency tax (Impuesto Adicional de Emergencia [IAE]) at a rate of 7% of the retail price, net of all taxes, later increased to 31% in December 1999. The IAE was subsequently decreased to 16, 12 and finally 7% in February 2001. There is also a relatively small dedicated tax (Fondo Especial del Tabaco) that is used to support tobacco growers. Recently, nominal cigarette price increases have been set by agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the tobacco industry to reach particular tax collection objectives (Rodriguez-Iglesias et al. 2015), though very little information is publicly available for the terms of these agreements. Since the early 2000s and until very recently, on the whole, taxes on cigarettes have either remained relatively stable or have decreased. More importantly, cigarettes in Argentina have become more affordable: both overall inflation and incomes have outpaced increases in nominal cigarette prices since the early 2000s (Rodriguez-Iglesias et al. 2015). Figure 1 presents a timeline of key tobacco control measures and key political, monetary, and inflation events.",

This approach is not problematic as individuals residing outside Greater Buenos Aires face the same cigarette prices as those residing in that area (i.e., cigarette prices do not vary by neighborhood or regions in Argentina). Other countries such as Chile and France have similar \"uniform\" price regulations (i.e., prices vary between brands, but the prices of individual brands do not vary across space). These data were available from January 1980 to May 2008. From May 2008 to 2011, we used the after-tax monthly weighted average price for a pack of 20 cigarettes reported by the Ministerio de Agricultura, Ganader\u00eda y Pesca, as INDEC stopped reporting CPI for individual categories in May 2008. 2 2.

As a measure of overall inflation, we used CPI all-items for Greater Buenos Aires (IPC nivel general) which was available for the period 1980-2011. The quality, or lack thereof, of INDEC's CPI figures from 2007 is well documented (International Monetary Fund 2013; The Economist 2012, 2014). In February 2013, after several warnings, the International Monetary Fund issued a declaration of censure against Argentina. As an alternative measure of inflation from January 2007, we used estimates for the Sante Fe province (the second largest province, situated in the central region) calculated and reported by the Sante Fe statistical office. As a sensitivity check, we used estimates calculated by MIT's Billion Prices Project (Cavallo 2013) and State Street, a financial services firm. The latter series began in December 2007. Figure 2 shows changes in the real prices of cigarettes from 1980. The 1980s were characterized by high volatility. For example, between January 1980 and June 1982, real cigarette prices increased by nearly 60% before plunging by about 80% over the next 28 months. Such extreme price swings occurred throughout the 1980s. The abrupt drops in the real prices of cigarettes are explained by pronounced increases in the general inflation and not by decreases in the nominal prices of cigarettes. Overall inflation subsided in the early 1990s and coincided with a fairly long and sustained decrease in real cigarette prices (from mid-1991 to the early of 1996). For the remainder of the 1990s, real cigarette prices remained fairly stable, with the exception of one real price hike in early 1996. Volatility in prices returned in the 2000s, albeit to a much lesser extent than the 1980s. From 2007, trends in real prices depend greatly on which estimates of overall inflation are used. From 2007, Figure 2 shows We used data from two national surveys. First, we used data from the Encuesta Nacional Factores de Riesgo (ENFR) conducted in 2005 and 2009. ENFR is a risk factor survey that is representative at national and province level for urban populations (about 90% of Argentines live in urban areas).",

Cagan defines hyperinflation \"as beginning in the month the rise in prices exceeds 50 percent and as ending in the month before the monthly rise in prices drops below that amount and stays below for at least a year\" (Fischer, Sahay, and V\u00e9gh 2002, 840). Second, we followed Fisher et al.'s approach to define very high inflation. Very high inflationary episode is defined as taking place when the 12month inflation rate rises above 100%. Cagan's definition indicates that Argentina experienced hyperinflation from May 1989 to March 1990 while Fischer, Sahay, and V\u00e9gh's indicates that Argentina experienced very high inflation from July 1974 to October 1991. All other variables are time-invariant. As a measure of socioeconomic status, we used educational attainment of the household head (three binary indicators, primary, secondary, and more than secondary). This measure of SES, however, is inherently time-varying, but due to the nature of the data, enters models as a time invariant variable. Given the relatively young age of the respondents in our sample, we feel that SES at the time of survey is a reasonable proxy for SES at the time at which individuals were at risk of starting smoking. Moreover, intergenerational income mobility is relatively low in Argentina (Jimenez and Gasparini 2010). Other individual covariates include sex and geographical region.",

One advantage of duration or survival models is their ability to take into account observations that are censored (in our case, individuals who have not yet started smoking at interview).

As a functional form for the baseline hazard function, we used a cubic polynomial specification. As a sensitivity check, we also used a more flexible approach and used a dummy specification for time at risk, measured in years. An even more flexible approach would use a dummy specification for time at risk measured in months.

Second, the assumption that the hazard function given age and other covariates does not change with calendar time may not be valid. However, it is difficult to identify calendar time and duration effects separately when one includes a measure of calendar time as they are correlated by construction. Hence, it is generally not recommended to include a measure of calendar time in duration models. We used a somewhat less problematic specification and estimated models that control for differing birth cohorts (Korn, Graubard, and Midthune 1997).

Third, increases in cigarette taxes may be proxies for unobserved sentiment against cigarette smoking (i.e., changes in anti-smoking sentiment may drive higher taxes and prices) . In the Argentinian context, it is unlikely that changes in anti-smoking sentiment were associated with changes in cigarette prices. As shown in Figure 2, to be correlated with prices, anti-smoking sentiment would have had to fluctuate in an extremely unusual fashion (e.g., decrease from the early 1990s, then suddenly increase, followed by a sharp decrease and an even sharper increase in the early 2000s). Moreover, there is no indication that the national government ever had a public health objective to increase prices (driven or not by \"anti-smoking sentiment\").

Hazard ratios (i.e., the exponential of the reported coefficients) are more intuitive to assess the effects of dichotomous indicators. For example, in Table 2, a hazard ratio of 0.7 (i.e., exp.(\u22120.36)) suggests that women have lower hazards to begin smoking than men and that the difference between the hazards of men and women is about 43%. 7 All models suggest a fairly large, negative, and statistically significant association between prices of tobacco products and the hazard of smoking onset. Price elasticity estimates from our preferred specifications (Table 2, models 1 to 6) fall within a fairly narrow range centered around \u22120.45. Including additional covariates does not alter price elasticity estimates in any significant or substantial way.

Women and higher SES individuals appear to be at lower risk of smoking onset than men and low SES individuals; the differences between SES levels, however, are fairly small. Our measures of hyper-and very high inflation do not, on the whole, suggest that the hazards of smoking onset were any different in times of hyper-or very high inflation. We found that alcohol prices have a statistically significant and fairly large effect on the hazard of smoking onset. We found that a 1% increase in the price of alcohol products increases the hazard of smoking onset by about 0.7%.

Table 3 presents results of models that examine differences in the effect of prices on smoking onset across sex, SES, and between high and low inflation periods. We interacted, in turn, prices with sex, household head's highest education level, and our binary measures of periods of hyper-or very high inflation. First, we found that women were about twice more responsive to changes in prices than men. Second, we did not find that low-SES individuals were more responsive than individuals of higher SES. If anything, our findings suggest that individuals with higher SES were more responsive to price. Lastly, we found striking differences in the effect of prices on smoking onset between inflation periods.

This is not surprising as only about 1% of individuals reported having started smoking before the age of 12. As an alternative functional form for the baseline hazard function, we used a dummy specification for time at risk, measured in years. Here again, none of the results varied in any substantive way. We estimated discrete time split population models and also found relatively large,  negative, and statistically significant association between prices of tobacco products and the hazard of smoking onset. We did found, however, on the whole, greater variations between specifications. Using data measured annually instead of monthly did not change our results in any significant or substantial way. On the whole, these results were in line with results obtained using monthly data; estimates of own-price and crossprice elasticities were similar or somewhat higher (in absolute value). Our analyses without sampling weights did not reveal any substantive differences in price effects. Finally, we attempted to control for calendar year effects. With one exception, all model specifications suggested price elasticities that were statistically significant. On the whole, estimates of price elasticities were somewhat lower (in absolute value); estimates of own-price elasticities ranged from about \u22120.25 to \u22120.3 while estimates of cross-price elasticities were fairly narrowly centered around 0.45.

Nearly all studies, however, were conducted using data from high-income countries and none looked at the effect of alcohol prices on smoking onset. More recently, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization (2016) concluded that evidence was too mixed to make any definitive statement. Our results indicate that higher alcohol prices increased the hazard of smoking onset, which suggests that cigarettes and alcoholic beverages were substitutes. This finding may suggest that Argentine youth that were prone to risky health behaviors such as drinking and smoking were more likely to start smoking when the price of other risky behaviors such as drinking increased.",

            "text": "First, using cross-sectional self-reported data to construct smoking histories may introduce bias in the dependent variable (Taurus and Chaloupka 1999). Although the dataset we constructed is retrospective, the relatively young age of respondents likely reduces the possibility of recall bias. Moreover, a number of studies have compared reconstructed smoking prevalence rates and contemporary measured rates and concluded that they matched relatively well, especially when the focus was on younger populations (which is our case) (Kenkel, Lillard, and Mathios 2004;Christopoulou et al. 2011). Heaping (when respondents cannot recall a specific value and provide a \"prototypical\" response near the actual value, resulting in the over-representation of certain values, such as 15, 18, or 20 years of age) can result in a mismatch between our price variable and our dependent variable, smoking onset (Grotpeter 2008;Bar and Lillard 2012). Figure 6 presents histograms of age of onset, by survey wave. These figures show possible heaping at 15, 18, and 20. We re-estimated key models with three dummy variables for those who started smoking at 15, 18, and 20 and found no qualitative differences. Second, the data we utilized allowed us to bound the age of onset within intervals of 12-24 months. This may be problematic in periods of high inflation as month-to-month changes in prices can be substantial. Third, the nature of the data limited our ability to include more time-varying individualor household-level covariates. For example, we were unable to use a time-varying measure of household income or even a measure of household income at time of survey. Although SES is inherently time-varying, we used a time-invariant measure of SES (educational attainment of the household head). Given the relatively young age of the respondents in our sample and the relatively low levels of inter-generational income mobility in Argentina, we feel that SES at time of survey is a reasonable proxy for SES for the time at which individuals were at risk of starting smoking. Nevertheless, our SES results should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, unlike cigarette prices that do not vary between regions in Argentina, alcohol prices do vary between regions. Consequently, our finding that tobacco and alcohol are substitutes should be interpreted with caution.",

Of particular interest is the finding that prices have no effect on the hazard of smoking onset in periods of hyper-and very high inflation. During such periods, governments need to be cognizant that their most important policy tool to reduce tobacco use (i.e., taxes that increase real tobacco prices) is likely no longer effective. This finding is particularly relevant to Argentina's current situation, as its government is currently struggling to keep inflation under control. It is also relevant to several other LMIC that are experiencing high levels of inflation such as Belarus, Malawi, Ukraine, and Venezuela (International Monetary  Fund 2015). At the very least, governments need to ensure that specific tobacco taxes are automatically adjusted for changes in overall inflation as is the case in Australia and Chile.",
