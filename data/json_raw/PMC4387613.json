Ventricular remodeling can occur in approximately 10% of the patients after pacemaker (PM) implantation. Objectives: To assess the functional capacity of children and young adults with isolated CAVB and chronic pacing of the right ventricle (RV) and evaluate its correlation with predictors of ventricular remodeling. Methods: This cross-sectional study used a cohort of patients with isolated CAVB and RV pacing for over a year. The subjects underwent clinical and echocardiographic evaluation. Functional capacity was assessed using the six-minute walk test. Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used, considering a significance level of 5%. Results: A total of 61 individuals were evaluated between March 2010 and December 2013, of which 67.2% were women, aged between 7 and 41 years, who were using PMs for 13.5 \u00b1 6.3 years. The percentage of ventricular pacing was 97.9 \u00b1 4.1%, and the duration of the paced QRS complex was 153.7 \u00b1 19.1 ms. Majority of the subjects (95.1%) were asymptomatic and did not use any medication. The mean distance walked was 546.9 \u00b1 76.2 meters and was strongly correlated with the predicted distance (r = 0.907, p = 0.001) but not with risk factors for ventricular remodeling. Conclusions: The functional capacity of isolated CAVB patients with chronic RV pacing was satisfactory but did not correlate with risk factors for ventricular remodeling.",

The pathophysiology of AV block is strongly correlated with maternal autoimmune diseases [3][4][5][6][7] . The implantation of a permanent cardiac pacemaker (PM) is the only form of treatment and results in significant long-term survival rates [8][9][10] .",

The delayed activation, particularly of the free wall of LV, in relation to the interventricular septum, has been reported as an important cause of decreased efficiency of contraction, leading to increased volume, geometry changes and dysfunction of the LV [23][24][25][26] . The population evaluated comprised individuals without cardiac defects, except CAVB, and represented an excellent model for understanding the effects caused by cardiac dyssynchrony induced by cardiac pacing , considering that, in addition to the normal cardiac anatomy, intraventricular impulse conduction is also normal in most cases. In the present study, we evaluated the primary factors related to poor clinical and functional outcomes, including age at the first PM implantation 27 , pacing mode used 10 , site of RV pacing 11,28,29 , duration of cardiac pacing 7,16,30,31 , duration of the PM-stimulated QRS complex 12,29,30 , presence of dyssynchrony on echocardiography 32,33 , and the presence of maternal autoantibodies [34][35][36] .",

The validity of this equation was tested in 85 subjects aged 41 \u00b1 13 years, who walked 571 \u00b1 74 meters versus a predicted distance of 575 \u00b1 38 meters, which represented 99.6 \u00b1 11.9% of the predicted value. In the present study, although the distance walked was smaller than expected, there was a significant correlation between the predicted and the walked distance, and the values obtained were similar to those achieved by normal subjects [38][39][40] .

Similarly, the lack of a control group prevented the formulation of more consistent hypotheses on the actual effects of PM implantation on the daily lives of patients. The rarity of this condition limits the design of clinical studies aimed at comparing outcomes before and after PM implantation, even in multicenter projects. The longitudinal follow-up, associated with clinical, laboratory, and detailed echocardiographic investigations, may provide more robust evidence on the possible deleterious effects of conventional PMs on the outcomes of individuals presented with isolated CAVB.",

The 6MWT does not determine peak oxygen consumption or allow the identification of the causes underlying potential physical exercise limitations, and this task is more appropriately performed using cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Therefore, the information provided by the 6MWT should be considered complementary to the cardiopulmonary exercise test but not a replacement. On the other hand, the walk test has been widely used to measure clinical outcomes in randomized studies with very large populations of patients with implantable electronic cardiac devices and therefore, can serve as a fast and objective measure of functional capacity and even as a prognostic marker of mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure. Additionally, it has been shown that the 6MWT correlates with the NYHA functional class, peak oxygen consumption, and life quality scores 41 .",
