The present study used RNA interference (RNAi) methodology and celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, to investigate the effect of COX-2 knockdown on the proliferation and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. Human lung adenocarcinoma A549-si10 and LTEP-A2 cells transfected with a specific small interfering RNA (A549-si10 and LTEP-A2-si10, respectively) grew more slowly compared with parental cell lines and cells transfected with pU6. The colony formation of A549-si10 and LTEP-A2-si10 cells was also reduced. In addition, A549-si10 and LTEP-A2-si10 cells were characterized by decreased metastatic and invasive abilities. The proliferation and invasive potential of parental A549 and LTEP-A2 cells was inhibited following treatment with celecoxib. In vivo, a COX-2 knockdown resulted in a decrease of proliferation and reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in A549 xenografts. In conclusion, the present study revealed that COX-2 plays a extremely important role in tumor growth, infiltration and metastasis via the regulation of VEGF, MMP-2 and EGRF expression. Therefore, COX-2 is a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world. Its incidence rate the highest of all human tumors and there are ~1.2 million novel cases each year (1). In addition, lung cancer also has the highest mortality rate of all human cancers, with 15,600 people succumbing to the disease each year, which accounts for 19.4% of the total number of cancer-associated mortalities (1,2). For >80% of lung cancer patients admitted to hospital, the ideal time to receive surgery and multidisciplinary radical cure has already passed (2,3). Although the concept and means of lung cancer treatment in recent years has made considerable progress, the overall effect is not satisfactory.",

            "text": "An association between carcinogenesis and chronic inflammation has long been suspected (4). The accepted hypothesis is that chronic inflammation more often stimulates than inhibits tumor development (5)(6)(7)(8)(9). As a rate-limiting enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandin (PG) and other bioactive lipids. With the exception of being involved in inflammation, COX-2 produces large amounts of PGE2 in tumor tissues (10)(11)(12)(13), and is extremely important in the development of tumors (10,(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19). COX-2 inhibitors have produced encouraging results in preventing and treating certain digestive system cancers (20)(21)(22). The present study hypothesized that COX-2 is associated with malignant cell phenotype in lung cancer. Therefore, the present study investigated whether silencing of COX-2 and the use of celecoxib, an inhibitor of COX-2, affects lung cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness (21,22). The present results demonstrated that silencing of COX-2 and use of celecoxib inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and decreased their invasive abilities. In addition, the present results revealed that the inhibition of a malignant cell phenotype may be associated with an alteration in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression.",

            "text": "Since COX-2 is associated with numerous clinicopathological parameters, it may be extremely important in the occurrence and development of lung cancer. To confirm this hypothesis, the present study used RNAi technology to investigate whether interfering with COX-2 expression affects lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The present results revealed that COX-2 knockdown significantly slowed the proliferation and invasion of LTEP-A2 and A549 lung cancer cells. In mouse xenografts, tumor growth was slowed following silencing of COX-2, which further confirmed our hypothesis. In addition, the present results demonstrated that silencing COX-2 in lung cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell sensitivity to density-dependent inhibition. This is consistent with previous studies (33,34). Notably, COX-2 knockdown clearly inhibited cell migration and invasion, suggesting that COX-2 has an important effect on the metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (35)(36)(37). The present results indicate that COX-2 plays a key role in the proliferation, motility and invasion of lung cancer cells. In order to further confirm the role of COX-2 in tumorigenesis and development, a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, was used by the present study in migration, invasion and proliferation assays, which had similar results compared with COX-2 interference.",

The expression of COX-2 was primarily detected in mouse xenografts to verify the changes following the silencing of COX-2. Since, COX-2 is associated with proliferation, migration and vascular lumen formation of endothelial cells (23,28), VEGF, MMP-2, MMP-9 and EGFR were investigated by the present study. The expression of MMP-2, VEGF and EGFR was clearly reduced following silencing of COX-2. MMP is a protein that degrades the extracellular matrix (38,39), and previous studies have verified the involvement of MMPs in NSCLC (40)(41)(42). In addition, MMP-2 is associated with the lymphatic and vascular invasion of NSCLC, and its expression may predict a poor prognosis of early-stage patients with NSCLC (43). In addition, studies have reported that COX-2 inhibitors inhibit the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in prostate cancer (44). In the present study, silencing of COX-2 resulted in decreased levels of MMP-2; however, there was no alteration in MMP-9 expression in COX-2-silenced cells (A549). These results are consistent with a previous study (45).",

In addition, there is a close association between COX-2 expression and tumor angiogenesis (48). As a result, COX-2 overexpression may increase tumor blood supply and contribute to tumor growth. The present data suggested that silencing COX-2 reduced VEGF expression in A549 cells. EGFR is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Once activated, it leads to cell division, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis (49)(50)(51).
