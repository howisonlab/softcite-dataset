            "text": "Background-Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is an important marker in cardiovascular disorders, being closely associated with morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive assessment by Doppler echocardiography is recommended by current guidelines. So far, the reliability of this method has been assessed only in small studies with contradictory results. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the reliability of noninvasive PAP assessment by Doppler echocardiography compared to invasive measurements in a large patient population. Methods and Results-We retrospectively analyzed data from a large tertiary cardiology department over 6 years in order to compare invasively measured PAP to estimated PAP from echocardiography examinations. N=15 516 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and n=1695 patients with timely matched examinations (within 5 days) were analyzed. In n=1221 (72%) patients, pulmonary hypertension (PH) was diagnosed invasively (postcapillary PH: n=1122 [66%]; precapillary PH: n=99 [6%]). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) was 45.3AE15.5 mm Hg by Doppler echocardiography and 47.4AE16.4 mm Hg by right heart catheterization. Pearson's correlation coefficient was r=0.87 (P<0.0001). Mean right atrial pressure (RAP) was 12.0AE5.7 mm Hg by right heart catheterization and was estimated to be 12.1AE6.6 mm Hg by echocardiography (r=0.82, P<0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of \u00c02.0 mm Hg for sPAP (95% limits of agreement \u00c018.1 to +14.1 mm Hg) and +1.0 mm Hg for RAP (95% limits of agreement +0.1 to +1.9 mm Hg). Noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension with Doppler echocardiography had a good sensitivity (87%) and specificity (79%), positive and negative predictive values (91% and 70%), as well as accuracy (85%) for a sPAP cutoff value of 36 mm Hg (AUC 0.91, P<0.001, CI 0.90 to 0.93). Conclusions-In this study, Doppler echocardiography proved to be a reliable method for the assessment of sPAP, being well suited to establish the noninvasive diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension in patients with cardiac diseases.",

This condition is characterized by an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to right heart failure and death if left untreated.

[10][11][12][13] Although assessment of RAP was simplified, a study by Chan et al 14 in 1987 suggested that this method of noninvasive PAP assessment is superior compared to other noninvasive approaches. 14 For many years, noninvasive PAP measurement by addition of RVSP and estimated RAP is advised and used in standard echocardiography routinely. 7,9,15 However, until now only studies with small and selected patient populations were conducted to assess correlation between sPAP measurements by right heart catheterization and Doppler echocardiography. Furthermore, some recent studies questioned the accuracy of noninvasively measured sPAP.

The comprehensive examination included standard 2D echocardiography for anatomic imaging and Doppler echocardiography for assessment of velocities. Doppler measurements were carried out over 3 heart cycles during passive expiration. All examinations were digitally stored in a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) with accessibility for offline analysis on workstations (Centricity, GE Healthcare Vingmed, Trondheim, Norway). Noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery systolic pressures (sPAP) was achieved by measurement of right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and adding RAP. RVSP was derived from the peak systolic velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation obtained with continuous-wave (CW) Doppler using the modified Bernoulli equation: DP=49Vmax 2 . RAP was estimated by the diameter of the inferior vena cava and its variability during inspiration as described before. 9,21,22 Offline reassessment of CW Doppler spectral envelopes, as well as inferior vena cava diameter and respiratory behavior, was conducted in n=258 examination for clarification of misdiagnosis of PH by 2 independent, experienced examiners blinded to invasive data.",

Thirty years ago, a first publication by Yock and Popp 10 found a high correlation between noninvasive and invasive data in 54 patients (r=0.93, SEE=8 mm Hg). 10 Berger et al 11 found an even higher correlation in a study population of 41, when invasive and noninvasive examinations were conducted simultaneously in almost all patients (r=0.97, SEE=4.9 mm Hg). 11 Currie et al 12 assessed accuracy of noninvasively measured RVSP simultaneously with right heart catheterization in 127 patients and described very good correlations (r=0.96, SEE=7 mm Hg). 12 Vazquez de Prada et al 13 conducted a similar study including 34 patients with adequate CW Doppler tracings, with a time interval of 24 to 48 hours between examinations; nonetheless, they showed high correlations as well (r=0.96). 13 Although recommended in many guidelines 7,9,15 and used routinely, noninvasive quantification of sPAP has never been tested sufficiently in unselected large patient populations undergoing routine echocardiography examination. This lack of information has sparked the discussion about reliability of this method. Few publications had mentioned doubts about is reliability. Arcasoy et al 16 found in a cohort study of 374 patients with advanced lung disease that in 52% of the cases, pressure estimations were inaccurate, and that 48% of patients were false positive for pulmonary hypertension as determined by echocardiography. Noninvasive estimation of sPAP was not possible in 57% of the patients. The authors suggested that factors related to chronic pulmonary disease may have influenced the results, limiting accurate visualization and measurement of the tricuspid regurgitation jet. 16 In our study, only 424 patients had to be excluded due to the absence of tricuspid regurgitation (20%). This ratio is much lower than described by Arcasoy et al. 16 In 227 of these 424 patients, pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary artery pressure \u226525 mm Hg was documented invasively, confirming that absence of a measurable tricuspid regurgitation does not exclude PH.",

            "text": "Three recent meta-analyses by Zhan et al, 23 Janda et al 24 , and Taleb et al 25 assessed this issue on the basis of n=736 (6 studies), n=1485 (29 studies), and n=522 (9 studies), respectively. The mean time interval between echocardiography and right heart catheterization of the included studies ranged from 2 hours to 90 days. The reported results are not completely consistent. Whereas accuracy calculated with the random effects model by Taleb et al 25 was low (73%), sensitivity for diagnosis was similarly high in all 3 metaanalyses (82%, 83%, and 88%, respectively). Specificity was found to show a higher variation (68%, 72%, and 56%, respectively). [23][24][25] In our study, the receiver operating characteristics analysis demonstrates a high diagnostic accuracy for a sPAP cut-off value of 36 mm Hg (AUC=0.91, sensitiv-ity=87%, specificity=79%, accuracy=85%, Figure 3 and Table 5). Higher cut-off levels show better specificity for diagnosis of PH, but on the basis of increasing numbers of patients with missed diagnoses. Even lower cut-off levels may be appropriate in younger persons as sPAP values are age dependent as described in a comprehensive echocardiography study by Lam et al. 6 Potential sources of error for the sPAP assessment with Doppler echocardiography were already discussed by Yock and Popp, 10 and commented on in the subsequent studies. 11,12,[17][18][19][20] In our study, we could document a series of sources of error in an offline analysis of all cases, with significant overestimation or underestimation (Table 6).

Thus, optimal settings when assessing tricuspid regurgitation velocities should be taken into account. Further pitfalls should be kept in mind. Stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve, or the pulmonary trunk may lead to systematic overestimation of right ventricular systolic pressure. Severe tricuspid insufficiency may lead to underestimation as pressure gradients decrease with increasing effective regurgitant orifice area. Furthermore, since the absence of tricuspid regurgitation does not rule out PH, the presence of indirect signs must be observed. Based on our experience, the following aspects should be considered for best results: (1) since angle between ultrasound beam and direction of flow must be kept to a minimum, tricuspid regurgitation should first be detected with color Doppler from the best ultrasound view and multiple transducer positions may be necessary; (2) settings should be corrected, a colored spectral wave should be chosen, gain for optimal signalto-noise ratio, velocity range allowing waves to fill at least two thirds of spectral depiction, and sweep velocity set to 100 to 200 mm/s should be attempted; (3) only signals extended for at least half of the systole should be measured, and incomplete or absent tricuspid regurgitation may be avoided by increasing blood pool volume with a strategy as simple as drinking a cup of water before examination; (4) maximal velocities in the presence of atrial fibrillation should be averaged; and (5) maximal velocities should be measured at the best spectralwave boundary, avoiding including Doppler artifacts (\"fringes\").",
