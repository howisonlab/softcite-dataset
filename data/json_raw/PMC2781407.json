            "text": "TMP21 has been shown to be associated with the \u2425-secretase complex and can specifically regulate \u2425-cleavage without affecting \u2440-mediated proteolysis. To explore the basis of this activity, TMP21 modulation of \u2425-secretase activity was investigated independent of \u2440-cleavage using an amyloid-\u2424 precursor pro-tein\u2440 (APP\u2440) construct which lacks the amyloid intracellular domain domain. The APP\u2440 construct behaves similarly to the full-length precursor protein with respect to \u2423and \u2424-cleavages and is able to undergo normal \u2425-processing. Co-expression of APP\u2440 and TMP21 resulted in the accumulation of membraneembedded higher molecular weight A\u2424-positive fragments, consistent with an inhibition of \u2425-secretase cleavage. The APP\u2440 system was used to examine the functional domains of TMP21 through the investigation of a series of TMP21-p24a chimera proteins. It was found that chimeras containing the transmembrane domain bound to the \u2425-secretase complex and could decrease \u2425-secretase proteolytic processing. This was confirmed though investigation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the TMP21 transmembrane helix. The isolated TMP21 TM peptide but not the homologous p24a domain was able to reduce A\u2424 production in a dose-dependent fashion. These observations suggest that the TMP21 transmembrane domain promotes its association with the presenilin complex that results in decreased \u2425-cleavage activity. Alzheimer disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia worldwide. One"

Cleavage by \u2425-secretase occurs within the APP transmembrane domain at several sequences, such as the \u2425-site, to produce A\u242440/42, and the \u2440-site, which results in the release of the cytosolic amyloid intracellular domain (AICD) (2). AICD is targeted to the nucleus and regulates transcription of several genes including KAI1 (3,4), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (4 -6), neprilysin (7,8), p53 (9), epidermal growth factor receptor (10), LRP1 (11), Tip60, APP, or \u2424-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) (4).",

All four components appear to be essential for \u2425/\u2440-secretase activity (17)(18)(19). NCT and APH-1 form an initial subcomplex to which full-length PS1 or PS2 and PEN-2 are added (18,20,21). During maturation of the presenilin complexes, nicastrin is glycosylated, and presenilins are cleaved into Nand C-terminal fragments which remain associated as a heterodimer in the active high molecular weight complex (20,22). In these complexes presenilins have been proposed to serve as the catalytic subunit (23), whereas the large ectodomain of NCT plays an essential role in substrate recognition (24,25).",

In addition to its trafficking functions, TMP21 has been shown to specifically regulate proteolysis at the \u2425-secretase site, whereas no effects on \u2440-cleavage were observed (26,27,30). A C-terminal-truncated APP construct terminating at the \u2440-site was employed to allow investigation of TMP21 activity independent of \u2440-medi-ated cleavage (Fig. 1A). This APP\u2440 protein is recognized by an A\u2424 antibody targeting the N-terminal A\u2424 residues 1-17 (6E10) ( Fig. 1B) and undergoes normal processing by \u2423-, \u2424-, and \u2425-secretase to produce similar levels of A\u2424 peptides and soluble APP\u2423 (sAPP\u2423) fragment in the absence of AICD production (Fig. 1, C and D). Comparable findings have been previously reported which confirm that the APP\u2440 variant is comparable with the wild-type protein but permits examination of \u2425-secretase activities without any complicating factors associated with \u2440-related processing (28).",

This finding is consistent with previous investigations that demonstrated dual effects of TMP21 on \u2425-secretase activity and APP trafficking (26,27,30). However, unique effects in \u2425-cleavage were observed in cells coexpressing the APP\u2440 construct with TMP21. Immunoprecipitation and reprobing with an anti-A\u2424 antibody (6E10 N-terminal epitope) revealed the expected APP-CTF for the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B, short exposure, top panel). Upon longer exposure, two intracellular A\u2424-reactive bands were observed in cells expressing APP\u2440 at higher molecular weights than are seen for the synthetic A\u242440 peptide (Fig. 2B, long exposure, bottom panel). These A\u2424-reactive bands accumulated in the cells co-expressing TMP21.

The molecular weights of these TMP21-induced bands are in the range of \u2424-to-\u2440 A\u2424 (residues 1-49; molecular mass, 5.3 kDa) and possibly a \u2424\u0408-to-\u2440 fragment (residues 11-49; molecular mass, 4.1 kDa). These fragments also contained the A\u2424 N terminus as shown by their reactivity to different antibodies. A\u2424-positive species were isolated by immunoprecipitation from cells expressing APP\u2440 and probed with antibodies recognizing A\u2424 residues 1-17 (6E10) and 17-24 (4G8). The higher molecular weight bands induced by TMP21 expression were detected by both antibodies and were not seen in control mock-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). These data suggest that the bands are produced by normal cleavage at or near the \u2424-secretase site and their higher molecular weight as compared with A\u2424-(1-40) would be consistent with impaired \u2425-processing in the presence of TMP21. The molecular  weights of the bands are comparable with that of a synthetic A\u2424 1-49 peptide, which indicates that the A\u2424-positive fragments would be consistent with an incompletely processed A\u2424-containing APP\u2440 fragments (Fig. 3C). Similar bands were also observed in cells expressing the APP\u2440 isoform when treated with the \u2425-secretase inhibitor, Compound E, which supports the possibility that they are generated by impaired \u2425-processing (Fig. 3C).",

It should be noted that APP\u2440 is recovered in the membrane fraction, in agreement with the demonstration that APP\u2440 behaved as a membrane-bound type 1 protein as does \u2424APP (28). Probing with anti-A\u2424 (6E10) revealed the presence in the membrane fraction but not in the soluble fraction of the high molecular weight, presumably unprocessed fragments that were induced by TMP21 expression ( Fig. 4).

These results are reminiscent of recent reports describing an accumulation of intracellular longer A\u2424 species when \u2425-secretase activity is inhibited at the \u2425 site but not at the \u2440 site (31)(32)(33).

The chimeras all expressed at reasonable levels, suggesting that they were not misfolded or rapidly degraded. Two of the constructs, TMP21-TMCt and TMP21-TM, were found at slightly higher levels as compared with wild-type TMP21 and may, therefore, be well tolerated by the cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies were conducted for the FLAG-tagged proteins, which successfully pulled down all of the chimeras (Fig. 5C). FLAG-tagged wild-type TMP21 and p24a were used as controls, and as previously reported, TMP21 but not p24a interacts with mature Intracellular A\u2424 species were immunoprecipitated from membrane fractions using 6E10 antibody (6E10) in HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with APP\u2440 in the presence and absence of TMP21-FLAG, then detected by immunoblotting using 6E10 (A) or 4G8 (B) antibodies. C, HEK293 cells were transfected with APP\u2440 in the presence or absence of TMP21-TM, then treated or not with Compound E (100 nM). Intracellular A\u2424 species were then immunoprecipitated and detected using 6E10 antibody. Both TMP21-TM overexpression and Compound E treatment led to an accumulation of A\u2424-positive fragment. Synthetic A\u2424 standard peptides were used as molecular weight markers. FIGURE 4. TMP21-induced A\u2424 species are associated with the lipid bilayer. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the APP\u2440 vector in the presence or absence of wild-type TMP21. Empty vector (pcDNA3) was used as a negative control. Membrane and cytosolic soluble fractions were prepared and probed with anti-FLAG antibodies for TMP21 detection or immunoprecipitated (IP) using anti-A\u2424 6E10 and analyzed for detection of intracellular A\u2424 species.

            "text": "To investigate their functional aspects, TMP21 chimeras were cotransfected with APP\u2440. Full-length APP\u2440 was found to be expressed at higher levels for cells co-transfected with wild-type TMP21 or the chimeras TMP21-TMCt or TMP21-TM, containing the transmembrane domain (Fig. 6A). This phenomenon may be the result of the effect of TMP21 on APP trafficking as noted previous (30). Examination of the intracellular A\u2424-containing fragments by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting revealed that the two higher molecular weight species were only seen for the chimeras containing the TMP21 transmembrane domain (TMP21, TMP21-TMCt, and TMP21-TM, Fig. 6B). This is consistent with the observed interactions of the chimeras with PS1 and NCT which were dependent upon the TMP21 TM domain. The relative intensity of A\u2424-positive fragments observed in cells expressing TMP21-TMCt and TMP21-TM chimeras was higher than for the wild-type TMP21. This could be because of slightly higher levels of the chimeras, as FLAG immunoreactivities were more pronounced (Fig. 6A). Alternatively, this may reflect the fact that the chimeric proteins were more readily or efficiently incorporated into the \u2425-secretase complexes. Only a small proportion of the full-length TMP21 is incorporated into complexes, and therefore, replacement, for example, of the ectodomain in the chimeras may result in a more accessible conformation for secretase binding. Appearance of the A\u2424-positive fragments suggests that they may result from a decreased processing of the APP-CTF. It would, therefore, be predicted that a corresponding decrease in FIGURE 5.

Overexpression of full-length wild-type TMP21 and APP\u2440 did not result in any significant change in A\u2424 production (Fig. 6C). Levels were comparable with controls as well as cell transfected with the p24a homolog. This is consistent with other studies in whole cells where high levels of TMP21 were also shown to not have an appreciable effect on A\u2424 levels (26,27). Therefore, the A\u2424-positive fragments must represent only a small percentage of the total A\u2424. This could be because of a limited incorporation of full-length TMP21 into mature complexes. Similar issues with incorporation into functional complexes are seen for NCT, which is also not readily assembled into active complexes and accumulates as the immature species.",

This approach has been used previously for investigations into the membrane insertion and structure of the APP transmembrane helix (34). The TMP21 TM peptide (KKK-VLYFSIFSMFCLIGLATWQV-FYL-KKK) solubilized in DMSO was added at different concentrations to cells expressing the APP-Swedish variant, and A\u242440 secretion was measured in medium by ELISA analysis. After incubation for 8 h, cells exposed to 10 g/ml (final media concentration) of the TMP21 peptide reduced A\u242440 by \u03f317% (Fig.  7A). A dose response was observed at 30 g/ml peptide which produced an \u03f332% reduction in A\u2424 secretion. The corresponding p24a transmembrane peptide (KKK-VVLWSFFEALVL-VAMTLGQIYYL-KKK) had no statistically significant effects at either 10 or 30 g/ml (Fig. 7A). The reduction of A\u2424 levels was also not because of an inherently toxic effect of the TMP21 peptide that may have led to loss of production because of cell death. Viability assays indicated that no cell toxicity was associated with either the TMP21 or p24a peptides at the concentrations investigated (supplemental Fig. 1). The reduced A\u242440 trend for cells treated with the TMP21 peptide at longer conditioning time (e.g. 16 h) remained the same with comparable dose-dependent decreases for treatments with 10 and 30 g/ml (data not shown). Treatment of cells expressing APP\u2440 with the FIGURE 7. Synthetic transmembrane domain of TMP21 reduced A\u242440 secretion.

Membrane fractions were prepared from HEK293 cells and incubated with the synthetic TM peptides at various concentrations. Recombinant C100 protein was added to the reaction mixture, and A\u2424 production was assayed by ELISA. Incubation of membranes with the TMP21 or p24a transmembrane peptides at 10 g/ml did not have any detectable effect on A\u2424 levels (Fig. 7C). The TMP21 peptide had a modest effect at 30 g/ml which resulted in approximately a 10% reduction in A\u2424 production (Fig. 7C). A more pronounced decrease in A\u2424 was observed for membranes incubated with 60 g/ml of the TMP21 TM peptide which resulted in an \u03f350% reduction in A\u2424 processing. This was specific for the TMP21 peptide, as no significant difference was observed for the corresponding p24a TM peptide (Fig. 7C).",

            "text": "Relatively higher concentrations of the TMP21 transmembrane peptide were required in the cell-free assay to produce the same decrease in A\u2424 processing as compared with the live cell cultures. This may be because of the fact that the level of the C100 substrate is much higher in the cell-free assay. Therefore, if the TMP21 binds to the \u2425-secretase complex as proposed, then the higher amount of substrate could compete for binding sites in the \u2425-complex. As a result, increased amounts of the TMP21 transmembrane peptide would be required to displace and/or compete with the C100 substrate."

            "text": "Taken together, these observations have demonstrated that TMP21 expression has a unique effect on \u2425-secretase processing when examined in the absence of a possibly competing \u2440-mediated proteolysis. This was evident by the effects seen with the truncated APP\u2440 which led to the accumulation of A\u2424-containing membrane-embedded fragments. Because the AICD sequence, which is lacking in APP\u2440 construct, contains the YENP motif, essential for APP internalization (35), it is possible to envisage that TMP21 acts on \u2425-secretase activity and upstream APP recycling and preferentially targets the membrane-embedded A\u2424 fragment released after the \u2440-cleavage. However, this remains speculative, and the exact site of the twin function of TMP21 in terms of \u2425-secretase modulation and APP metabolism has yet to be elucidated. The direct activity of TMP21 on \u2425-secretase appeared to be primarily mediated by its transmembrane domain. It is likely that specific residues are responsible for these effects, and further mutagenesis studies may shed more light on this issue. However, the ability of the TMP21 peptide to alter APP processing and A\u2424 production could represent a novel strategy for modulating amyloid production and its subsequent pathology.",
