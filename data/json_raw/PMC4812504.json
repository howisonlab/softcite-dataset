            "text": "In 1989, Caffe et al. [1] published a method for organ culture in which the neuroretina was placed with the photoreceptor layer facing downward on rafts made of nitrocellulose filters and polyamide gauze grids. Since then, mammalian retinal organ cultures have been commonly used to research retinal physiology and pathobiology. Retinal cell dynamics have shown that organotypic models can be comparable with in vivo conditions, especially those of the outer retina [2]. Thus, retinal cultures are still used in electrophysiological studies to monitor drug effects on retinal cell functionality [3], to evaluate neurotrophic factors or physical tension on retinal cells [4], and to study the molecular basis of potential therapies for photoreceptor death [5]. Our group has previously used neuroretina explant cultures to evaluate modifications induced by exogenous cells such as blood-derived macrophages or by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) that are implicated in the pathobiology of proliferative vitreoretinopathy [6,7]. We have explored the potential role of therapeutic agents such as TNF-\u03b1-blockers [7]. We have also established a mixed coculture model composed of three cellular layers, the neuroretina, the RPE, and adipose tissue-derived stem cells, to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of stem cells [8].",

            "text": "There are some obvious limitations of these culture systems, such as the axotomy of ganglion cells as part of the dissection procedure and the absence of a blood supply. Thus, degenerative changes in retinal cells, especially at the inner retina, could differ from in vivo conditions [9]. In addition, a major limitation is the absence of the RPE. The RPE is a monolayer of pigmented, cuboidal epithelial cells that are closely associated with the photoreceptor outer segments. The most important functions of the RPE are the synthesis and maintenance of the interphotoreceptor matrix, photoreceptor membrane turnover, and retinoid metabolism [10]. The importance of the neuroretina-RPE association is supported by the fact that neuroretinas adjoined to RPE monolayer cultures have better-preserved tissue architecture in culture studies [11]. The RPE is also considered a key element in the development of some retinal diseases and, importantly, in the physiopathology of retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy. In these pathologies, the neuroretina and the RPE become physically separated. Furthermore, the RPE secretes across the apical membrane neuroprotective factors that helps to maintain retinal homeostasis [10]. Thus, an adequate ex vivo tool for studying retinal degeneration and the importance of molecular signaling across the subretinal space after physical separation of the neuroretina and the RPE would be inherent to overcome the complexities that are inherent in vivo studies.",

This arrangement prevented any physical contact between the cocultured cells but allowed signal molecules to pass between them. This model could be useful for studying in vitro the interactions between the neuroretina and the RPE when they lose their natural contact, as happens in several retinal diseases such as retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy. Further, this ex vivo model will allow study of the role of RPE-secreted factors and the evaluation of potential therapies for reducing the progression of neuroretina degeneration.",

The neuroretina explants were laid over the Transwell \u00ae membranes (24-mm diameter with 0.4-\u00b5m pore polycarbonate membrane insert; Product #3412, Corning Inc.) with the photoreceptor layer facing the membrane. Nine neuroretina explants were cocultured with RPE cells but physically separated from them by the culture medium overlying the RPE cells and the Transwell \u00ae membrane ( Figure 2). Another nine explants were cultured as controls without RPE cells. Cultures were maintained in 1:1 Neurobasal-A/DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% B-27 (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture and maintained in standard culture conditions. The culture medium level (1.5 ml as suggested by the manufacturer) was maintained in contact with the support membrane beneath the explants and changed with freshly prepared, warmed medium every day. The explants were harvested for analysis after 9 days of culture, as previously described by our group [14], and were cut into two halves for subsequent processing. Two fresh central neuroretina specimens were used as culture day 0 samples and processed in parallel.",

Neuroretina immunohistochemistry during the culture and coculture period. In the freshly isolated retina explants (A), RHO immunoreactivity (green) showed the normal appearance of rod outer segments (OS). At 9 days of neuroretina explants culture alone (B), RHO was scarcely detected, and the inner segments (IS) were not discernable. Photoreceptor nuclei appeared at the IS region (B, arrowhead). At 9 days in coculture with RPE cells (C), RHO was displaced to the short and swollen rod IS and to the outer nuclear layer (arrows). In the freshly isolated retina explants (D), CB (red) showed cone photoreceptors with normal morphology. At 9 days of neuroretina culture alone (E), cone morphology was markedly altered as revealed with CB immunostaining. At 9 days in coculture with the RPE (F), cone morphology underwent degeneration. In the freshly isolated retina explants (G), CRALBP (green) showed M\u00fcller cells with normal morphology. Reduced immunostaining for GFAP (red) was observed. At 9 days of neuroretina culture alone (H), GFAP was upregulated at the cytoplasm of glial cells, and GFAP-positive extensions formed a layered-like structure outside the retinal tissue (arrows). At 9 days in coculture with RPE (I), CRALBP was scarcely detected, and GFAP was reduced compared to explants cultured alone. GFAPpositive processes were present over the outer limiting membrane (arrows). OS=outer segments; IS=inner segments; ONL=outer nuclear layer; INL=inner nuclear layer; GCL=ganglion cell layer.

            "text": "The present study described the development and characterization of a novel coculture model of cone-dominated porcine central retina and RPE cells to closely simulate ex vivo the subretinal space microenvironment. Retinal degeneration is a common finding of many retinal diseases, and in some cases, such as retinal detachment and central serous chorioretinopathy, it is in part the consequence of physical separation between the neuroretina and the RPE. This separation starts a cascade of events that result in cellular changes throughout the retina. These events are in part responsible for the poor functional results that can occur even after successful reattachment surgery [18]. Currently, research in retinal degeneration is largely limited due to the difficulty in obtaining specimens from freshly detached human retinas and the limitations of experimental animal models [19]. In this sense, simple neuroretina cultures represent a useful tool for studying retinal modifications. These models are inexpensive and easy to develop. Importantly, they closely simulate in vivo retinal cellular and molecular dynamics and have been the source of improved knowledge of retinal physiopathology in recent decades [1]. Nevertheless, these previously reported culture models lack the influence of the RPE cells that are necessary for maintaining the viability and functionality of the outermost retinal layers [10]. Furthermore, RPE cells secrete various growth and trophic factors that act on the neuroretina and the choroidal endothelium [10]. The RPE also plays an important role in the retinal degeneration process and is considered a key element in retinal detachment physiopathology [19].",

However, neuroretina organotypic cultures are still considered an adequate tool for improving knowledge of retinal physiopathology [3]. Other authors have previously described models in which RPE monolayers were cocultured in contact with the neuroretina [11]. Those models are complex to develop and do not adequately mimic a retinal pathology related to the separation between the neuroretina and the RPE. Our purpose was to study and characterize the differences between neuroretinas cultured alone and those cocultured with RPE cells while physically separated from each other. This novel model could be the basis for studying Figure 6. Porcine neuroretina thickness during the culture and coculture period. Neuroretina tissue thickness (A) on day 9 of culture and on day 9 of coculture with RPE was reduced compared to the freshly isolated tissue. The thickness of the neuroretina cultures alone on day 9 was significantly less than that of the neuroretinas that had been cocultured with RPE. ONL (B) and INL (C) thickness on day 9 of culture and on day 9 of coculture with RPE was reduced compared to the freshly isolated tissue.

In this scenario, RPE-secreted factors can diffuse through the cell culture membrane pores and influence neuroretina cell dynamics, thus recreating the subretinal space milieu.",

This zone is a broad horizontal retinal streak above the optic disc, with high cone density and without direct vascularization [13]. Unlike the human fovea, no depression is present throughout the pig area centralis [13]. The porcine retina has a rod density that is similar to that of humans, and the cellular dynamics after neuroretina-RPE separation are comparable in both species, especially those of key cells such as M\u00fcller and RPE cells [20]. Therefore, in the coculture model that we have developed, we used explants from the porcine cone-dominated area centralis because of the similarity with the human central retina.",

As previously described in primary RPE cell cultures, a few clusters of cells became partially dedifferentiated [22]. CRALBP immunoexpression was not observed in RPE cells cocultured with neuroretinas, probably due to the loss of normal cell polarization, especially seen as the disappearance of the apical microvilli [21].

However, the presence of degenerative rosette-like structures reported here were not observed by our group in previous work in which the central retina was not used [14]. Degenerative rosettes commonly occur in abnormally developing retinas [24]. Our immunohistochemical studies revealed retinal cell degenerative modifications as we [6,7] and others previously described in organotypic porcine retina cultures [9]. Although RHO and CRALBP immunoexpression was better preserved and lower levels of GFAP were detected in the neuroretinas cocultured with RPE cells, we did not quantify the GFAP or CRALBP labeling, and this will be part of future experiments. The thickness of the neuroretinas was greater in the cocultures. However, it is not clear if that is related to cellular swelling or to better cellular viability. In this sense, it will be useful to explore cell death and survival in future studies. In any case, the neuroretina explants cocultured with RPE cells maintained better preserved tissue and cellular characteristics and significantly better conserved tissue and nuclear layer thicknesses. These findings were consistent through the complete 5-mm neuroretina explants and were observed in all the experiments performed.",

            "text": "Conclusions: Our group has developed and standardized a novel coculture model of central cone-dominated porcine neuroretina that was supplemented with RPE cells maintained separately within the same culture wells. This coculture system mimics ex vivo the subretinal space that develops during retinal detachment (RD) and other disease conditions of the retina. Compared to the neuroretina explant cultures alone, the presence of cocultured RPE provided improved neuroretina architecture and thickness, better preservation of RHO and CRALBP immunoexpression, and lower levels of GFAP. These data suggest that the cocultured RPE, while not in direct contact with the neuroretina explant, had a neuroprotective role. This effect may be linked to the beneficial effects of neurotrophic factors secreted or induced by RPE cells during coculture. Furthermore, the proposed model will be useful to better study interactions between the RPE and the neuroretina and to test neuroprotective and/or antiinflammatory drugs for retinal degenerative diseases.",
