            "text": "Background: Head or anterior body part regeneration is commonly associated with protostome, but not deuterostome invertebrates. However, it has been shown that the solitary hemichordate Ptychodera flava possesses the remarkable capacity to regenerate their entire nervous system, including their dorsal neural tube and their anterior head-like structure, or proboscis. Hemichordates, also known as acorn worms, are marine invertebrate deuterostomes that have retained chordate traits that were likely present in the deuterostome ancestor, placing these animals in a vital position to study regeneration and chordate evolution. All acorn worms have a tripartite body plan, with an anterior proboscis, middle collar region, and a posterior trunk. The collar houses a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates and numerous chordate genes involved in brain and spinal cord development are expressed in a similar anterior-posterior spatial arrangement along the body axis. Results: We have examined anterior regeneration in the hemichordate Ptychodera flava and report the spatial and temporal morphological changes that occur. Additionally, we have sequenced, assembled, and analyzed the transcriptome for eight stages of regenerating P. flava, revealing significant differential gene expression between regenerating and control animals. Conclusions: Importantly, we have uncovered developmental steps that are regeneration-specific and do not strictly follow the embryonic program.",

            "text": "Regeneration has captured the interest and imagination of people for centuries. Popularized in myths, science fiction, and even horror movies, regeneration of missing and damaged tissue is a common reality in the animal kingdom. Nearly every animal phyla contains at least some species that consistently regenerate all or certain tissues and structures (Bely and Nyberg, 2010;Somorjai et al., 2012;Giangrande and Licciano, 2014). All deuterostome groups, with the possible exception of Xenoturbella, have at least some species with the capacity to regenerate (S anchez Alvarado, 2000). Numerous chordates, including lancelets, tunicates, frogs, fish, salamanders, and even humans are able to regenerate to some degree (Brown et al., 2009;Bely and Nyberg, 2010;Somorjai et al., 2012;Giangrande and Licciano, 2014). Every extant class of echinoderms have been reported to regenerate (Candia Carnevali et al., 2009), while some species of hemichordates, which are a sister group to the echinoderms, undergo asexual reproduction and regenerate all anterior and posterior body parts when amputated (Willey 1899;Dawydoff 1902;Rao 1954;Rychel and Swalla, 2008;Humphreys et al., 2010;.",

Millions of people suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord injuries, and limb amputations (Brown et al., 2005;Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008;Mahabaleshwarkar and Khanna, 2014). Furthermore, aging and age-related diseases will eventually affect everyone. Regeneration may slow the aging process and stem cells present one feasible way to combat a multitude of diseases and injuries (Rando and Wyss-Coray, 2014). If regeneration is a stem deuterostome trait, it is likely that humans possess many, if not all, of the genetic switches controlling regeneration, but those switches have been modified or inactivated in some way over evolutionary time. It may, therefore, be possible to re-activate those pathways in humans using information gained from studying genetic models made from animals with extensive regenerative capabilities.",

            "text": "We are seeking to identify the morphological and genetic underpinnings controlling regeneration in the solitary hemichordate, Ptychodera flava (Eschscholtz, 1825), which is a basal deuterostome and capable of regenerating all anterior and posterior structures when bisected (Rychel and Swalla, 2008;Humphreys et al., 2010). It is critical to know when internal structures regenerate to use genetic knock downs and knock outs, as well as overexpression, to characterize the function of genes directing the regeneration process. Moreover, hemichordates are the only deuterostome known to be able to regenerate an anterior head-like structure and entire central nervous system (CNS). Ptychodera flava progresses from a fertilized embryo to a planktonic, feeding larva that can remain in the water column for up to 300 days (Hadfield, 1978;Lin et al., 2016). Upon metamorphosis, the larva develops into a juvenile worm that settles to the ocean floor to begin a benthic lifestyle. Solitary hemichordates are exclusively marine and adult animals have a tripartite body plan with an anterior proboscis that is used for digging and burrowing in the sand and mud, a middle collar region with a hollow, dorsal neural tube in ptychoderid hemichordates, a ventral mouth between the proboscis and collar, and a long posterior trunk with pharyngeal gill slits and gonads in the anterior trunk, a hepatic region in the mid-trunk and a terminal anus (Balser and Ruppert, 1990;Brown et el., 2008;Luttrell and Swalla, 2014). The hemichordate nervous system is quite interesting. Upon embryogenesis in direct developing hemichordates and metamorphosis in indirect developers, dorsal and ventral nerve cords develop along the full length of the trunk and nerve rings form around the base of the collar and the base of the proboscis (Balser and Ruppert, 1990;Kaul and Stach, 2010;Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015). Adult echinoderms also develop nerve cords throughout each arm and a circumferential nerve ring around the central disc; however, it still remains to be determined whether echinoderm and hemichordate nerve cords are homologous structures (Sly et al., 2002;Holland et al., 2013). In addition to nerve cords, P. flava also develops a hollow, neural tube that is positioned dorsally in the collar region. Our lab has shown this structure forms from ectoderm that invaginates and rolls up forming a hollow tube, similar to chordate neurulation (Morgan, 1894;Luttrell et al., 2012;Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;Luttrell and Swalla, 2014).",

The adult acorn worm, in light of these similarities, has aspects of the different types of nervous systems that are present in the deuterostomes. Remarkably, P. flava is able to regenerate all of these structures, making hemichordates a model system to study nervous system evolution and regeneration in this clade of animals. Furthermore, as invertebrates, hemichordates lack the numerous genome duplications events present in the vertebrates (Dehal and Boore, 2005;Hughes and Liberles, 2008), thereby making functional studies of the regeneration genes more tractable in this animal.",

We also include analyses of the transcriptome from regenerating P. flava animals. In total, eight different stages of regeneration were sequenced, assembled, and annotated to track changes in early gene expression that direct regeneration of anterior structures. We document expression profiles and gene ontologies of hundreds of putative genes associated with anterior head regeneration. These data build a foundation for future experiments that may show what genes are sufficient and necessary to start the regeneration program in P. flava. Our morphological data shows the regenerative response to these early changes in gene expression and we document complete anterior regeneration of the proboscis, collar, and anterior trunk. Furthermore, we uncovered morphological differences between early development and regeneration of anterior structures, including the neural tube. The assembled transcriptomes reported here not only complement recent P. flava developmental transcriptomes (Shu-Hwa et al., 2014;Tagawa et al., 2014;Simakov et al., 2015), but also open the door to systematic comparisons of embryonic processes to regenerative events in hemichordates specifically, and deuterostomes in general.",

Wound healing culminates in ectoderm covering and sealing the open cut site (Fig. 1D-F). Over the next 3 days, a regeneration blastema forms at the anterior end (Fig. 1G,H). Cells accumulate and proliferate in the blastema to yield a new, rudimentary anterior head, or proboscis ( Fig. 1I).

            "text": "As the proboscis grows, anterior internal tissues continue to be elaborated. Hemichordates are tricoelomates, having separate coeloms in the proboscis, collar, and trunk regions. The proboscis coelom is fully formed after 4 days of regeneration ( Fig. 3D1-3). The dorsal blood vessel flows anteriorly from the trunk, through the collar, ultimately forming the heart in the posterior proboscis (Benito and Pardos, 1997). The dorsal vessel has regenerated into the proboscis, filling the coelom with blood at 4 days postamputation ( Fig. 3D1-3). The mouth, which was visible in the external morphology at day 5, is clearly open in sagittal sections at day 4 ( Fig. 3D1-3). The stomochord is a stiff, rod-like structure in the posterior proboscis and provides structural support for the superimposing heart/kidney complex (Balser and Ruppert, 1990;Rychel and Swalla, 2008;Miyamoto and Wada, 2013). The stomochord is apparent in sections after 5 days of regeneration . At this stage, the stomochord forms between the boundary where ectoderm and endoderm meet. At this time, the heartkidney complex regenerates in the lateral and dorsal positions around the stomochord ( Fig. 3E1-4). The dorsal blood vessel is obvious at this stage, flowing into the proboscis just above the stomochord where the heart/kidney complex is regenerating ( Fig.  3E1-4). The ventral blood vessel is supplying blood and cells to the presumptive ventral collar coelom as well ( Fig. 3E1-4). One day later, the regenerated collar coeloms can be seen in the dorsal and ventral regions ( Fig. 3F1-4). The proboscis skeleton provides structure and support for the collar and overlying dorsal blood vessel and neural tube (Luttrell et al., 2012). The proboscis skeleton regenerates from endoderm in the collar region and is visible in endodermal inpocketing at 13 days postamputation (Fig. 4P). The hollow, dorsal neural tube, which is found only in the collar region in ptychoderid hemichordates, begins to form in the posterior collar as the ectoderm closes on the dorsal side at 13 days postbisection ( Fig. 4T). These morphological regenerative events are summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "Regeneration of these morphological structures is driven by a significant change in gene expression as evidenced by the transcriptome data. A line graph was constructed to show clusters of upregulated, putative genes showing similar expression profiles along all time points sampled ( Fig. 5A). Nearly all genes in cluster A are significantly up-regulated 2 hr after the animal is bisected; however, the expression level of these genes steadily and drastically declines beginning 6 hr into the regeneration process. A heatmap of cluster A identifies the individual, putative genes and their expression profile across all time points (Fig. 5B). Heatmaps of the genes in cluster B shows overall expression is near baseline values at the 2-hr time point, but then expression increases significantly after 6 hr and is elevated approximately 8-fold higher than control animals after 4 days of regeneration ( Fig. 5C). Heatmaps of the cluster C and cluster D genes show similar expression profiles, both being only slightly elevated after 2 hr of regeneration and then progressively increasing until the 24-hr time point, at which time both clusters begin to show decreased expression levels, with cluster C displaying the most dramatic decrease (Fig. 5D,E). However, expression of putative genes in both clusters still remain over two log fold change higher than controls after 4 days of regeneration. Down-regulated, putative genes were also identified and grouped into clusters of similar expression domains. A line graph shows four clusters of predicted genes with very different expression profiles (Fig. 6A). Heatmaps of cluster A show overall expression levels slightly below baseline values between 2 and 6 hr of regeneration and then expression gradually decreases with a steep decline between 3 and 4 days of regeneration. A detailed listing of these putative genes is included in Figure 7. Cluster B genes also start off at near baseline values and expression steadily decreases; however, this group of genes reverses at the 48-hr time point and expression levels begin to increase, although overall expression of this cluster remains significantly down-regulated at the 96-hr time point compared with control animals (Fig. 8).",

The collar and trunk then differentiate and the trunk elongates. One difference between development and regeneration, however, is that gill slits start to regenerate before the collar has fully formed, unlike early development in direct developing hemichordates when gill slits form after the collar and trunk have delineated from one another (Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013;Kaul-Strehlow et al., 2015).",

Few studies directly compare development or regeneration of the neural tube and gill slits in ptychoderid worms, but two studies state that the collar develops or regenerates before the branchial region Hay-Schmidt, 2007: Humphreys et al., 2010). This is not evidence that the neural tube specifically has developed at this point and future studies will need to confirm the timing of development of the neural tube compared with development of the branchial region in P. flava. These differences, however, do show a potential temporal plasticity during regeneration of anterior structures in P. flava.",

The question remains whether these proliferating cells are bona fide stem cells occupying an unknown niche that are recruited to the cut site or are these somatic cells that have undergone de-differentiation and returned to a progenitor cell state and then assigned new fates in the regenerating tissue? Numerous genes in P. flava are both up-and downregulated beginning just 2 hr after the animal is bisected. Differential gene expression increases rapidly during the early time DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS points sampled in this study resulting in wound healing and may drive regeneration through the recruitment of stem cells to the cut site forming the regeneration blastema within 3 to 4 days postamputation. Rychel and Swalla (2008) showed that proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells are found in scattered mesenchyme cells throughout the tissue near the cut site by day 2 of regeneration at 28 C in P. flava. There is some slight variation in wound healing and blastema growth times between the results reported by Rychel and Swalla (2008) and here, but the overall results are consistent. Our lab is currently working to determine the origin and molecular profile of these proliferating cells to verify whether these are stem cells or de-differentiated somatic cells. We are using stem cell markers in regenerating and nonregenerating animals to detect molecular signatures consistent with known stem cell lines.",

The mouth, which is critical to feeding and thereby supports the high metabolic cost of regeneration, forms and opens after just 4 days. The worm does not burrow and ingest sand to deposit feed at this point; however, they are likely taking in organic nutrients suspended in the water column. Regenerating worms start to burrow in sand around 10 days postbisection. Blood vessels and mechanical support elements for vital organs and tissues also seem to be essential as these are among the first internal structures in the new tissue. The stomochord in the posterior proboscis is vacuolated and acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, providing support for the heartkidney complex (Miyamoto and Wada, 2013). Several studies have shown that, in both direct and indirect developing acorn worms, the stomochord is elaborated from endoderm during juvenile worm development (Kaul-Strehlow and Stach, 2013;Miyamoto and Wada, 2013;Satoh et al., 2014). At 3 days postbisection, we show what may be the presumptive stomochord regenerating from endoderm; however, the identity of this structure is not clear. At this stage, it is not positioned directly below the future heart/kidney complex in the proboscis as the stomochord should be, but rather it is more internal in the presumptive collar region. This structure could also be the hydropore, which is a rounded tube, but that is also not in the correct position, as the hydropore is in the dorsal proboscis/collar ectoderm region and expels circulating waste from the proboscis coelom to the environment (R\u20ac ottinger and Martindale, 2011). It may be that the angle of the sections is not exactly sagittal, at which point internal structures may appear skewed. It may also be that regenerating structures look out of place during the early stages. Future studies will be needed using molecular markers to confirm the identity of this structure.",

A key difference is that the proboscis skeleton and dorsal vessel regenerate before neural tube regeneration. During normal development this process is reversed and the dorsal vessel and neural tube develop before the proboscis skeleton (Luttrell et al., 2012). Another major difference is the way the neural tube regenerates. During normal development, dorsal collar ectoderm invaginates, rolls up forming a hollow tube. During regeneration, the neural tube begins to form at day 13 as the collar ectoderm nears closure on the dorsal side. It is the closure of this ectoderm that actually forms the tube and not from invaginating ectoderm after the collar fully regenerates and closes.",

The anterior most branchial region closest to the collar is clear to white, while the posterior regenerating branchial region closest to the original cut site contains pigmented cells.

This suggests that, while the anterior most branchial tissue is likely elaborated from newly generated, unpigmented proliferating cells, the cells in the tissue closest to the cut site undergo apoptosis and the tissue is remodeled from the existing cells in the hepatic region.

            "text": "Several studies have detailed expression of genes involved with chordate brain and spinal cord development in the direct developing hemichordate, Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Lowe et al., 2003;Pani et al., 2012: R\u20ac ottinger and. These orthologous genes show a similar spatial distribution of chordate patterning along the anterior-posterior body axis in S. kowalevskii. Numerous chordate forebrain genes are expressed in the developing hemichordate proboscis region while chordate midbrain genes are expressed in the hemichordate collar region and chordate hindbrain and spinal cord genes are expressed in the hemichordate trunk region (Lowe et al., 2003;Pani et al., 2012;R\u20ac ottinger and Lowe, 2012). These overlapping similarities suggest that at least parts of the gene regulatory networks that pattern the chordate CNS were likely present in the common ancestor of the deuterostomes and the hemichordate proboscis and collar could be considered an early representation of the chordate head. No chordate has been shown to regenerate an anterior head or CNS after complete amputation and, therefore, hemichordates are vital to revealing gene networks regulating CNS regeneration in the deuterostomes.",

            "text": "We compared regeneration in P. flava and identified several putative orthologs of chordate CNS patterning genes that are upregulated after 3 and 4 days of regeneration. The regeneration blastema has formed at these time points, and cells continue to proliferate to generate a rudimentary proboscis at 3 to 4 days postbisection of the animal. Sine oculis homeobox 3 (six3), distal-less (dll), paired box homeobox 6 (pax6), and frizzled-5 are all significantly up-regulated at the 96-hr time point, which is just as the proboscis begins to form. Six3, Pax6, and dll are transcription factors that are involved with patterning the chordate forebrain (Echevarria et al., 2003;Wilson and Houart, 2004;Paek et al., 2009). Frizzled-related Wnt antagonists have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to establish the telencephalon region of the chordate brain (Houart et al., 2002;Paek et al., 2009). Of the 26 putative transcription factors identified as being differentially expressed in this study, 7 of them are known to be involved in head and neural development and they are all significantly up-regulated 3 and 4 days into regeneration as the rudimentary proboscis is beginning to form. It is likely that other chordate head genes are up-regulated during anterior regeneration in P. flava, but they are possibly expressed at later time points as the proboscis continues to regenerate and the collar begins to form. Future studies will be aimed at identifying these transcripts and their expression domains.",

There is extensive temporal plasticity during regeneration, as well as different modes of acquiring the same anterior structures. Putative orthologs of chordate head genes are also significantly up-regulated just before anterior proboscis regeneration. It will be interesting and informative to discover whether additional head genes are expressed as the proboscis and collar undergo regeneration and we will then use in situ hybridization to localize gene expression in regenerating tissues.",
