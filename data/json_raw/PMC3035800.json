While numerous methods and tools exist for tracking cells in 2D time-lapse images, only few and very application-specific tracking tools are available for 3D timelapse images, which is of high relevance in immunoimaging, in particular for studying the motility of microglia in vivo. Results: We introduce a novel algorithm for tracking cells in 3D time-lapse microscopy data, based on computing cosegmentations between component trees representing individual time frames using the so-called tree-assignments. For the first time, our method allows to track microglia in three dimensional confocal time-lapse microscopy images. We also evaluate our method on synthetically generated data, demonstrating that our algorithm is robust even in the presence of different types of inhomogeneous background noise.",

            "text": "Capturing the motility of cells using time-lapse microscopy has become an important approach to understanding processes such as the cell cycle (Harder et al., 2009), neuronal division and migration (Norden et al., 2009), immune response (Cahalan and Parker, 2008) or the development of cancer (Ianzini et al., 2009). Based on phase-contrast, confocal or two-photon microscopy, such live cell imaging protocols are now commonly established and corresponding equipment is commonly available. This has triggered the need for computational methods to quantitatively analyze timelapse microscopy data. In this context, identifying individual cells and tracking their identities over time is one of the basic ingredients for computational analysis. Hence, cell tracking algorithms have attracted considerable attention in recent years (Meijering et al., 2006;Miura, 2005). Here, we introduce a novel algorithm for cell tracking that allows to track cells, in particular zebrafish microglia, in 3D two-photon image sequences over time.",

            "text": "The majority of cell tracking algorithms, as surveyed by Meijering et al. (2006) or Miura (2005), deals with cell tracking in 2D over time. Methods range from linking cells identified in individual frames using different segmentation approaches to active-contour (Dufour et al., 2005;Sacan et al., 2008;Shen et al., 2006) or level-set algorithms (Dzyubachyk et al., 2008;Li et al., 2008b;Mukherjee et al., 2004;Nath et al., 2006). The challenges imposed by the nature of the images to be analyzed lie in phenomena such as cell divisions (Al-Kofahi et al., 2006;Li et al., 2008a), cells entering or leaving the displayed area, or a large number of cells that needs to be tracked simultaneously. In addition, cell tracking is often complicated by background inhomogeneity, for instance due to uneven illumination (Leong et al., 2003), and cells touching each other. While these issues have been addressed extensively for tracking cells in 2D, surprisingly few approaches have addressed cell tracking in 3D. Besides naive thresholding approaches, there are only few advanced approaches, such as the active-contour based method proposed by Dufour et al. (2005). Recently, several authors (Jaensch et al., 2010;Kerekes et al., 2009) proposed reliable methods for tracking centrosomes in Caenorhabditise legans embryos. Yet, these approaches are tailored toward tracking small, bright and circular objects which e.g. resemble a Gaussian spot of a specific size. Such assumptions, however, are not satisfied by the complex and highly variable shapes of microglia under consideration here. Cell tracking is also relevant in the context of tracking cell populations in vitro, which has attracted considerable attention recently (House et al., 2009;Ong et al., 2010;Padfield et al., 2009).",

Otsu's early and still commonly used approach (Otsu, 1975) picks a cut-off intensity based on the gray-value histogram of an image, considering pixel intensities below this threshold as background and pixels exceeding the threshold intensity as foreground. To deal with background inhomogeneities and objects of varying intensities, different approaches such as locally adaptive thresholding (Kim and Park, 2005) have been developed. Our approach utilizes a highly systematic way of picking local thresholds in a hierarchical representation of all possible thresholds of an image, the socalled component tree (Jones, 1999;Najman and Couprie, 2004). In order to pick local thresholds in the component tree, we compare the component trees of consecutive time frames by solving the so-called tree assignment problem, a natural generalization of bipartite matchings and the associated assignment problem. Comparing component trees by computing tree assignments yields a cosegmentation of two images; for cell tracking, cosegmentations between two time frames in a video sequence are of particular relevance.",

Applying tree assignments to component trees for obtaining cosegmentations is a novel contribution in this work. In fact, cosegmentations promise to be useful in other bioimaging (and eventually image processing) applications beyond cell tracking. One straightforward application where cosegmentation is of high relevance are protein colocalization studies. Studying colocalization has recently become of relevance through the availability of corresponding two-or multi-label fluorescence microscopy (Schubert et al., 2006;Zinchuk and Zinchuk, 2008) or in situ hybridization (Boettiger and Levine, 2009;Carson et al., 2009) techniques.",

The set of all connected components under all thresholds is obviously hierarchically ordered by subset inclusion. This hierarchical order defines the component tree, which can be computed in linear time (Najman and Couprie, 2004). For examples of 1D images and their component trees refer to Figure 2. Figure 3 illustrates the basic steps of our cell tracking algorithm. The outline of the algorithm is as follows: we start with computing and pruning component trees for each time frame. Then, tree assignments between each pair of consecutive component trees are computed. The tree assignments can be turned into segmentations of the original images. This produces two segmentations of each image, requiring computation of a consensus segmentation. The resulting unique segmentation of each image then requires a standard bipartite matching between consecutive time frames to track cell identities over time.

Pruning is a crucial ingredient of our algorithm, as running tree assignments on the complete component trees would be computationally too demanding. The goal of pruning is thus to eliminate as many vertices as possible, keeping only those that reflect the relevant structures of the underlying image.

Yet, ct3d identifies microglia as segments that can be visually distinguished from non-microglia segments by a human observer due to their characteristic shape or motion patterns. The To assess the quality of tracking results, we derived the number of identified cells, the voxel recall, i.e. what percentage of all ground truth object voxels was recovered in the tracking result, as well as the error rate defined as the ratio between the cardinality of the symmetric difference between tracking result and ground truth and the total number of voxels in the ground truth dataset.

The at3d tool also allows to manually correct for the occasionally observed events of oversegmentation, i.e. one microglia being recognized as two segments. We used at3d to eliminate non-microglia from all six datasets and correct oversegmentation in individual frames. We were able to reconstruct trajectories of all relevant microglia that can be visually identified in the original datasets; only one dataset was affected by a sudden 'frameshift', i.e. the sample changing its distance to the camera in the z direction, leading to interrupted trajectories at the corresponding time frame. In few other cases, the trajectory of a microglia was interrupted in individual frames, which we could correct using at3d. Examples of the final results are given in Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.",

To this end, we selected four microglia from four different datasets and annotated their trajectories manually using the 3D polyline markup feature of the v3d software. The root mean square distance between the ct3d and the manual trajectories turned out to be 2.9 voxels, 5.5 voxels, 2.6 voxels and 5.4 voxels, respectively, in the four different datasets. These deviations can be considered relatively small in relation to the cell diameters, which were measured as 22.8, 22, 19.6 and 44.3 voxels, respectively. We also applied the active-contour approach from Chan and Vese (2001) to the datasets. Identifying the the four microglia in our annotated evaluation dataset required intensive tuning of the four major parameters. In fact, we could not identify a single set of parameters that works across all datasets. A parameter set tuned for a specific dataset worked comparably well on the respective dataset, but performed significantly worse or yielded no result on other datasets, see Figure 6.",

We demonstrate that this approach is robust against the numerous challenges imposed by images measured in an in vivo environment, and allows to identify microglia and their motion patterns in zebrafish neural tissue when combined with the at3d annotation tool. In a quantitative evaluation, we show that our approach is robust against different types of background inhomogeneities. This suggests that ct3d and at3d are potentially useful for in vivo imaging studies investigating other aspects than just microglia motility. In its current formulation, our cosegmentation approach relies on the assumption that the area occupied by an object overlaps between two consecutive time points. While this may not be satisfied in all cell tracking problems [e.g. when tracking centrosomes (Jaensch et al., 2010)], it is a reasonable assumption for many immunoimaging-related studies.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that can identify and track microglia in live cell imaging time series. In most cases, obtaining reliable trajectories still requires manual post-processing of the output. The most notorious difficulties certainly are the complex morphology-their deformation patterns, irregular shapes and interaction with the surrounding-as well as the unspecificity of the fluorescent markers available. In this light, our approach constitutes significant progress in the sense that it has sufficient sensitivity to separate microglia form their surrounding. Yet, a fully automated approach remains a major and certainly non-trivial challenge. A first step in this direction might be the combination with level-set based approaches as utilized for 2D cell  Chan and Vese (2001). In general, ct3d could identify the annotated cells in all time frames (columns # Frames). The root mean square distance to the annotated trajectory measures a fraction of the diameter of the annotated cell (columns cell and RMS), while the Chan-Vese algorithm missed varying numbers of cells or failed completely (last column). For the Chan-Vese results, a parameter set was optimized for dataset (a). This parameter set (\u00b5 = 1, \u03bd = .5, \u03bb 1 = .2, \u03bb 2 = 5) was also applied to datasets (b) to (d). While for dataset (a), the result is comparable to ct3d, the annotated cell was identified in only 29 out of 49 time frames in (b). In datasets (c) and (d), the annotated cell could not be identified at all using these parameters. See Supplementary Figure S2 for further illustrations.",
